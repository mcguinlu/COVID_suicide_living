0,Household transmission in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Metropolitan Lima,"Objective: Describe the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection among household members with a confirmed primary case of COVID-19 in low burden districts in Metropolitan Lima. Materials and Methods: A retrospective, secondary database review study was conducted. The information was collected from an epidemiological surveillance activity in close contacts (co-inhabitants) in 52 households in Metropolitan Lima with only one member with COVID-19. A reevaluation was carried out in 10 households. Epidemiological and clinical variables were evaluated and its association with the result of the rapid serological test (presence of IgG, IgM or both). Results: Secondary cases were found in 40 households, which represents an average of 49.9% identification per household. A secondary attack rate of 53.0% (125 cases) was found among cohabitants, with 77.6% of cases being symptomatic (symptomatic / asymptomatic ratio: 3.5). The presence of fever and / or chills was found in 40.0% of people with a positive result, followed by a sore throat, in 39.2%. Ageusia and anosmia were present in 22.4% and 20.8% of cases, respectively. A reevaluation in 40 family members 33.6 +/- 2.7 days after the first evaluation, show the persistence of positive IgM and IgG in the 20 positive cases in the first evaluation. Conclusion: Having a primary case of COVID-19 in home, the secondary attack rate of this infection is 53%; however, in a significant proportion of households evaluated there was no positive case, beyond the primary case. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics found in this case were in accordance with what has already been reported in other international series.","Angulo-Bazan, Y.; Solis, G.; Acosta, J.; Cardenas, F.; Jorge, A.; Cabezas, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189456v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189456v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
1,Early Evidence of Effectiveness of Digital Contact Tracing for SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland,"In the wake of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), contact tracing has become a key element of strategies to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). Given the rapid and intense spread of SARS-CoV-2, digital contact tracing has emerged as a potential complementary tool to support containment and mitigation efforts. Early modelling studies highlighted the potential of digital contact tracing to break transmission chains, and Google and Apple subsequently developed the Exposure Notification (EN) framework, making it available to the vast majority of smartphones. A growing number of governments have launched or announced EN-based contact tracing apps, but their effectiveness remains unknown. Here, we report early findings of the digital contact tracing app deployment in Switzerland. We demonstrate proof-of-principle that digital contact tracing reaches exposed contacts, who then test positive for SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that digital contact tracing is an effective complementary tool for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Continued technical improvement and international compatibility can further increase the efficacy, particularly also across country borders.","Salathe, M.; Althaus, C.

2,The Geography of Excess Deaths in England during the Covid-19 pandemic: Longer term impacts and monthly dynamics,"Physical social interaction relevant to the spread of infectious diseases occurs, by its nature, at a local level. If infection and related mortality are associated with social background, it is therefore natural to study variation in them in relation to the social composition of local areas. The first part of the paper studies the geographical impact of Covid-19 infection on age-standardised sex-specific excess death rates during the peak months of the pandemic so far, March through May 2020. The second part examines monthly mortality dynamics in relation to predictions from a spatial SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model of infection introduced by Bisin and Moro (2020). The analysis indicates that during the peak months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a larger non-white population and higher social deprivation in an area were associated with higher excess mortality, particularly among men. Regarding dynamics, higher population density accelerated the growth in mortality during the upsurge in infection and increased its rate of decline after the peak of the epidemic, thereby producing a more peaked mortality profile. There is also evidence of a slower post-peak decline in mortality in more socially deprived areas but a more rapid decline in areas with a larger non-white population.","Breen, R.; Ermisch, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20188003v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20188003v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
3,Trend prediction of COVID-19 based on ARIMA model in mainland of China,"Abstract: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has aroused widespread concern around the world and poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. In this paper, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in mainland of China. We collected the cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, and cumulative recovery in mainland of China from January 20 to June 30, 2020, and divided the data into experimental group and test group. The ARIMA model was fitted with the experimental group data, and the optimal model was selected for prediction analysis. The predicted data were compared with the test group. The average relative errors of actual cumulative cases, deaths, recovery and predicted values in each province are between -22.32%-22.66%, -9.52%-0.08%, -8.84%-1.16, the results of the comprehensive experimental group and test group show The error of fitting and prediction is small, the degree of fitting is good, the model supports and is suitable for the prediction of the epidemic situation, which has practical guiding significance for the prevention and control of the epidemic situation.","Chuqiao, H.; xifeng, J.; jianghua, z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188235v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188235v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
4,Inference of SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding neutralizing antibody titers in sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients by using commercial enzyme and chemiluminescent immunoassays,"Background: Whether antibody levels measured by commercially-available enzyme or chemiluminescent immunoassays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein can act as a proxy for serum neutralizing activity remains to be established for many of these assays. Objectives: To evaluate the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. Results: Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay ({kappa}, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho=0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (Rho=0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays. Conclusions: the suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.","Valdivia, A.; Torres, I.; Latorre, V.; Frances-Gomez, C.; Albert, E.; Gozalbo, R.; Alcaraz, M.

5,Lack of protective effect of chloroquine derivatives on COVID-19 disease in a Spanish sample of chronically treated patients,"Background: The search for a SARS-CoV-2 treatment has emerged as a worldwide priority. We evaluated the role of chloroquine and its derivatives in COVID-19 in Spanish individuals. Methods: We performed a survey addressed to patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives for the control of their autoimmune diseases. The survey was distributed with special attention to Spanish patient associations centred on autoimmune diseases and rheumatology and to the general population. A sample of untreated subjects was matched to the treated group according to sex, age range and incidence region. COVID-19 disease prevalence was compared between treated and untreated-matched control sample. Results: A total of 319 surveys of patients regularly taking chloroquine and its derivatives were recovered for further analysis. The prevalence of declared COVID-19 status in the treated group was 5.3% and the mean prevalence among the untreated-matched groups was 3.4%. A community exposition to COVID-19 was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 in both, treated (17.0% vs. 3.2%; p-value<0.001) and untreated groups (13.4% vs. 1.1%; p-value=0.027). Conclusion: We did not find differences of reported COVID-19 cases between treated and untreated groups, indicating a lack of protection by regular administration of chloroquine and its derivative drugs on COVID-19 infection. Of relevance, data indicates that patients that regularly take chloroquine derivatives are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection and must take the same protection measures as the general population.","Laplana, M.; Yuguero, O.; Fibla, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20158121v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20158121v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
6,Performance and Robustness of Machine Learning-based Radiomic COVID-19 Severity Prediction,"Objectives: This study investigated the performance and robustness of radiomics in predicting COVID-19 severity in a large public cohort. Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01). For radiologist classification, the predictive power of the model increased to AUC_valid^radiologist=0.66 (p<<0.01) as the number of features grew from 1 to 5. Cross-validation yielded AUC_valid^radiologist=0.63 (p=0.002) and AUC_valid^provider=0.60 (p=0.09). Conclusions: Radiomics significantly predicted different levels of COVID-19 severity. The prediction was moderately sensitive to inter-observer classifications, and thus need to be used with caution.","Yip, S. S.

7,On the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging of COVID-19,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, lung imaging takes a key role in addressing the magnified need of speed, cost, ubiquity and precision in medical care. The rise of artificial intelligence induced a quantum leap in medical imaging: AI has now proven equipollent to healthcare professionals in several diseases and the potential to save time, cost and increase coverage. But AI-accelerated medical imaging must still fully demonstrate its ability in remediating diseases such as COVID-19. We identify key use cases of lung imaging for COVID-19, comparing CT, X-Ray and ultrasound imaging from clinical and AI perspectives. We perform a systematic, manual survey of 197 related publications that reveals a disparity in the focus of the AI and clinical communities, caused by data availability and the lack of collaboration, and in modality trends, driven by ubiquity. Last, challenges in AI-acceleration and ways to remediate them are discussed and future research goals are identified.","Born, J.; Beymer, D.; Rajan, D.; Coy, A.; Mukherjee, V.

8,COVID-19 transmission in a university setting: a rapid review of modelling studies,"Managing COVID-19 within a university setting presents unique challenges. At the start of term, students arrive from geographically diverse locations and potentially have higher numbers of social contacts than the general population, particularly if living in university halls of residence accommodation. Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding the potential spread of infection and are being actively used to inform policy about the management of COVID-19. Our aim was to provide a rapid review and appraisal of the literature on mathematical models investigating COVID-19 infection in a university setting. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, bioRxiv/ medRxiv and sought expert input via social media to identify relevant papers. BioRxiv/ medRxiv and PubMed/Web of Science searches took place on 3 and 6 July 2020, respectively. Papers were restricted to English language. Screening of peer-reviewed and pre-print papers and contact with experts yielded five relevant papers - all of which were pre-prints. All models suggest a significant potential for transmission of COVID-19 in universities. Testing of symptomatic persons and screening of the university community regardless of symptoms, combined with isolation of infected individuals and effective contact tracing were critical for infection control in the absence of other mitigation interventions. When other mitigation interventions were considered (such as moving teaching online, social/physical distancing, and the use of face coverings) the additional value of screening for infection control was limited. Multiple interventions will be needed to control infection spread within the university setting and the interaction with the wider community is an important consideration. Isolation of identified cases and quarantine of contacts is likely to lead to large numbers of students requiring educational, psychological and behavioural support and will likely have a large impact on the attendance of students (and staff), necessitating online options for teaching, even where in-person classes are taking place. Models were highly sensitive to assumptions in the parameters, including the number and type of individuals contacts, number of contacts traced, frequency of screening and delays in testing. Future models could aid policy decisions by considering the incremental benefit of multiple interventions and using empirical data on mixing within the university community and with the wider community where available. Universities will need to be able to adapt quickly to the evolving situation locally to support the health and wellbeing of the university and wider communities.","Christensen, H.; Turner, K.; Trickey, A.; Booton, R.

9,The impact of work loss on mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a prospective cohort study,"Objective: To determine if losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health. To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Design: Baseline data from a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting: Australia, 27th March to 12th June 2020. Participants: Australians aged 18+ years, employed in a paid job prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey. Main Outcome Measures: Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress. Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score <= 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results: 2,603 respondents including groups who had lost their job (N=541), were not working but remained employed (N=613), were working less (N=789) and whose work was unaffected (N=789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR=2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR=1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR=2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR=5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR=1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR=1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion: Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources. Responses that increase financial security and enhance social connections may partially alleviate the health impacts of work loss.","Griffiths, D.; Sheehan, L.; Van Vreden, C.; Petrie, D.; Grant, G.; Whiteford, P.; Sim, M.; Collie, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189514v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189514v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
10,Healthcare workers in elderly care: a source of silent SARS-CoV-2 transmission?,"Importance: Healthcare workers (HCWs), including those with mild symptoms, may be an important source of COVID-19 within elderly care. Objective: To gain insight into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs working in elderly care settings. Design: Cross-sectional study among HCWs working in elderly care in the South-East of the Netherlands, testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 31 and April 17, 2020. Setting: HCWs working in geriatric rehabilitation, somatic and psychogeriatric wards or small-scale living groups and district nursing, with a total of 5245 HCWs within 4 organisations. Participants: 621 HCWs with mild respiratory symptoms. Main Outcomes: Number of HCWs testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swabs, using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, N-gene, and RdRP. HCWs filled out a survey to collect information on symptoms and possible sources of infection. Results: 133/615 (21.6%) HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 15.6 to 44.4% per elderly care organisation, and from 0 to 64.3% per separate location of the organizations, respectively. 74.6% of tested HCWs were nursing staff, 1.7% elderly care physicians, 20.3% other HCWs with patient contact and 3.4% HCWs without patient contact. In the univariate analysis, fever, runny or stuffy nose, anosmia, general malaise, myalgia, headache and ocular pain were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while gastro-intestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms, other than runny or stuffy nose were not. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity were contact with patients or colleagues with suspected or proven COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing of 22 samples in 2 facilities strongly suggests spread within facilities. Conclusions and Relevance: We found a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs in nursing homes and district nursing, supporting the hypothesis of undetected spread within elderly care facilities. Structural testing of elderly care HCWs, including track and trace of contacts, should be performed to control this spread, even when only mild symptoms are present.","Dautzenberg, M. J.

11,COVID-19 control across urban-rural gradients,"Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","Wells, K.; Lurgi, M.; Collins, B.; Lucini, B.; Kao, R.

12,Age-structured SIR model and resource growth dynamics: A preliminary COVID-19 study,"In this paper, we discuss three different response strategies to a disease outbreak and their economic implications in an age-structured population. We have utilized the classical age structured SIR-model, thus assuming that recovered people will not be infected again. Available resource dynamics is governed by the well-known logistic growth model, in which the reproduction coefficient depends on the disease outbreak spreading dynamics. We further investigate the feedback interaction of the disease spread dynamics and resource growth dynamics with the premise that the quality of treatment depends on the current economic situation. The very inclusion of mortality rates and economic considerations in the same model may be incongruous under certain positions, but in this model, we take a 'realpolitik' approach by exploring all of these factors together as it is done in reality.","Babajanyan, S.

13,Effectiveness of digital interventions to improve household and community infection prevention and control behaviours and to reduce incidence of respiratory and/or gastro-intestinal infections: A rapid systematic review,"Background Digital interventions have potential to efficiently support improved hygiene practices to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the evidence for digital interventions to improve hygiene practices within the community. Methods We reviewed articles published between 01 January 2000 and 26 May 2019 that presented a controlled trial of a digital intervention to improve hygiene behaviours in the community. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure and grey literature. Trials in hospitals were excluded, as were trials aiming at prevention of sexually transmitted infections; only target diseases with transmission mechanisms similar to COVID-19 (e.g. respiratory and gastrointestinal infections) were included. Trials had to evaluate a uniquely digital component of an intervention. Study designs were limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series analyses. Outcomes could be either incidence of infections or change in hygiene behaviours. The Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess study quality. Results We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported successfully improving self-reported hygiene behaviour or health outcomes, but only one of these six trials confirmed improvements using objective measures (reduced consultations and antibiotic prescriptions), Germ Defence. Settings included kindergartens, workplaces, and service station restrooms. Modes of delivery were diverse: WeChat, website, text messages, audio messages to mobiles, electronic billboards, and electronic personal care records. Four interventions targeted parents of young children with educational materials. Two targeted the general population; these also used behaviour change techniques or theory to inform the intervention. Only one trial had low risk of bias, Germ Defence; the most common concerns were lack of information about the randomisation, possible bias in reporting of behavioural outcomes, and lack of an analysis plan and possible selective reporting of results. Conclusion There was only one intervention that was judged to be at low risk of bias, Germ Defence, which reduced incidence and severity of illness, as confirmed by objective measures. Further evaluation is required to determine the effectiveness of the other interventions reviewed.","Gold, N.; Hu, X.-Y.; Denford, S.; Xia, R.-Y.; Towler, L.; Groot, J.; Gledhill, R.; Willcox, M.; Ainsworth, B.; Miller, S.; Moore, M.; Little, P.; Amlot, R.; Chadborn, T.; Yardley, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20164947v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20164947v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
14,Hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study,"Background. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received [&ge;]2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33).

15,Ongoing natural selection drives the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new RNA virus affecting humans and spreads extensively through world populations since its first outbreak in late December, 2019. Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is actively evolving, and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown. Understanding the evolutionary mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 is essential for predicting the epidemic trend, and providing guidance for disease control and treatments. Interrogating 22,078 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries, we demonstrate with convincing evidence that (i) SARS-CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection. (ii) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes. Notably, genes related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense are under adaptive evolution while genes related to viral RNA replication, transcription and translation are under purifying selection. A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters, of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted.","Liu, Q.; Zhao, S.; Hou, Y.; Zhao, W.; Bao, Y.; Xue, Y.; Chen, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189860v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189860v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
16,Mitigation Strategies and Compliance in the Covid-19 Fight; How Much Compliance is Enough?,"Today, with only 4% of the world's population, the U.S. is bearing a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections. Seeking to understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Drilling down to the state level, we create specific state indices suitable for the U.S. to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. In this, we build on the Oxford Stringency Index. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator to reduce the transmission, is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states. These are New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one; this is the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. States successful in combating the pandemic were able to achieve a suitable combination. Understanding of this relationship by the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options.","Mukerjee, S.; Chow, C.; Li, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189449v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189449v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
17,"COMBINATION OF TOCILIZUMAB AND STEROIDS TO IMPROVE MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 INFECTION: A SPANISH, MULTICENTER, COHORT STUDY","Background: We aimed to determine the impact of tocilizumab use in severe COVID-19 pneumonia mortality. Methods: We performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary hospitals in Spain, from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by Inverse Probability of the Treatment Weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab effect in patients receiving steroids during the 48h following inclusion was analyzed. Results: During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days (IQR 8-14). Global mortality was 23.7%. Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls (16.8% versus 31.5%, HR 0.514 [95CI 0.355-0.744], p<0.001; weighted HR 0.741 [95CI 0.619-0.887], p=0.001). Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment (RRR 46.7%). We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone (10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 [95CI 0.352-0.741], p=0.036; weighted HR 0.6 [95CI 0.449-0.804], p<0.001) (Interaction p=0.094). Conclusions: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in patients treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated, and that tocilizumab effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated cases with COVID-19 during the first 48 hours of presenting with respiratory failure despite of oxygen therapy.

18,Gastrointestinal involvement attenuates COVID-19 severity and mortality,"Given that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated the impact of GI infection on disease pathogenesis in three large cohorts of patients in the United States and Europe. Unexpectedly, we observed that GI involvement was associated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality, with an accompanying reduction in key inflammatory proteins including IL-6, CXCL8, IL-17A and CCL28 in circulation. In a fourth cohort of COVID-19 patients in which GI biopsies were obtained, we identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) within small intestinal enterocytes for the first time in vivo but failed to obtain culturable virus. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues confirmed low levels of cellular inflammation in the GI lamina propria and an active downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B among others. These data draw attention to organ-level heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and highlight the role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation with related mortality benefit.","Livanos, A.

19,Network for subclinical prognostication of COVID 19 Patients from data of thoracic roentgenogram: A feasible alternative screening technology,"Background and Study Aim: COVID 19 is the terminology driving peoples life in the year 2020 without a supportive globally high mortality rate. Coronavirus lead pandemic is a new found disease with no gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic guideline across the globe. Amidst this scenario our aim is to develop a prediction model that makes mass screening easy on par with reducing strain on hospitals diagnostic facility and doctors alike. For this prediction model, a neural network based on Chest X-ray images has been developed. Alongside the aim is also to generate a case record form that would include prediction model result along with few other subclinical factors for generating disease identification. Once found positive then only it will proceed to RT-PCR for final validation. The objective was to provide a cheap alternative to RT-PCR for mass screening and to reduced burden on diagnostic facility by keeping RT-PCR only for final confirmation. Methods: Datasets of chest X-ray images gathered from across the globe has been used to test and train the network after proper dataset curing and augmentation. Results: The final neural network-based prediction model showed an accuracy of 81% with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 90%. The AUC score obtained is 93.7%. Discussion and Conclusion: The above results based on the existing datasets showcase our model capability to successfully distinguish patients based on Chest X-ray (a non-invasive tool) and along with the designed case record form it can significantly contribute in increasing hospitals monitoring and health care capability.","Bararia, A.; Ghosh, A.; Bose, C.; Bhar, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189852v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189852v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
20,Frequency and accuracy of proactive testing for COVID-19,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has proven difficult to control not only because of its high transmissibility, but because those who are infected readily spread the virus before symptoms appear, and because some infected individuals, though contagious, never exhibit symptoms. Proactive testing of asymptomatic individuals is therefore a powerful, and probably necessary, tool for preventing widespread infection in many settings. This paper explores the effectiveness of alternative testing regimes, in which the frequency, the accuracy, and the delay between testing and results determine the time path of infection. For a simple model of disease transmission, we present analytic formulas that determine the effect of testing on the expected number of days of during which an infectious individual is exposed to the population at large. This allows us to estimate the frequency of testing that would be required to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks, and to explore the trade-offs between frequency, accuracy, and delay in achieving this objective. We conclude by discussing applications to outbreak control on college and university campuses.","Bergstrom, T.; Bergstrom, C.

21,"Relationships of total COVID-19 cases and deaths with ten demographic, economic and social indicators","We have used data for 45 countries with a population of over 30 millions in which 85.8% of the world's population lives. The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in these countries with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators (indices) were studied. These indicators are Life Expectancy, Median Age, Growth Rate, Population Density, GDP PPP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), Gini index of income equality, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Democracy Index. Statistically significant relationships were found with all indicators excluding Gini index and Population Density. We have found that the closest is the relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population with correlation coefficient R = 0.926. Therefore, it is clear statistically that the more are Cases per million in a country the more are Deaths per million. This confirms the correctness of the timely and effective introduction of the necessary pandemic restrictions in the countries. It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. This paradoxical results show that the richest and well-being countries are most seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most probable reason for this is the large percentage of aging population, comorbidity of population with severe chronic diseases and obesity in countries with high GDP and HDI. No less important reason appears the delayed and/or insufficiently effective pandemic restrictions in these countries, which have underestimated the danger of a pandemic in early stage. Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The countries that deviates the most from the regression lines were shown. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Student's t-test was p <0.0001. The countries that deviate the most from both sides of the regression line were shown. It has been shown that the correlations of COVID-19 cases and Deaths with the studied indicators decrease with time.

22,Quantifying Inaccuracies in Modeling COVID-19 Pandemic within a Continuous Time Picture,"Typically, mathematical simulation studies on COVID-19 pandemic forecasting are based on deterministic differential equations which assume that both the number (n) of individuals in various epidemiological classes and the time (t) on which they depend are quantities that vary continuous. This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position Tc1/2 obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position Td1/2 predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift {tau} {equiv} Tc1/2 - Td1/2 < 0 is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate {kappa}. For a broad range of {kappa} values deduced from COVID-19 data at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a rather robust estimate {tau} {approx} -2.65 day-1. Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real system.","Baldea, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188755v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188755v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
23,Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Coronavirus Diseases 2019 Patients with Different Severity,"Background: More understanding of antibody responses in the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is useful for vaccine development. Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG among COVID-19 Thai patients with different severity. Methods: We used plasma from 118 adult patients who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 49 patients under investigation without infection, 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Euroimmun. The optical density ratio cut off for positive test was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. The association of antibody response with the severity of diseases and the day of symptoms was performed. Results: From Mar 10 to May 31, 2020, 289 participants were enrolled, and 384 samples were analyzed. Patients were categorized by clinical manifestations to mild (n=59), moderate (n=27) and severe (n=32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from samples collected after day 7 is 87.9% (95% CI 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.2-91.3), respectively. The severe group had a significantly higher level of specific IgA and IgG to S1 antigen compared to the mild group. All moderate to severe patients have specific IgG while 20% of the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males compared to females among the severe group (p=0.003). Conclusion: The serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 has high sensitivity after the second week after onset of illness. Serological response differs among patients with different severity and different sex.","Kowitdamrong, E.; Puthanakit, T.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Prompetchara, E.; Suchartlikitwong, P.; Putcharoen, O.; Hirankarn, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189480v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189480v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
24,Ethnicity and clinical outcomes in COVID-19A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Importance The association of ethnicity with outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is unclear. Objective To determine whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality are associated with ethnicity. Data Sources We searched all English language articles published 1st December 2019 - 30th June 2020 within MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library using indexing terms for COVID-19 and ethnicity, as well as manuscripts awaiting peer review on MedRxiv during the same period. Study Selection Included studies reported original clinical data, disaggregated by ethnicity, on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We excluded correspondence, area level, modelling and basic science articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion. Of 926 identified articles, 35 were included in the meta-analyses. Data Extraction and Synthesis The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data using a piloted form on: (1) rates of infection, ICU admission and mortality by ethnicity; and (2) unadjusted and adjusted data comparing ethnic minority and White groups. Data were pooled using random effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were: (1) infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on molecular testing; (2) ICU admission; and (3) mortality in COVID-19 confirmed and suspected cases. Results 13,535,562 patients from 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Black, Asian and Hispanic individuals had a greater risk of infection compared to White individuals (Black: pooled adjusted RR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.59-2.67; Asian: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59; Hispanic: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.39-2.25). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be admitted to ICU than White individuals (pooled adjusted RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55). Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. Conclusions Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnic groups are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Black individuals may be more likely to require ICU admission for COVID-19. There may also be disparities in risk of death from COVID-19 at a population level. Our findings are of critical public health importance and should inform policy on minimising SARS-CoV-2 exposure in ethnic minority groups.","Sze, S.; Pan, D.; Gray, L. J.; Nevill, C. R.; Martin, C.

The interaction of viral Spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to show that ACE2 orthologs from 24, 21, and 16 of 46 phylogenetically diverse bat species, including those in close and distant contact with humans, do not support entry of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and both of these coronaviruses, respectively. Furthermore, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify genetic changes in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our study demonstrates that many, if not most, bat species are not potential hosts of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and provides important insights into pandemic control and wildlife conservation.","Yan, H.; Jiao, H.; Liu, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, X.; Guo, M.; Wang, B.-J.; Lan, K.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
27,Interaction of human ACE2 to membrane-bound SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins,"A novel severe acute respiratory (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, S. P.; Chen, Y.; Prevost, J.; Gasser, R.; Beaudoin-Bussieres, G.; Abrams, C.

28,Kynurenic acid underlies sex-specific immune responses to COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has poorer clinical outcomes in males compared to females, and immune responses underlie these sex-related differences in disease trajectory. As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID- 19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.","Cai, Y.; Kim, D. J.; Takahashi, T.; Broadhurst, D. I.; Ma, S.; Rattray, N. J.

29,In vitro study of BromAc on SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins shows synergy and disintegration at modest concentrations,"Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. It is characterised by being highly contagious and nasal mucosa appears to be the primary site with subsequent spread to the lungs and elsewhere. BromAc (Bromelain & Acetylcysteine) has been described to disrupt glycoproteins by the synchronous breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulphide bonds. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target as it is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells and is formed of glycoprotein and disulphide bridges for stabilisation. Hence, we sought to determine whether BromAc has activity on the spike and envelope protein specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Design: Gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out on recombinant spike and envelope proteins that were treated with a range of concentrations of single agents and BromAc. For UV analysis of disulfide bonds reduction, both spike and envelope protein were treated with Acetylcysteine with the determination of loss of disulfide bonds. Results: Recombinant spike and envelope SARS-CoV-2 protein were fragmented by BromAc whilst single agents had minimal effect. Spike and envelope proteins disulphide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine. Conclusion: BromAc disintegrates the spike and envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2 and may render it non-infective. In vitro tests on live virus have been encouraging and clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent.","Akhter, J.; Pillai, K.; Badar, S.; Mekkawy, A.; Valle, S.; Morris, D.

30,"Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein correlates with, but does not predict neutralization","Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA and neutralization assays we observed a strong correlation between these two parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of viral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlights the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, S.; Laumaea, A.; Gasser, R.; Medjahed, H.; Pancera, M.; Stamatatos, L.; McGuire, A.; Bazin, R.; Finzi, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
31,A prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and prevents lung infection in non-human primates,"To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine against the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD up, two-RBD down state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFNy+ CD8+ T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge. BNT162b2 is currently being evaluated in a global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04368728).","Vogel, A.; Kanevsky, I.; Che, Y.; Swanson, K.; Muik, A.; Vormehr, M.; Kranz, L.; Walzer, K.; Hein, S.; Gueler, A.; Loschko, J.; Maddur, M.; Tompkins, K.; Cole, J.; Lui, B.

32,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Africa reveals potentially clinically relevant mutations.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan province of the Hubei district in China and rapidly spread across the globe. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. Across the continents and specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel related. Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with sequences from COVID-19 hotspots (including China, Brazil, Italy, United State of America and the United Kingdom). To identify if there are distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to genomes from other countries, including disease hotspots, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase (NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible targets for vaccine coverage or potential therapeutic agents. Our results showed a similarity between the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes and genomes in countries including China, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and the United States of America. This study shows for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 landscape across Africa and will potentially provide insights into specific mutations to relevant proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in African populations.","Iweriebor, B.

33,Development and Validation of the Patient History COVID-19 (PH-Covid19) Scoring System: A Multivariable Prediction Model of Death in Mexican Patients with COVID-19,"We sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors. We conducted a national retrospective cohort in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. To develop the model, we included 264,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 28 and May 30, 2020. To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","Mancilla-Galindo, J.; Vera-Zertuche, J.

34,Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases,"A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections. To quantify this phenomenon requires the analysis of the effect of the variance and higher moments of the infection distribution. Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples.We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number R0 is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Safra, S.; Oz, Y.; Rubinstein, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189258v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189258v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
35,Covid 19 and orthopaedic surgery in a large trauma centre in India,"Background - We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by the novel SARS-Cov-2 virus. A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods - A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results - In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT -PCR swab test for COVID - 19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT -PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post - operatively. Conclusions - Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative. All precautions must be taken while performing emergency surgeries. Our algorithm in managing patients has proven to be effective and can be replicated with ease to continue operating and taking care of orthopaedic patients during this pandemic.","Kumar, K.

36,Modelling the transmission of infectious diseases inside hospital bays: implications for Covid-19,"Healthcare associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-Covid-19 patients in many hospitals across UK. We use this mathematical model to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-Covid bays, in the context of various scenarios: changes in the number of contacts with infected patients and staff, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (Covid-only) hospital bays.","Moreno Martos, D.; Parcell, B.; Eftimie, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188110v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188110v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
37,Structural characterization of Nonstructural protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus and the etiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 A. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped {beta}-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein. Our results provide unparalleled insight into the molecular structure of a major pathogenic determinant of SARS-CoV-2.","Semper, C.; Watanabe, N.; Savchenko, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
38,"The impact of mobility restriction measures on the reproduction index of Covid-19 in the city of Queretaro, Mexico","An observational study based on official data (CONACYT and Ministry of Health) was carried out in which the effective reproduction index R(e) and the reproduction index R0 are compared with the mobility presented by Google. Additionally, an overview of the development of the pandemic in Queretaro, Mexico. Highlights key events; such as the main government interventions and social factors that could affect the society behavior. A positive relationship is observed between Re, R0, and the levels of mobility presented by Google. This indicates that an increase in mobility is associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In February, a significant decrease in mobility is observed, which lasts until approximately May 1st. This period corresponds to an R0 and R(e) between 1.17 and 1.87. After May 1st, there is a sustained increase in mobility levels. And, as of May 16, the effective reproduction index R (e) and the reproduction index R0 begin to increase. This is expected as it reflects the delay between the infection and the diagnosis of COVID-19. The R0 and R (e) increase from 1.45 on May 16 to 3.59 on July 5. According to the baseline of normal mobility levels, an increase from -49.6% on May 1st, to -20.6% on July 5 was observed. Based on these data, we conclude that the relaxation of restrictive mobility measures should be reconsidered. Despite this, mobility restrictions must not be a unique mitigation strategy for controlling the Reproductive Index. A comprehensive approach is needed, which generates socio-behavioral changes that allow a further reduction in reproductive rates.","San Roman Orozco, O.; Agraz Orozco, S.; Gutierrez Alvarez, I.

39,Activin/Follistatin-axis deregulation is independently associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality,"Rationale: Activins are inflammatory and tissue-repair-related members of the TGF{beta}-superfamily that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several immuno-inflammatory disorders including sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that they might be of particular relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Objectives: To assess the involvement of the Activin-Follistatin-axis in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: Levels of Activins -A, -B and their physiological inhibitor Follistatin, were retrospectively analyzed in 314 serum samples from 117 COVID-19 patients derived from two independent centers and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model. Main Results: The Activin/Follistatin-axis was significantly deregulated during the course of COVID-19 and was independently associated with severity and in-hospital mortality. FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel disease scoring system, adding one point for each of Follistatin >6235 pg/ml, Activin-A >591 pg/ml, Activin-B >249 pg/ml, CRP >10.3 mg/dL, LDH >427 U/L, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte-Ratio >5.6, Years of Age >61, Comorbidities >1 and D-dimers >1097 ng/ml, efficiently predicted and monitored fatal outcome independently of multiplicity and timing of sampling (AUC: 0.951{+/-}0.032, p<10-6). Validation in 35 samples derived from a third hospital indicated comparable AUC (0.958{+/-}0.086, p=0.032). Conclusion: This study unravels the link between Activin/Folistatin-axis and COVID-19 mortality and introduces FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel pathophysiology-based tool that copes with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of COCVID-19, predicts disease outcome and supports clinical decision making.

40,"In severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 induces a chronic, TGF-β-dominated adaptive immune response","The human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly variable, with less than 10% of infections resulting in severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Here we have analyzed the dynamics of the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 ICU patients at the level of single cell transcriptomes and B cell and T cell receptor (BCR, TCR) repertoires. Early after ICU admission, before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, patients generate activated peripheral B cells with a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature. After seroconversion, patients display circulating activated B cells expressing an IL-21-induced gene expression signature and mainly IgG1 and IgA1, two isotypes induced by IL-21 and TGF-{beta}, respectively. In sustained COVID-19, the persistent immune reaction is shifted to IgA2-expressing activated peripheral B cells, displaying somatic hypermutation, and expressing TGF-{beta}-induced signature genes, like IgA germline transcripts. The switch from an IgG1 to an IgA2-dominated B cell response correlates with the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 reactive follicular T helper cells expressing IL-21 and/or TGF-{beta} in the blood. Despite the continued presence of IgA2-expressing B cells and IgA antibodies in the blood of progressed COVID-19 patients, IgA2 secreting cells were scarce in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients. In summary, in severely affected COVID-19 patients SARS-CoV-2 triggers chronic immune reactions which are controlled by TGF-{beta}, with most of the activated B cells being no longer specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor binding domain, nor for nucleoprotein. TGF-{beta} may candidate as a target to ameliorate detrimental immunopathology in those patients.","Ferreira-Gomes, M.; Kruglov, A.; Durek, P.; Heinrich, F.; Tizian, C.; Heinz, G.

This study aimed to examine the characteristic of repositive COVID-19 cases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to August 17, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of RNA repositive among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 37 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 2,436 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) patients was repositive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up.

42,Beneficial and Harmful Outcomes of Tocilizumab in Severe COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Pending for randomized control trials, the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 is based on observational studies and remains controversial. Purpose: To summarize evidence about the effect of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases from 1 January to 21 August 2020. Study Selection: Observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Data Extraction: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. Data synthesis: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 were controlled and 30 were not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group vs. the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). The overall NNT to avoid one death was 20. In hospital wards, patients in the TCZ-group were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion than those in the control group; however, ICU mortality of the TCZ-group was lower than in the control group. Secondary infections occurred in a higher proportion in TCZ-treated patients. Among survivors, the length of stay was similar in both groups. Limitations: Conclusions should be considered as weak evidence since they are based on observational studies, most of them retrospective. A variety of factors influencing the indication and effect of TCZ could not be evaluated in-depth. Conclusions: TCZ to seem beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Conversely, patients receiving TCZ appear to be at higher risk for secondary infections, especially those admitted to ICU.","Rubio-Rivas, M.; Mora-Lujan, J. M.; Montero, A.; Homs, N.

Persistent patterns are observed between disease outcome and social inequality, linking poor living conditions to a faster spread, an elderly populace to a slower spread, and both a college education and the presence of medical facilities to low fatality rates.","Dibyachintan, S.; Nandy, P.; Das, K.; Vinjanampathy, S.; Mitra, M.

45,Multiscale statistical physics of the Human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome,"Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID--19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","Ghavasieh, A.; Bontorin, S.; Artime, O.; De Domenico, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
46,Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in India: An open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial (PLACID Trial),"Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases. We investigated its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19. Design: Open-label, parallel-arm, phase II, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-nine public and private hospitals across India. Participants: Hospitalized, moderately ill confirmed COVID-19 patients (PaO2/FiO2: 200-300 or respiratory rate > 24/min and SpO2 [&le;] 93% on room air). Intervention: Participants were randomized to either control (best standard of care (BSC)) or intervention (CP + BSC) arm. Two doses of 200 mL CP was transfused 24 hours apart in the intervention arm. Main Outcome Measure: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2<100) or all-cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. Results: Between 22 nd April to 14 th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44 (18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (13.6%) and 31 (14.6%) participants in intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: -0.61 to 1.83]. Interpretation: CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.","Agarwal, A.; Mukherjee, A.; Kumar, G.; Chatterjee, P.; Bhatnagar, T.; Malhotra, P.; Latha, B.; Bundas, S.; Kumar, V.; Dosi, R.; Khambholja, J.

47,The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates early serine protease-mediated entry into organoid-derived human airway cells,"After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a second zoonotic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, emerged late 2019 in China and rapidly caused the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a public health crisis of an unprecedented scale. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target.

Significance StatementHighly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate fundamental knowledge to the clinic, a process that is expedited through the use of relevant cell culture systems.","Mykytyn, A.

48,Transmission of allosteric response within the homotrimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike upon recognition of ACE2 receptor by the receptor-binding domain,"The pathogenesis of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates through recognition of ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located at spikes of the virus. Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action of the trimer. Based on our results, we propose the allosteric loop of RBD as a potential drug target.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Bhattacharyya, R.; Sengupta, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,False
49,Mutational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in African Population,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious and pathogenic virus has claimed lot of lives globally since its outbreak in December 2019 posing dire threat on public health, global economy, social and human interaction. At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","Omotoso, O.

50,"Health professionals practice and associated factors towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 pandemic in public health facilities of Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","Abstract Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease. Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association was declared at P<0.05. Results In this study, 35{middle dot}3% (95%CI: 30{middle dot}7%, 39{middle dot}8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68{middle dot}9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67{middle dot}3%), and use facemask in crowds (56{middle dot}8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR=1{middle dot}84, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR=2{middle dot}02, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}02, 3{middle dot}18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 were factors showed signification association with the practice. Conclusions The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery.","Mersha, A.; Shibiru, S.; Girma, M.; Ayele, G.; Bante, A.; Kassa, M.; Abebe, S.; Shewangizaw, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
51,The dichotomous and incomplete adaptive immunity in COVID-19,"The adaptive immunity that protects patients from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is not well characterized. In particular, the asymptomatic patients have been found to induce weak and transient SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; meanwhile, the protective immunity that guide the recovery of these asymptomatic patients is also not well studied. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 49 patients with other disease severity (mild, n=10, moderate, n=32, severe, n=7) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and long-term humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients. These results therefore uncovered the protective immunity in asymptomatic patients and revealed the strikingly dichotomous and unbalanced humoral and cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, providing important insights into rational design of COVID-19 vaccines.","Gao, L.; Zhou, J.; Yang, S.; Chen, X.; Yang, Y.; Li, R.; Pan, Z.; Zhao, J.; Li, Z.; Huang, Q.; Tang, J.; Hu, L.; Liu, P.; Zhang, G.; Chen, Y.; Ye, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20187435v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
52,The association between COVID-19 and preterm delivery: A cohort study with a multivariate analysis,"Structured abstract Objective: To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2, the cause of COVID 19 disease) exposure in pregnancy, compared to non exposure, is associated with infection related obstetric morbidity. Design and setting: Throughout Spain, 45 hospitals took part in the universal screening of pregnant women going into labour using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID 19 since late March 2020. Methods: The cohort of exposed and unexposed pregnancies was followed up until 6 weeks postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of COVID 19 exposure, compared to non exposure, with infection related obstetric outcomes. Main outcome measures: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Results: In the cohort of 1,009 screened pregnancies, 246 were COVID 19 positive. Compared to non exposure, COVID 19 exposure increased the odds of preterm birth (34 vs 51, 13.8% vs 6.7%, aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.32 3.36, p=0.002), premature rupture of membranes at term (39 vs 75, % vs 9.8%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11 2.57, p=0.013) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (23 vs 18, 9.3% vs 2.4%, aOR 4.62, 95% CI 2.43 8.94, p<0.001). Conclusion: This first prospective cohort study demonstrated that pregnant women infected with SARS CoV 2 have more infection related obstetric morbidity.

53,The timing of COVID-19 transmission,"The timing of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is a critical factor to understand the epidemic trajectory and the impact of isolation, contact tracing and other non- pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 epidemics. We examined the distribution of transmission events with respect to exposure and onset of symptoms. We show that for symptomatic individuals, the timing of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is more strongly linked to the onset of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 than to the time since infection. We found that it was approximately centered and symmetric around the onset of symptoms, with three quarters of events occurring in the window from 2-3 days before to 2-3 days after. However, we caution against overinterpretation of the right tail of the distribution, due to its dependence on behavioural factors and interventions. We also found that the pre-symptomatic infectious period extended further back in time for individuals with longer incubation periods. This strongly suggests that information about when a case was infected should be collected where possible, in order to assess how far into the past their contacts should be traced. Overall, the fraction of transmission from strictly pre-symptomatic infections was high (41%; 95%CI 31-50%), which limits the efficacy of symptom-based interventions, and the large fraction of transmissions (35%; 95%CI 26-45%) that occur on the same day or the day after onset of symptoms underlines the critical importance of individuals distancing themselves from others as soon as they notice any symptoms, even if they are mild. Rapid or at-home testing and contextual risk information would greatly facilitate efficient early isolation.","Ferretti, L.; Ledda, A.; Wymant, C.; Zhao, L.; Ledda, V.; Abeler- Dorner, L.; Kendall, M.; Nurtay, A.; Cheng, H.-Y.; Ng, T.-C.; Lin, H.-H.; Hinch, R.; Masel, J.; Kilpatrick, A.

Here, we studied 159 hospitalized Italian patients with pneumonia from the NIAID-NCI COVID-19 Consortium using a phage-display method to characterize circulating antibodies binding to 93,904 viral peptides encoded by 1,276 strains of human viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a marked increase in individual's immune memory antibody repertoires linked to trajectories of disease severity from the longitudinal analysis also including anti-spike protein antibodies. By applying a machine-learning-based strategy, we developed a viral exposure signature predictive of COVID-19-related disease severity linked to patient survival.

55,Is climate a curse or a bless in the Covid-19 virus fighting?,"Faced with the global pandemic of Covid-19, we need to better understand the links between meteorological factors and the virus and investigate the existence of potential seasonal patterns. In the vein of a recent empirical literature, we reassess the impact of weather factors on Covid-19 daily cases in a panel of advanced and emerging countries between January the first and 28th May 2020. We consider 5 different meteorological factors and go further previous studies. In addition, we give a short-run and medium/long-run time perspective of the dramatic outcomes of the pandemic by both considering infected people (short-run) and fatalities (long-run). Our results reveal that the choice of delays and time perspective of the effects of climatic factors on the virus are crucial as well as Covid-19 outcomes can explain the discrepancies in the previous literature. For the first time, we use a dynamic panel model and consider two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: 1) direct/physical factors related to the survivals and durability dynamics of the virus in surfaces and outdoors and 2) an indirect factor through human behaviors and individual mobility - walking or driving outdoors - to capture the impact of climate on social distancing and thus on Covid-19 outcomes. Our model is estimated emph{per se} two different estimators and persistence, delays in patterns, nonlinearities and numerous specifications changes are taken into account with many robustness checks. Our work reveal that temperatures and, more interestingly, solar radiation - that has been clearly undervalued in previous studies - are significant climatic drivers on Covid-19 outbreak. Indirect effects through human behaviors ie interrelationships between climatic variables and people mobility are significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Since climate is per se purely exogenous, climate tend to strengthen the effect of mobility on virus spread. The net effect from climate on Covid-19 outbreak will thus result from the direct negative effect of climatic variables and from the indirect effect due to the interaction between mobility and them. Direct negative effects from climatic factors on Covid-19 outcomes - when they are significant - are partly compensated by positive indirect effects through human mobility. Suitable control policies should be implemented to control the mobility and social distancing. \","DAMETTE, O.; Mathonnat, C.; Goutte, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20182998v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20182998v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
56,Social capital and psychological distress during Colombian coronavirus disease lockdown,"Introduction. This study aims to establish the association between low capital social (CS) with some indicators of psychological distress. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, coronavirus disease perceived stress, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress was handed as dependent variables. Odds ratios (OR) were established with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using binary logistic regression analysis. Results. A group of 700 adults participated in the survey; they were aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13). Low SC was associated with depression risk (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95%CI 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.69-3.47). Conclusions. Low CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress represented in depression risk, elevated suicide risk, high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease and insomnia risk. SC is a community social resource that could help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disease quarantine amidst the Colombian population's psychological health. It is necessary to deepen the SC role in psychological well-being during and after the coronavirus disease epidemic.","Caballero-Dominguez, C.

57,Modeling COVID-19 dynamics in the sixteen West African countries,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused several damages to the world, especially in public health sector. This study considered a simple deterministic SIR (Susceptible- Infectious-Recovered) model to characterize and predict future course of the pandemic in the West African countries. We estimated specific characteristics of the disease's dynamics such as its initial conditions, reproduction numbers, true peak, reported peak with their corresponding times, final epidemic size and time-varying attack ratio. Our findings revealed a relatively low proportion of susceptible individuals in the region and in the different countries (1.2% across West Africa). The detection rate of the disease was also relatively low (0.9% for West Africa as a whole) and < 2% for most countries, except for Cape-Verde (9.5%), Mauritania (5.9%) and Ghana (4.4%). The reproduction number varied between 1.15 (Burkina-Faso) and 4.45 (Niger) and the peak time of the pandemic was between June and July for most countries. Most generally, the reported peak time came a week (7-8 days) after the true peak time. The model predicted 222,100 actual active cases in the region at peak time while the final epidemic size accounted for 0.6% of the West African population (2,526,700 individuals). Results obtained showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has not severely affected West Africa as noticed in other regions of the world, but current control measures and standard operating procedures should be maintained over time to ensure trends observed and even accelerate the declining trend of the pandemic.","Honfo, S.

58,COVID-19 superspreading in cities versus the countryside,"So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by an initial rapid rise in new cases followed by a peak and a more erratic behaviour that varies between regions. This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy. We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population.We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a largenumber of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
59,"Variations in state-level SARS-COV-2 testing recommendations in the United States, March-July 2020","Testing recommendations for COVID-19 in the United States have varied by state and over time in the spring and summer of 2020. As of July 2020, 16 states recommended testing asymptomatic members of the general public. The rate of COVID-19 tests reported in each state correlates with more permissive testing recommendations and with higher epidemic intensity. Higher per capita testing was associated with more complete reporting of COVID-19 deaths, which is a fundamental requirement for analyzing the pandemic. Coordinated, consistent guidelines for COVID-19 testing should be a high priority for state and national health systems.","Perniciaro, S. R.; Weinberger, D.

60,CAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS REOPEN FOR IN-PERSON CLASSES SAFELY AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC?,"Can educational institutions open up safely amid COVID-19? We build an epidemiological model to investigate the strategies necessary for institutions to reopen. The four measures that are most relevant for in-person opening are: (i) wide-spread rapid testing, possibly saliva-based, (ii) enforcement of mask wearing, (iii) social distancing, and (iv) contact tracing. We demonstrate that institutions need to test at a relatively high level (e.g., at least once every week) in the initial phases of reopening. Contact tracing is relatively more important when the positivity rate from random testing is relatively low, which is likely during the initial phases. A Bayesian adaptive testing strategy based on positivity rates can help institutions optimally manage the costs and risks of reopening. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for large-scale organizations. This work is motivated and guided by the SHIELD program of UIUC.","Mukherjee, U.

61,Pre-clinical studies of a recombinant adenoviral mucosal vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection,"There is an urgent need to develop efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that also address the issues of deployment, equitable access, and vaccine acceptance. Ideally, the vaccine would prevent virus infection and transmission as well as preventing COVID-19 disease. We previously developed an oral adenovirus-based vaccine technology that induces both mucosal and systemic immunity in humans. Here we investigate the immunogenicity of a range of candidate adenovirusbased vaccines, expressing full or partial sequences of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, in mice. We demonstrate that, compared to expression of the S1 domain or a stabilized spike antigen, the full length, wild-type spike antigen induces significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in the periphery and in the lungs, when the vaccine is administered mucosally. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by this leading vaccine candidate at low and high doses. This fulllength spike antigen plus nucleocapsid adenovirus construct has been prioritized for further clinical development.","Moore, A. C.; Dora, E. G.; Peinovich, N.; Tucker, K.

62,Genomic analysis reveals local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pandemic phase in Peru,"The dissemination of cases of the new SAR-COV-2 coronavirus represents a serious public health problem for Latin America and Peru. For this reason, it is important to characterize the genome of the isolates that circulate in Latin America. To characterize the complete genome of first samples of the virus circulating in Peru, we amplified seven overlapping segments of the viral genome by RT-PCR and sequenced using Miseq platform. The results indicate that the genomes of the Peruvian SARS-COV-2 samples belong to the genetic groups G and S. Likewise, a phylogenetic and MST analysis of the isolates confirm the introduction of multiple isolates from Europe and Asia that, after border closing, were transmitted locally in the capital and same regions of the country. These Peruvian samples (56%) grouped into two clusters inside G clade and share B.1.1.1 lineage. The characterization of these isolates must be considered for the use and design of diagnostic tools, and effective treatment and vaccine formulations.","Padilla Rojas, C.; Vega Chozo, K.; Galarza Perez, M.; Bailon Calderon, H.; Lope Pari, P.; Balbuena Torres, J.; Garcia Neyra, D.; Huaringa Nunez, M.; Rojas Serrano, N.; Caceres Rey, O.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.284604v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.284604v1?rss=1,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,,False
63,New insights into nCOVID-19 binding domain and its cellular receptors,"nCOVID-19 virus makes cellular entry using its spike protein protruding out on its surface. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as a receptor that mediates the viral entry by binding with the receptor binding motif of spike protein. In the present study, we elucidate the significance of N-terminal domain of spike protein in spike-receptor interactions. Recent clinical reports indicate a link between nCOVID-19 infections with patient comorbidities. The underlying reason behind this relationship is not clear. Using molecular docking, we study the affinity of the nCOVID-19 spike protein with cell receptors overexpressed under disease conditions. Our results suggest that certain cell receptors such as DC/L-SIGN, DPP4, IL22R and ephrin receptors could act as potential receptors for the spike protein. The receptor binding domain of nCOVID-19 is more flexible than that of SARS-COV and has a high propensity to undergo phase separation. Higher flexibility of nCOVID-19 receptor binding domain might enable it to bind multiple receptor partners. Further experimental work on the association of these receptors with spike protein may help us to explain the severity of nCOVID-19 infection in patients with comorbidities.","Garg, A.; Kumar, G.; Sinha, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,,False
64,Cooperative efforts on developing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19,"Health organizations have always sought partnership to join competencies in innovation, even with fierce competition in this sector. In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model.","Basso, F. G.; de Paulo, A.

65,Notable sequence homology of the ORF10 protein introspects the architecture of SARS-COV-2,"The global public health is endangered due to COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having similar pathology to MERS and SARS-CoV, the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely lower than 1%. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be uniquely characterized by the accessory protein ORF10, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids length each, across various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes. In this study, all missense mutations found in sequence databases were examined across twnety-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants that could possibly alter viral pathogenicity. Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Hassan, S.

67,"Computationally validated SARS-CoV-2 CTL and HTL Multi-Patch Vaccines designed by reverse epitomics approach, shows potential to cover large ethnically distributed human population worldwide","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodologyA novel reverse epitomics approach, ""overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches"" method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as ""Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches"", for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs.

ResultsWe identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line.

ConclusionHighly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.

69,SARS-CoV-2 infection paralyzes cytotoxic and metabolic functions of immune cells,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 infectious disease outbreak, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in 10 acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. Our findings reveal patients who suffer from an over activation of the immune system, a change of composition in infusion/intravenous fluids during infection with the aim to lower blood levels of glucose, glutamate, acetate and formate could avoid a life-threatening cytokine storm.

70,"Preliminary report of preclinical efficacy and safety analysis of gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, SK-01 version 1 and OZG-3861 version 1","The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no coronavirus vaccine in the market due to the novelty of this virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. Our candidate OZG-3861 version 1 (V1) is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1) is the GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine candidate. We applied the candidates intradermal to BALB/c mice to assess the toxicity and immunogenicity of the OZG-3861 V1 and SK-01 V1. Here, we report our preliminary results in vaccinated mice. When considered in terms of T and B cell responses, it was observed that especially the vaccine models containing GM-CSF as an adjuvant caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature. Another finding showed that the presence of adjuvant is more important in T cell response rather than B cell. The vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool.

The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion ({Delta}21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus.

This approach has rapidly become the most popular method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Here we present improvements to the original protocol: i) an updated primer scheme with 22 additional primers to improve genome coverage, ii) a streamlined library preparation workflow which improves demultiplexing rate for up to 96 samples and reduces hands-on time by several hours and iii) cost savings which bring the reagent cost down to {pound}10 per sample making it practical for individual labs to sequence thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to support national and international genomic epidemiology efforts.","Tyson, J.

73,Monoclonal Antibodies Capable of Binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Motif Specifically Prevent GM-CSF Induction.,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm"", and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

74,Multimerization- and glycosylation-dependent receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins,"Receptor binding studies using recombinant SARS-CoV proteins have been hampered due to challenges in approaches creating spike protein or domains thereof, that recapitulate receptor binding properties of native viruses. We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, K. M.; Tomris, I.; Turner, H.

75,Clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data reveals population structure of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been spreading rapidly and across the globe since first being reported in December 2019. To understand the evolutionary trajectory of the coronavirus, phylogenetic analysis is needed to study the population structure of SARS-CoV-2. As sequencing data worldwide is accruing rapidly, grouping them into clusters helps to organize the landscape of population structures. To effectively group these data, computational methodologies are needed to provide more productive and robust solutions for clustering. In this study, using the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the viral sequences as input features, we utilized three clustering algorithms, namely K-means, hierarchical clustering and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies to partition the viral sequences into six major clusters. Comparison of the three clustering results reveals that the three methods produced highly consistent results, but K-means performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances among the three methods. The partition of the viral sequences revealed that the six clusters differed in their geographical distributions. Using comprehensive approaches to compare the diversity and selective pressure across the clusters, we discovered a high genetic diversity between the clusters. Based on characteristics of the mutation profiles in each cluster along with their geographical distributions and evolutionary histories, we identified the extent of molecular divergence within and between the clusters. The identification of the mutations that are strongly associated with clusters have potential implications for diagnosis and pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, the clustering method will enable further study of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.","Li, Y.; Liu, Q.; Luo, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1,2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,False
76,A SARS-CoV-2 - host proximity interactome,"Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.","Samavarchi-Tehrani, P.; Abdouni, H.; Knight, J.

To help fight COVID-19, new molecular tools specifically targeting critical components of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is a major component of the viral replication processes, integral to viral particle assembly, and is a major diagnostic marker for infection and immune protection. Currently available antibody reagents targeting the nucleocapsid protein were primarily developed against the related SARS-CoV virus and are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, in this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies were tested in ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. The variable regions from the heavy and light chains from five select clones were cloned and sequenced, and preliminary epitope mapping of the sequenced clones was performed. Overall, the new antibody reagents described here will be of significant value in the fight against COVID-19.","Terry, J. S.; Anderson, L. B.; Scherman, M. S.; McAlister, C.

78,Mutation in position of 32 (G>U) of S2M differentiate human SARS-CoV2 from Bat Coronavirus,"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic pathogen that has rapidly mutated and become transmissible to humans. There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3'UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes. While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models, when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.","Vahed, M.; Vahed, M.; Sweeney, A.; Shirazi, F.

The amino-acids supporting these annotations are obtained from Voronoi interface models. The benefit of MISA is to collate annotated sequences of (homologous) chains found in different biological contexts i.e. bound with different partners or unbound. The aggregated views MISA/SSE, MISA/BSA, MISA/{Delta} ASAetc make it trivial to identify commonalities and differences between chains, to infer key interface residues, and to understand where conformational changes occur upon binding. As such, they should prove of key relevance for knowledge based annotations of protein databases such as the Protein Data Bank.

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by {gamma}S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of {gamma}S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2.

However, the immune response in mild or even asymptomatic patients remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2.

82,A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, M.

The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 g and 10 g doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

84,"The discovery of gene mutations making SARS-CoV-2 well adapted for humans: host-genome similarity analysis of 2594 genomes from China, the USA and Europe","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","Sun, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,False

A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups.

The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

86,Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness and neutralization susceptibility,"A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an ""up"" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.

ImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Böttcher, S.; Häring, C.; Giebeler, L.; Henke, A.; Zell, R.; Hornung, F.; Brandt, C.; Marquet, M.; Mosig, A.

88,An intestinal cell type in zebrafish is the nexus for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contributes to COVID-19 comorbidities,"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

SUMMARY STATEMENTGenomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.","Postlethwait, J.; Farnsworth, D.

89,Prime-boost protein subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are highly immunogenic in mice and macaques,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are advancing into human clinical trials, with emphasis on eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S). However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, H.-X.; Juno, J. A.; Lee, W.

90,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with a human intestine-on-chip device,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","Guo, Y.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Deng, P.; Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Zhang, X.; Cui, K.; Tao, T.; Li, Z.; Chen, W.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1,2020-09-02,2020-09-02,,False
91,Structural Variants in SARS-CoV-2 Occur at Template-Switching Hotspots,"The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in ""arms"" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.","Chrisman, B.; Paskov, K.; Stockham, N.; Tabatabaei, K.; Jung, J.-Y.; Washington, P.; Varma, M.; Woo Sun, M.; Maleki, S.; Wall, D.

92,Induction of a regulatory myeloid program in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19,"A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis1. To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5-8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reyes, M.; Filbin, M.

93,Drug repurposing screen identifies masitinib as a 3CLpro inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Drayman, N.; Jones, K.

94,A versatile reporter system to monitor virus infected cells and its application to dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, F.; Neufeldt, C.

95,Characterization of neutralizing versus binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India,"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining vaccine efficacy.","Nayak, K.; Gottimukkala, K.; Kumar, S.; Reddy, E.

96,"Engineered Trimeric ACE2 Binds and Locks ""Three-up"" Spike Protein to Potently Inhibit SARS-CoVs and Mutants","SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE-2, which binds the spike protein with moderate affinity. Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. The cryo-EM structure reveals that T-ACE2 can induce the transit of spike protein to ""three-up"" RBD conformation upon binding. T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.","Guo, L.; Bi, W.; Wang, X.; Xu, W.; Yan, R.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, K.; Li, Y.; Zhang, M.; Bao, X.; Cai, X.; Li, Y.; Qu, D.; Jiang, S.; Xie, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Lu, L.; Dang, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1,2020-09-01,2020-09-01,,False
97,Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms,"The zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. Animal experiments have shown that non-human primates, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits and bats can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. We also describe the first animal to human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms.

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning.

99,Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells and genomic mutational analysis of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","Friedman, N.; Jacob-Hirsch, J.; Drori, Y.; Eyal, E.; Kol, N.; Nayshool, O.; Mendelson, E.; Rechavi, G.; Mandelboim, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
