0,We are at risk too: The disparate impacts of the pandemic on younger generations,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound global impact with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is essential to understand the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviours, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of and changes in COVID-related concerns over time during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two Canadian population-based datasets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N=4,627; March 29-April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Your Mental Health (N=45,989; April 24-May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group, participants self-reported changes in behaviours and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. Results: There are age differences in behavioural responses to the pandemic; adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were stable across groups, while maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger groups. COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behaviour. Results also revealed that anxiety and worry are prevalent in response to the pandemic across all generations, with the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety among Millennials (36.0%). Finally, COVID-related concerns are greatest for younger generations and appear to be decreasing with time. Conclusion: These early data are essential in understanding at-risk groups given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its potential long-term implications.","El-Gabalawy, R.; Sommer, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159236v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159236v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
1,Prevalence and clinical correlates of COVID-19 outbreak among healthcare workers in a tertiary level hospital,"In this study, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak among Healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care hospital and compared various parameters and preventive measures taken by positive HCWs to a comparable cohort of COVID negative HCWs. 52.1% of COVID-19 positive HCWs showed symptoms of which only three needed hospitalization possibly due to a younger cohort of HCWs who got infected (35.9 +- 9.3 years). Findings of present study found some protective role of full course prophylactic hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group (p=0.021) and use of N95 masks over others (p<0.001). Our results did not show any added protection with the use of prophylactic Vitamin C, D, Zinc, or betadine gargles. We also observed outbreak control with increased awareness, near universal testing, PPE provision, sanitization drive, and promoting social distancing among HCWs.","Khurana, A.; Kaushal, G.

2,Chronic Hemodialysis Patients have better outcomes with COVID-19 - a retrospective cohort study,"Introduction Several comorbid conditions, have been identified as risk factors in patients with COVID-19. However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. This protective effect, might have a pathophysiologic basis and needs to be further explored.","Naaraayan, A.; Nimkar, A.; Hasan, A.; Pant, S.; Durdevic, M.; Elenius, H.; Nava Suarez, C.; Basak, P.; Lakshmi, K.; Mandel, M.; Jesmajian, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
3,COVID-19 Vulnerability of Transgender Women With and Without HIV Infection in the Eastern and Southern U.S.,"Background: COVID-19 is a new global pandemic and people with HIV may be particularly vulnerable. Gender identity is not reported, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including transgender people with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID vulnerability among transgender women. Setting: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC Methods: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect risk for COVID-related harms. Results: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated mistreatment, uncomfortable providers, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. Conclusions: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would have positive effects for everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, T.; Reisner, S.; Miller, M.; Wirtz, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159327v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159327v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
4,Excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: a two-stage interrupted time series analysis,"Background: Italy was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","Scortichini, M.; Schneider dos Santos, R.; De' Donato, F.; De Sario, M.; Michelozzi, P.; Davoli, M.; Masselot, P.; Sera, F.; Gasparrini, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159632v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159632v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
5,A reference for mortality in Spain from 2001 to 2019 records with an accurate estimate of excess deaths during the 2020 spring covid-19 outbreak,"Spanish official records of mortality and population in the 21st century are analyzed to determine the reference value of all cause, all age, all sex per capita death rate in the country. This reference is used to analyze the mortality in 2020, largely influenced by a massive anomaly in spring due to covid-19. The most probable mortality excess from Monday March 2 to Sunday May 24, 2020 ---W10 to W21--- is 1055{+/-}15 deaths per one million population or 49940{+/-}730 total deaths. Standard deviation is 67 deaths per one million population. The excess amounts to 53% relative to the expected number of deaths from 21st century records and yields a z-score z=16 ---extremely high excess, according to EuroMoMo classification scheme.

6,"An in-silico study on SARS-CoV-2: Its compatibility with human tRNA pool, and the polymorphism arising in a single lineage over a month","SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has costed enormous human lives in the recent past. The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORF's stability and tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA, ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50% ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.","Victor, M.; Das, R.; Ghosh, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217083v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217083v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,False
7,Cell type-specific immune dysregulation in severely ill COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become the most serious pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic. In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","Yao, C.; Bora, S.

8,Reducing COVID-19 hospitalization risk through behavior change,"Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. We used data (N=444,649) from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with reporting any of the underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to increase risk of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. Risk factors included lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk (PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic. The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible, and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits regarding chronic conditions.","ADAMS, M. L.; Katz, D.

9,Development of a quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip based portable fluorescence smart-phone system for ultrasensitive detection of IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2,"Background: Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been occurred by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The rapid and sensitive immunoassays are urgently demanded for detecting specific antibodies as assistant diagnosis for primary screening of asymptomatic individuals, close contacts,suspected or recovered patients of COIVD-19 during the pandemic period. Methods: The recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) was used as the antigen to detect specific IgM and the mixture of recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) and S-RBD were used to detect specific IgG by the newly designed quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip (QD-LFIA), respectively. Results: A rapid and sensitive QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed for detecting specific IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from 100 serum samples of COVID-19 patients and 450 plasma samples from healthy blood donors. Among 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with NAT previously, 3 were severe, 35 mild and 62 recovered cases. By using QD-LFIA, 78 (78%) and 99 (99%) samples from 100 COVID-19 patients serum were detected positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG, respectively, but only one sample (0.22%) was cross-reactive with S-RBD from 450 healthy blood donor plasmas that were collected from different areas of China. Conclusion: An ultrasensitive and specific QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed fo r detection of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be used for investigating the prevalence or assistant diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans.","Liu, B.; Li, J.; Tang, X.; Wu, Z.; Lu, J.; Liang, C.; Hou, S.; Zhang, L.; Li, T.; Zhao, W.; Fu, Y.; Ke, Y.; Li, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159392v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159392v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
10,Cerebral Microvascular Injury in Severe COVID-19,"IMPORTANCE: Microvascular lesions are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020. SETTING: Single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic deficits. EXPOSURES: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient who died from severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. In 4/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.","Conklin, J.; Frosch, M.

12,Severe COVID-19 is associated with elevated serum IgA and antiphospholipid IgA-antibodies,"Background: While the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming increasingly clear, there is little data on IgA response, the first line of bronchial immune defense. Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits. Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS. Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgA-response triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.","Hasan Ali, O.; Bomze, D.; Risch, L.; Brugger, S.

13,Distributional challenges regarding data on death and incidences during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to July 2020,"COVID-19 is a major global crisis with unpredictable consequences. Many scientists have struggled to make forecasts about its impact. Especially, appropriate preparations for a second wave are needed not to move in a costly panic mode again. It is necessary to get ideas about worst case scenarios regarding incidences, hospitalization, or use of ICU resources. They can be described in terms of extreme quantiles (95%, 99%, 99.9%) of specific distributions that supposedly formalize the data mechanism behind future observations. Therefore, distributional issues do matter. Cirillo and Taleb argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing and managing real risk in pandemics is provided by extreme value theory dealing with extrema and not averages. We explore this idea in more detail. In this paper we discuss the fat-tail patterns in the distribution of the global COVID-19 data by analyzing data from 66 countries worldwide. We also explore their relevance at a lower, regional scale perspective (national, federal state), which is in our opinion more relevant for planning measures against the epidemic spread. For this we analyze data from the German federal state of Bavaria. We conclude that fat-tail patterns are seen in global data, possibly reflecting the respective heterogeneity between different countries regarding incidences and fatalities during the ongoing epidemic. However, the disease activity at regional level seems to be better described by classical Poisson based models. To bridge the gap between regional and global phenomena we refer to mixtures of slim-tail distributions that may create fat-tail features. Especially in the beginning of a pandemic acting according to the ""better safe than sorry"" principle and taking extreme forecasts as the basis for the decisions might be justified. However, as the pandemic continues and control measures are partially lifted, there is a need for a careful discussion how to choose relevant distributions and their respective quantiles for future resource planning in order not to cause more harm as the pandemic itself.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
14,Rhythmic components of COVID-19 daily cases in various countries,"Not only does COVID-19 pandemic encourage scientists to look for remedies and treatment schemes, but also identify the drivers of pathogenicity and spread of the virus. The scope of this research consisted in identifying recurrence patterns and comparing the number of daily cases between various countries. Data for countries where at least 500 daily cases were recorded at least once (17 in Europe, 3 in North America, 7 in South America, 3 in Central America, 17 in Asia and 3 in Africa). According to our evaluation, the dynamics recorded for 25 countries includes a 7-day statistically significant component. This statistically significant weekly component has been identified in 76% of the countries examined in Europe, 66% in North America, 71% in South America, and 18% in Asia. The range of this rhythmic component is low at the growth stage and increases at the stabilization and decrease stages. The weekly phases feature shifting peaks depending on the country. In some cases, the phases shift, i.e. they are not limited strictly to certain days of the week. Due to range and phase variation, its explanation cannot be limited to strictly medical and social factors. In some cases, national incidence dynamics includes 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10-day periods. Understanding the factors of recurrence patterns in COVID-19 incidence dynamics may help in the pandemic response.","Drozdov, A. V.; Zenchenko, T.

15,High variation expected in the pace and burden of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across sub-Saharan Africa,"A surprising feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date is the low burdens reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries relative to other global regions. Potential explanations (e.g., warmer environments [1], younger populations [2,3,4]) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis accounting for factors that may offset the effects of climate and demography. Here, we synthesize factors hypothesized to shape the pace of this pandemic and its burden as it moves across SSA, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare and intervention capacity, and human mobility dimensions of risk. We find large scale diversity in probable drivers, such that outcomes are likely to be highly variable among SSA countries. While simulation shows that extensive climatic variation among SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories, heterogeneity in connectivity is likely to play a large role in shaping the pace of viral spread. The prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks expected in weakly connected settings may result in extended stress to health systems. In addition, the observed variability in comorbidities and access to care will likely modulate the severity of infection: We show that even small shifts in the infection fatality ratio towards younger ages, which are likely in high risk settings, can eliminate the protective effect of younger populations. We highlight countries with elevated risk of slow pace, high burden outbreaks. Empirical data on the spatial extent of outbreaks within SSA countries, their patterns in severity over age, and the relationship between epidemic pace and health system disruptions are urgently needed to guide efforts to mitigate the high burden scenarios explored here.","Rice, B.

16,Overweight/obesity as the potentially most important lifestyle factor associated with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19,"Objective The occurrence of pneumonia separates severe cases of COVID-19 from the majority of cases with mild disease. However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients (n=201). Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29 - 5.59) p=0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","Sacco, V.; Rauch, B.; Gar, C.; Haschka, S.; Potzel, A.

17,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces sustained humoral immune responses in convalescent patients following symptomatic COVID-19,"Long-term antibody responses and neutralizing activities following SARS-CoV-2 infections have not yet been elucidated. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of six months following COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, which were among the first world-wide being infected. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increased rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset were associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlated closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. While specific IgM-S/N became undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers showed an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilized at relatively high levels over the six months observation period. At late time points the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was still over 70%. Taken together, our data indicate sustained humoral immunity in recovered patients who suffer from symptomatic COVID-19, suggesting prolonged immunity.","Wu, J.; Liang, B.; Chen, C.; Wang, H.; Fang, Y.; Shen, S.; Yang, X.; Wang, B.; Chen, L.; Chen, Q.; Wu, Y.; Liu, J.; Yang, X.; Li, W.; Zhu, B.; Zhou, W.; Wang, H.; Li, S.; Lu, S.; Liu, D.; Li, H.; Krawczyk, A.; Lu, M.; Yang, D.; Deng, F.; Dittmer, U.; Trilling, M.; Zheng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159178v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159178v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
18,Model-free estimation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics from a complete outbreak,"Background New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. Method We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Findings Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately normally distributed (=5.0 days, {sigma}=5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of cases reduced secondary transmission rates. Interpretation Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

19,Comparative Evaluation of 19 Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays for Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemics. To facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various RT-LAMP assays using 19 sets of primers had been developed, but never been compared. We performed comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients. Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and Set-14 (75.9%), and Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (< 8.5 minutes), followed by Set-17 (< 12.5 minutes). Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are determined to be better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) are recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.","Dong, Y.; Wu, X.; Li, S.; Lu, R.; Wan, Z.; Qin, J.; Yu, G.; Jin, X.; Zhang, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
20,Initial Experience in Predicting the Risk of Hospitalization of 496 Outpatients with COVID-19 Using a Telemedicine Risk Assessment Tool,"Objective: To determine whether a risk prediction tool developed and implemented in March 2020 accurately predicts subsequent hospitalizations. Design: Retrospective cohort study, enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020 with follow-up calls until hospitalization or clinical improvement (final calls until June 19, 2020) Setting: Single center telemedicine program managing outpatients from a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia Participants: 496 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in isolation at home. Exclusion criteria included: (1) hospitalization prior to telemedicine program enrollment, (2) immediate discharge with no follow-up calls due to resolution. Exposure: Acute COVID-19 illness Main Outcome and Measures: Hospitalization was the outcome. Days to hospitalization was the metric. Survival analysis using Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with hospitalization. Results: The risk-assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to risk tiers as follows: Tier 1, 237 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 (37.3%); Tier 3, 74 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 (1%), 15 (7%), and 17 (23%) and for Tiers 1-3, respectively. From a Cox regression model with age [&ge;] 60, gender, and self-reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios using Tier 1 as reference were: Tier 2 HR=3.74 (95% CI, 1.06-13.27; P=0.041); Tier 3 HR=10.87 (95% CI, 3.09-38.27; P<0.001). Tier was the strongest predictor of time to hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: A telemedicine risk assessment tool prospectively applied to an outpatient population with COVID-19 identified both low-risk and high-risk patients with better performance than individual risk factors alone. This approach may be appropriate for optimum allocation of resources.","O'Keefe, J. B.; Tong, E. J.; Taylor, T. H.; Datoo O'Keefe, G. D.; Tong, D.

In the light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. We showed that ACE2 is indeed present in human pancreatic islets, where is preferentially expressed by insulin producing {beta}-cells. Of note, pro-inflammatory cytokines increased ACE2 expression in {beta}-cells, thus putatively suggesting an enhancement of {beta}-cells sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 during inflammatory conditions.

23,Rapid in vitro assays for screening neutralizing antibodies and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2,"Towards the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, and has been responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our MNA is compatible with HTS settings to interrogate large and/or complex libraries of mAbs and/or antivirals to identify those with neutralizing and/or antiviral activity, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2.","Oark, J.-G.; Oladduni, F.

24,Transcriptional response modules characterise IL-1 and IL-6 activity in COVID-19,"Dysregulated IL-1 and IL-6 responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1 and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1 or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis, and discerns the effect of therapeutic cytokine blockade in JIA. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1 and IL-6 response modules, but not these cytokines per se, is a feature of disease both in blood and in affected organs. We propose that IL-1 and IL-6 transcriptional response modules can provide a dynamic readout of the activity of these cytokine pathways in vivo, with potential applications for identifying COVID-19 patients who may benefit from IL-1 or IL-6 blocking therapy, and to aid quantification of the biological effects of these treatments.","Bell, L.

We obtained serum from thirteen COVID-19 patients. Most individuals revealed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 assessed by a pseudotype virus-neutralizing assay. The antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed by ELISA. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa.), which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients. In the further analysis of the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array, a hot spot in the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was observed in individuals with neutralizing activity.

Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred. Conclusion: Data from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.","LOFGREN, S. M. M.; Nicol, M.

Design: A three-phase online Delphi process and virtual consensus meeting sought consensus over the investigation, management and research priorities from 98 multidisciplinary participants caring for children with PIMS-TS. 46 participants (47%) completed all three phases. Participants were grouped into three panels and scored each statement from 1 (disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). In phase two participants were shown their panels scores, and in phase three all panels scores. Consensus agreement was defined as [&ge;]70% of participants in each panel scoring the statement 7-9, and <15% scoring 1-3, and consensus disagreement was the opposite of this. Statements which achieved consensus in 2/3 panels were discussed at the consensus meeting, and when [&ge;]70% participants agreed with the statement it achieved consensus. Results: 255 statements were assessed, with consensus agreement achieved for 111 (44%), consensus disagreement for 29 (11%), and no consensus for 115 (45%).

30,Single-dose intranasal vaccination elicits systemic and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"A safe and durable vaccine is urgently needed to tackle the COVID19 pandemic that has infected >15 million people and caused >620,000 deaths worldwide. As with other respiratory pathogens, the nasal compartment is the first barrier that needs to be breached by the SARS-CoV-2 virus before dissemination to the lung. Despite progress at remarkable speed, current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA- sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.","An, X.; Martinez, M.

32,SECOND WEEK METHYL-PREDNISOLONE PULSES IMPROVE PROGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 PNEUMONIA: AN OBSERVATIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDY USING ROUTINE CARE DATA.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of a short course of methyl-prednisolone pulses (MP) during the second week of disease (week-2) on the clinical course of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. DESIGN: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Cruces, a tertiary level University hospital at Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between 1st March and 30th April 2020 to the services of Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with week-2-MP (125-250 mg/d for 3 consecutive days with no subsequent tapering) vs. standard of care. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Time to death and time to death or endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers at admission were included in the study. Sixty-one patients (25%) received week-2-MP. Twenty-two patients (9%) died during the study period. Thirty-one patients (12.8%) suffered death or intubation. The adjusted HR for death was 0.35 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.06, p= 0.064) for patients in the week-2-MP group. The adjusted HR for death or intubation week-2-MP was 0.33 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.84, p=0.020) for patients in the week-2-MP group. These differences were seen in the subcohort of patients with a SaO2/FiO2 at day 7 lower than the median of the whole population: HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12, p=0.073 and HR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.94, p=0.038, respectively, but not in patients with higher SaO2/FiO2. Other predictors of the final outcomes were arterial hypertension, SaO2/FiO2, high-risk CURB65 scores and the use of non-pulse glucocorticoids. Non-pulse glucocorticoids were a predictor of infections (OR 4.72, 95%CI 1.90 to 11.80, p<0.001), while week-2-MP were not (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.40 to 2.70, p=0.938). CONCLUSIONS: Week-2-MP are effective in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with features of inflammatory activity and respiratory deterioration entering the second week of disease. The recognition of this high-risk population should prompt early use of MP at this point.

33,SARS-CoV2 genome analysis of Indian isolates and molecular modelling of D614G mutated spike protein with TMPRSS2 depicted its enhanced interaction and virus infectivity,"COVID-19 that emerged as a global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","Raghav, S.; Ghosh, A.; Turuk, J.; Kumar, S.; Jha, A.; Madhulika, S.; Priyadarshini, M.; Biswas, V.

34,Oral delivery of SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccines using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a carrier in rat,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the disease that has been identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation. The effective delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids to the immune system's inductive cells constitutes an essential requirement for the generation of effective DNA vaccines. Here, we have explored the use of Salmonella typhimurium as vehicles to deliver expression plasmids orally. Attenuated Salmonella phoP harboring eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was administered orally to Wistar rats. Rats were immunized orally with Salmonella that carried a eukaryotic expression plasmid once a week for three consecutive weeks. The efficiency of the vaccination procedure was due to the transfer of the expression plasmid from the bacterial carrier to the mammalian host. Evidence for such an event could be obtained in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that all immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating that a Salmonella-based vaccine carrying the Spike gene can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yang, D.; Zhu, D.; Meng, Y.; Qimuge, A.; Bilige, B.; Baiyin, T.; Temuqile, T.; Chen, S.; Borjigen, S.; Baigude, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217174v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217174v1?rss=1,2020-07-23,2020-07-23,,False
35,Neonatal hyperoxia enhances age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice,"The severity of COVID-19 lung disease is higher in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities. People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) between postnatal days 0-4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","Yee, M.; Cohen, E.

36,FDA approved calcium channel blockers inhibit SARS CoV 2 infectivity in epithelial lung cells,"Covid-19 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide causing over 600.000 deaths1. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares a high sequence similarity to SARS CoV2. Currently there are no vaccinations available to provide protection and the only antiviral therapy in active use in patients is remdesivir, which currently provides only limited benefit3. Hence, there is an urgent need for antiviral therapies against SARS CoV 2. SARS CoV requires Ca2+ ions for host cell entry4 and based on the similarity between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 25 it is highly likely that the same requirements exist for the two viruses. Here, we tested whether FDA-approved calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs are efficacious to inhibit the spread of SARS CoV 2 in cell culture. Our data shows that amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine limit the growth of SARS CoV 2 in epithelial kidney (Vero E6) and epithelial lung (Calu-3) cells. We observed some differences in the inhibition efficacy of the drugs in the two different cell lines, but with felodopine and nifedipine having the greatest effect. Overall, our data suggest that CCBs have a high potential to treat SARS CoV 2 infections and their current FDA approval would allow for a fast repurposing of these drugs.","Straus, M.

37,The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein increases infectivity in an ACE2 receptor dependent manner,"The SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic has been reported to have a relatively low mutation rate. Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.","Ogawa, J.; Zhu, W.; Tonnu, N.; Singer, O.; Hunter, T.; Ryan (Firth), A.

38,Rescue of SARS-CoV-2 from a single bacterial artificial chromosome,"An infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, causing a pandemic that has dramatically impacted public health and socioeconomic activities worldwide. A previously unknown coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To date, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has triggered a large influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have developed an infectious cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).

Recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 was readily rescued by transfection of the BAC into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, the BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those of the SARS-CoV-2 natural isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed similar levels of replication to that of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs of infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC based reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2 that displays similar features in vivo to that of a natural viral isolate. This SARS-CoV-2 BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing several important questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of antivirals and development of vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","Ye, C.; Park, J.-G.; Oladunni, F.; Platt, R.

39,Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry is attenuated by TMPRSS2,"Hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria and some autoimmune disorders, potently inhibits viral infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell-culture studies. However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.

Author SummaryThe novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and remains a threat to global public health. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to prevent viral infection in cell-culture systems, but human clinical trials did not observe a significant improvement in COVID-19 patients treated with these compounds. Here we show that hydroxychloroquine interferes with only one of two somewhat redundant pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is activated to mediate infection. The first pathway is dependent on the endosomal protease cathepsin L and sensitive to hydroxychloroquine, whereas the second pathway is dependent on TMPRSS2, which is unaffected by this compound. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 is more reliant than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) on the TMPRSS2 pathway, and that this difference is due to a furin cleavage site present in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we show that combinations of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor work together to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry. Thus TMPRSS2 expression on physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 target cells may bypass the antiviral activities of hydroxychloroquine, and explain its lack of in vivo efficacy.","Ou, T.; Mou, H.; Zhang, L.; Ojha, A.; Choe, H.; Farzan, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.216150v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.216150v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,False
40,Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants,"Neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or vaccination are likely to be key for future protection of individuals and populations against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.","Weisblum, Y.; Schmidt, F.; Zhang, F.; DaSilva, J.; Poston, D.; Lorenzi, J.

The unavailability of a specific treatment regime and a candidate vaccine yet opens up scope for new approaches and discoveries of drugs for mitigation of the sufferings of humankind due to the disease. The present isolated whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 11 different nations subjected to evolutionary study and genome-wide association study through in silico approaches including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic study through MEGA7 and have been analyzed through DNAsp respectively. These investigations recognized the nucleotide varieties and single nucleotide mutations/polymorphisms on the genomic regions as well as protein-coding regions. The resulted mutations have diversified the genomic contents of SARS-CoV-2 according to the altered nucleotides found in 11 genome sequences. India and Nepal have found to have progressively more distinct species of SARS-CoV-2 with variations in Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein-coding sites. These genomic variations might be the explanation behind the less case fatality rate of India and Nepal dependent on the populaces. The anticipated idea of this investigation upgrades the information about genomic medication and might be useful in the planning of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Ray, M.; Sarkar, S.; Rath, S.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, which is mediated by the viral spike protein and host ACE2 receptor, is an essential target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and drugs. Using a mammalian cell expression system, we generated a recombinant fluorescent protein (Gamillus)-fused SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (STG) to probe the viral entry process. In ACE2-expressing cells, we found that the STG probe has excellent performance in the live-cell visualization of receptor binding, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 under virus-free conditions. The new system allows quantitative analyses of the inhibition potentials and detailed influence of COVID-19-convalescent human plasmas, neutralizing antibodies and compounds, providing a versatile tool for high-throughput screening and phenotypic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.

43,The discovery of a recombinant SARS2-like CoV strain provides insights into SARS and COVID-2019 pandemics,"In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the present study, we classified betacoronavirus subgroup B into the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoV clusters, and the ORF8 genes of these three clusters into types 1, 2 and 3, respectively. One important result of our study is that the recently reported strain RmYN02 was identified as a recombinant SARS2-like CoV strain that belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 cluster, but has an ORF8 from a SARS-like CoV. This result provides substantial proof for long-existing hypotheses regarding the recombination and biological functions of ORF8. Based on the analysis of recombination events in the Spike gene, we propose that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may have more than one specific receptor for its function as gp120 of HIV has CD4 and CCR5. We concluded that the furin protease cleavage site acquired by SARS-CoV-2 may increase the efficiency of viral entry into cells, while the type 2 ORF8 acquired by SARS-CoV may increase its replication efficiency. These two most critical events provide the most likely explanation for SARS and COVID-2019 pandemics.","Li, X.; Jin, X.; Chen, S.; Wang, L.; Yau, T.

Modeling the trend of infection and real-time forecasting of cases can help decision making and control of the disease spread. However, data-driven methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can perform poorly due to limited daily samples in time. In this work, we develop an integrated spatiotemporal model based on the epidemic differential equations (SIR) and RNN. The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.","Li, Z.; Zheng, Y.; Xin, J.; Zhou, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158568v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158568v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,True
45,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: results from the prospective AspCOVID-19 study,"Background: Superinfections, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), are well-known complications of critically ill patients with severe viral pneumonia. Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. Findings: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p=0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p=0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. Interpretation: CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate.

46,Assessing the relative contributions of healthcare protocols for epidemic control: an example with network transmission model for COVID-19,"The increasing number of COVID-19 cases threatens human life and requires retainment actions that control the spread of the virus in the absence of effective medical therapy or a reliable vaccine. There is a general consensus that the most efficient health protocol in the actual state is to disrupt the infection chain through social distancing, although economic interests stand against closing non-essential activities and poses a debatable tradeoff. In this study, we used an individual-based age-structured network model to assess the effective roles of different healthcare protocols such as the use of personal protection equipment and social distancing at neighbor- and city-level scales. Using as much as empirical data available in the literature, we calibrated a city model and simulated low, medium, and high parameters representing these protocols. Our results revealed that the model was more sensitive to changes in the parameter representing the rate of contact among people from different neighborhoods, which defends the social distancing at the city-level as the most effective protocol for the control of the disease outbreak. Another important identified parameter represented the use of individual equipment such as masks, face shields, and hand sanitizers like alcohol-based solutions and antiseptic products. Interestingly, our simulations suggest that some periodical activities such as going to the supermarket, gas station, and pharmacy would have little contribution to the SARS-CoV-2 spread once performed within the same neighborhood. As we can see nowadays, there is an inevitable context-dependency and economic pressure on the level of social distancing recommendations, and we reinforce that every decision must be a welfare-oriented science-based decision.","Baumgartner, M.

47,In-silico modeling of COVID-19 ARDS: pathophysiological insights and potential management implications,"Objectives: Patients with COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) appear to present with at least two distinct phenotypes: severe hypoxemia with relatively well-preserved lung compliance and lung gas volumes (Type 1) and a more conventional ARDS phenotype displaying the typical characteristics of the baby lung (Type 2). We aimed to test plausible hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CARDS, and to evaluate the resulting implications for ventilatory management. Design: We adapted a high-fidelity computational simulator, previously validated in several studies of ARDS, to (a) develop quantitative insights into the key pathophysiologic differences between CARDS and conventional ARDS, and (b) assess the impact of different PEEP, FiO2 and tidal volume settings. Setting: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Systems Medicine Research Network. Subjects: The simulator was calibrated to represent CARDS patients with both normal and elevated body mass indices undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Measurements and Main Results: An ARDS model implementing disruption of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions failed to replicate clinical data on Type 1 CARDS patients. Adding mechanisms to reflect disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and heightened vascular resistance due to the emergence of microthrombi, produced levels of V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia consistent with data from Type 1 CARDS patients, while preserving close to normal lung compliance and gas volumes. Atypical responses to PEEP increments between 5 and 15 cmH2O were observed for this Type 1 CARDS model across a range of measures: increasing PEEP resulted in reduced lung compliance and no improvement in oxygenation, while Mechanical Power, Driving Pressure and Plateau Pressure all increased. FiO2 settings based on ARDSnet protocols at different PEEP levels were insufficient to achieve adequate oxygenation. Incrementing tidal volumes from 5 to 10 ml/kg produced similar increases in multiple indicators of ventilator induced lung injury in the Type 1 CARDS model to those seen in a conventional ARDS model. Conclusions: Our model suggests that use of standard PEEP/ FiO2 tables, higher PEEP strategies, and higher tidal volumes, may all be potentially deleterious in Type 1 CARDS patients, and that a highly personalized approach to treatment is advisable.","Das, A.; Saffaran, S.; Chikhani, M.; Scott, T.; Laviola, M.; Yehya, N.; Laffey, J.; Hardman, J.

48,Real-time IP-10 measurements as a new tool for inflammation regulation within a clinical decision support protocol for managing severe COVID-19 patients,"The challenge of treating severely ill COVID-19 patients is particularly great due to the need to simultaneously manage oxygenation and the inflammatory state without compromising viral clearance. Currently, there are many tools to aid in oxygen management and in monitoring viral replication. However, predictive biomarkers for monitoring the host immune response across COVID-19 disease stages and specifically, for titrating immunomodulatory therapy are lacking. We utilized a recently cleared platform (MeMed Key) that enables rapid and easy serial measurement of IP-10, a host protein implicated in lung injury due to viral-induced hyperinflammation. A dynamic clinical decision support protocol was employed for managing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a COVID-19 dedicated medical center run by Clalit Health Services. This is the first protocol to include real-time measurements of IP-10 as a potential aid for regulating inflammation. Overall, 502 serial real-time IP-10 measurements were performed on 52 patients recruited between 7th April 2020 to 10th May 2020, with 12 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). IP-10 levels correlated with increased COVID-19 severity score and ICU admission. Within the ICU admitted patients, the number of days with IP-10 measurements >1,000 pg/ml was associated with mortality. Upon administration of corticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, a significant decrease in IP-10 levels was observed. Real-time IP-10 monitoring represents a new tool to aid in management and therapeutic decisions relating to the inflammatory status of COVID-19 patients.","Lev, S.; Gottesman, T.; Sahaf Levin, G.; Lederfein, D.; Berkov, E.; Diker, D.; Zaidman, A.; Nutman, A.; Ilan Ber, T.; Angel, A.; Kellerman, L.; Barash, E.; Navon, R.; Boico, O.; Israeli, Y.; Rosenberg, M.; Gelman, A.; Kalfon, R.; Simon, E.; Avni, N.; Hainrichson, M.; Zarchin, O.; Gottlieb, T.

49,Central Nervous System Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: At the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory infection, initially reported in China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between January 1st, 2020, to April 20th, 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456). Results: Of 2353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11282 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID-19 were Headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), Dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%), and Impaired consciousness (1.9%, 95%CI: 1%-2.79%). Conclusions: The growing number of studies have reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.","Nazari, S.; Azari Jafari, A.; Mirmoeeni, S.; Sadeghian, S.; Heidari, M.

50,Temporal dynamics of human respiratory and gut microbiomes during the course of COVID-19 in adults,"SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including the respiratory tract and gut. Whether regional microbiomes are disturbed significantly to affect the disease progression of COVID-19 is largely unknown. To address this question, we performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of throat and anal swabs from 35 COVID-19 adults and 15 controls by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results allowed a partitioning of patients into 3-4 categories (I-IV) with distinct microbial community types in both sites. Lower-diversity community types often appeared in the early phase of COVID-19, and synchronous fast restoration of both the respiratory and gut microbiomes from early dysbiosis towards late near-normal was observed in 6/8 mild COVID-19 adult patients despite they had a relatively slow clinical recovery. The synchronous shift of the community types was associated with significantly positive bacterial interactions between the respiratory tract and gut, possibly along the airway-gut axis. These findings reveal previously unknown interactions between respiratory and gut microbiomes, and suggest that modulations of regional microbiota might help to improve the recovery from COVID-19 in adult patients.","Xu, R.; Lu, R.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Q.; Cai, W.; Han, X.; Jin, X.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.; Wan, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158758v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,True

We have developed a rapid test for screening SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies using genome-free virus-like particles incorporated with a small luciferase peptide, HiBiT. Their entry into LgBiT-expressing target cells reconstitutes NanoLuc luciferase readily detected by a luminometer. This newly developed HiBiT-tagged Virus-like particle-based Neutralization Test (hiVNT) can readily quantify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies within three hours with a high-throughput in a low biosafety setting. Moreover, the neutralizing activity obtained from hiVNT was highly consistent with that measured by the conventional neutralization test using authentic SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, antibody responses to both viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins correlated with the neutralization activity assessed by hiVNT. Our newly-developed hiVNT could be instrumental to survey individuals for the presence of functional neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2.","Miyakawa, K.; Jeremiah, S.

53,Kinetics and Isotype Assessment of Antibodies Targeting the Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 In COVID-19 Patients as a function of Age and Biological Sex.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the newly emerged virus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic. There is an incomplete understanding of the host humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during acute infection. Host factors such as age and sex as well the kinetics and functionality of antibody responses are important factors to consider as vaccine development proceeds. The receptor-binding domain of the CoV spike (RBD-S) protein is important in host cell recognition and infection and antibodies targeting this domain are often neutralizing. In a cross-sectional study of anti-RBD-S antibodies in COVID-19 patients we found equivalent levels in male and female patients and no age-related deficiencies even out to 93 years of age. The anti-RBD-S response was evident as little as 6 days after onset of symptoms and for at least 5 weeks after symptom onset. Anti-RBD-S IgG, IgM, and IgA responses were simultaneously induced within 10 days after onset, but isotype-specific kinetics differed such that anti-RBD-S IgG was most sustained over a 5-week period. The kinetics and magnitude of neutralizing antibody formation strongly correlated with that seen for anti-RBD-S antibodies. Our results suggest age- and sex- related disparities in COVID-19 fatalities are not explained by anti-RBD-S responses. The multi-isotype anti-RBD-S response induced by live virus infection could serve as a potential marker by which to monitor vaccine-induced responses.","Graham, N. R.; Whitaker, A. N.; Strother, C.

54,The effect of border controls on the risk of COVID-19 reincursion from international arrivals,"In an attempt to maintain elimination of COVID-19, the New Zealand government has closed the border to everyone except citizens and residents. All arrivals are required to spend 14 days in government-managed isolation/quarantine and to be tested for COVID-19 on day 3 and on day 12 of their stay. We model the testing, isolation and potential transmission of COVID-19 within managed isolation facilities to estimate the risk of undetected cases and the risk of infectious cases being released into the community. We use a stochastic individual-based that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result, complete isolation of confirmed and probable cases, and secondary transmission of COVID-19 between close contacts. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with day 3 and day 12 testing reduces risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increase this risk. It is important to avoid contacts between individuals staying in quarantine to minimise the risk of secondary transmission. We calculate the ratio of cases detected on day 3 to cases detected on day 12 in the model and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of secondary transmission occurring within quarantine. We do not explicitly model transmission of COVID-19 from individuals in quarantine to staff, but this is likely to present a significant risk. This needs to be minimised by strict infection control, use of personal protective equipment by staff at all times, and avoiding close contact between staff and hotel guests.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

55,The Trans-omics Landscape of COVID-19,"System-wide molecular characteristics of COVID-19, especially in those patients without comorbidities, have not been fully investigated. We compared extensive molecular profiles of blood samples from 231 COVID-19 patients, ranging from asymptomatic to critically ill, importantly excluding those with any comorbidities. Amongst the major findings, asymptomatic patients were characterized by highly activated anti-virus interferon, T/natural killer (NK) cell activation, and transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNAs. However, given very abundant RNA binding proteins (RBPs), these cytokine mRNAs could be effectively destabilized hence preserving normal cytokine levels. In contrast, in critically ill patients, cytokine storm due to RBPs inhibition and tryptophan metabolites accumulation contributed to T/NK cell dysfunction. A machine-learning model was constructed which accurately stratified the COVID-19 severities based on their multi-omics features. Overall, our analysis provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies targets for intervening in treatment.","Wu, P.; Chen, D.; Ding, W.; Wu, P.; Hou, H.; Bai, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Li, K.; Xiang, S.; Liu, P.; Ju, J.; Guo, E.; Liu, J.; Yang, B.; Fan, J.; He, L.; Sun, Z.; Feng, L.; Wang, J.; Wu, T.; Wang, H.; Cheng, J.; Xing, H.; Meng, Y.; Li, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Luo, H.; Xie, G.; Lan, X.; Tao, Y.; Yuan, H.; Huang, K.; Sun, W.; Qian, X.; Li, Z.; Huang, M.; Ding, P.; Wang, H.; Qiu, J.; Wang, F.; Wang, S.; Zhu, J.; Ding, X.; Chai, C.; Liang, L.; Wang, X.; Luo, L.; Sun, Y.; Yang, Y.; Zhuang, Z.; Li, T.; Tian, L.; Zhang, S.; Zhu, L.; Chen, L.; Wu, Y.; Ma, X.; Chen, F.; Ren, Y.; Xu, X.; Liu, S.; Wang, J.; Yang, H.; Wang, L.; Sun, C.; Ma, D.; Jin, X.; Chen, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155150v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155150v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,True
56,"Importation of SARS-CoV-2 following the ""semaine de relache"" and Quebec's (Canada) COVID-19 burden - a mathematical modeling study","Background: The Canadian epidemics of COVID-19 exhibit distinct early trajectories, with Quebec bearing a very high initial burden. The semaine de relache, or March break, took place two weeks earlier in Quebec as compared to the rest of Canada. This event may have played a role in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to examine the role of case importation in the early transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec. Methods: Using detailed surveillance data, we developed and calibrated a deterministic SEIR-type compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We explored the impact of altering the number of imported cases on hospitalizations. Specifically, we investigated scenarios without case importation after March break, and as scenarios where cases were imported with the same frequency/timing as neighboring Ontario. Results: A total of 1,544 and 1,150 returning travelers were laboratory-confirmed in Quebec and Ontario, respectively (with symptoms onset before 2020-03-25). The cumulative number of hospitalizations could have been reduced by 55% (95% credible interval [95%CrI]: 51-59%) had no cases been imported after Quebec's March break. However, had Quebec experienced Ontario's number of imported cases, cumulative hospitalizations would have only been reduced by 12% (95%CrI: 8-16%). Interpretation: Our results suggest that case importation played an important role in the early spread of COVID-19 in Quebec. Yet, heavy importation of SARS-CoV-2 in early March could be insufficient to resolve interprovincial heterogeneities in cumulative hospitalizations. The importance of other factors -public health preparedness, responses, and capacity- should be investigated.","Godin, A.; Xia, Y.; Buckeridge, D.

57,Examining COVID19 Positivity-Ratio Trends in US States from April-July: Are Rising Caseloads Attributable to <More Testing> and Do State Political-Affiliations Play a Role?,"Importance: Rising Covid19 cases in the US are attributed by some political leaders to more testing. Positivity-ratios (cases to tests ratio) in conjunction with cases and tests provide a better overview. However, comprehensive overviews of positivity-ratio patterns are scarce. Objective: To examine trends in positivity-ratios, tests and cases by state from mid-April-mid-July. Further, to examine whether positivity-ratio patters are associated with state political-affiliations. Methods: State-level publicly available data on Covid19 is used. Seven-day moving averages (MA7) of positivity-ratio are computed for April 21-July 15. States are assigned to four groups based on patterns of change in positivity-ratio: higher at end of study period than beginning (Group 1), initial decline but subsequent increase starting Memorial Day weekend (Group 2), initial decrease but an upturn in last 14 days (Group 3), and consistent downward trend (Group 4). Political-affiliation is categorized as <Republican-leaning> if President Trump won the state and the governor is Republican. Additionally, a proxy measure is used to indicate intensity of Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests in the state. Associations are tested using chi-square analysis. Results: Fourteen states are in Group 1, fifteen states in Group 2, fifteen states in Group 3, and six states and DC in Group 4. 78.57% of Group 1, 33.33% of Group 2, 40% of group 3, and none in Group 4 were Republican-leaning. The difference in distribution was statistically significant (p<0.01). Distribution of high-intensity BLM protests across the four groups was not statistically different (p>0.10). Conclusion: Increased Covid19 cases cannot be attributed to more testing. Indeed, the high positivity-ratios in most states indicate current testing is failing to capture actual infection rates. The association between state political-affiliation and positivity-ratios suggests Republican voters may be somewhat more skeptical of the gravity of the disease and emphasizes the importance of messaging by political leaders.","Sen, B.

We merged several publicly available data sets for the purpose. Projections using actual Government data as of June 16, 2020 reveals that the epidemic curve for Bangladesh may be different from that of developed countries and quite similar to such curves in countries in the region. This is true, both in terms of incidence of cases (total number of cases per million population) and length of the epidemic (months to peak or flatten the epidemic curve). We find that while Bangladesh went into lockdown early, efforts to maintain lockdown at a national level was relaxed and new cases accelerated; with significant growth happening since lifting of lockdown on May 31. Our estimates indicate prevalence of COVID-19 may be between 200,000 and 600,000 towards end of the year, may take 9 months (270 days) to flatten the epidemic curve, lifting of the lockdown may have increased total cases by 60 to 100% and may have prolonged the epidemic by additional 2-3 months.","Shimul, S.

59,Regional variability in time-varying transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea,"In South Korea, the total number of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is 13,711 including 293 deaths as of July 18, 2020. To examine the change of the growth rate of the outbreak, we present estimates of the transmissibility of COVID-19 in the four most affected regions in the country: Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu. The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in these regions by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval of COVID-19. In Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, the first major peak of COVID-19 occurred in early March, with the estimated reproduction number in February being as high as 4.24 and 8.86, respectively. In Gyeongbuk Province, the reproduction number reached 3.49 in February 8 and declined to a value below 1.00 on March 10, 2020, and similarly in Daegu, it decreased from 4.38 to 1.00 between February 5 and March 5. However, the loosening of the restrictions imposed by the government has triggered a resurgence of new cases in all regions considered, resulting in a reproduction number in May 2020 estimated at 3.04 and 4.78 in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, repectively. Even though our findings indicate the effectiveness of the control measures against COVID-19 in Korea, they also indicate the potential resurgence and sustained transmission of COVID-19, supporting the continuous implementation of social distancing measures to control the outbreak.","Shim, E.; Chowell, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158923v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158923v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,True

Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism of these drugs by combining experiments and simulations. In vitro assays confirm the hypothesis that both drugs act by inhibiting the human protein TMPRSS2. As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the TMPRSS2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 280 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov modeling. We describe the binding mode of both drugs with TMPRSS2 in a Michaelis complex (MC) state preceding the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat to has a higher MC population, which in turn leads to the more frequent formation of the covalent complex and thus higher inhibition efficacy, as confirmed in vitro and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays. Our TMPRSS2-drug structures are made public to guide the design of more potent and specific inhibitors.","Hempel, T.; Raich, L.; Olsson, S.; Azouz, N. P.; Klingler, A. M.; Rothenberg, M.

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish an exhaustive high-resolution map of blood antigen-presenting cells (APC) in 7 COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe pneumonia, at day-1 and day-4 post-admission, and two healthy donors. We generated a unique dataset of 31,513 high quality APC, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multiprocess and previously unrecognized defects in anti-viral immune defense in specific APC compartments from severe patients: i) increase of pro-apoptotic genes exclusively in pDC, which are key effectors of antiviral immunity, ii) sharp decrease of innate sensing receptors, TLR7 and DHX9, in pDC and cDC1, respectively, iii) down-regulation of antiviral effector molecules, including Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in all monocyte subsets, and iv) decrease of MHC class II-related genes, and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) activity in cDC2, suggesting a viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore defective immune defense.","Saichi, M.; Ladjemi, M.

63,Intranasal Immunization with a Lentiviral Vector Coding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Confers Vigorous Protection in Pre-Clinical Animal Models,"We developed a potent vaccination strategy, based on lentiviral vector (LV), capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies specific to the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among several LV encoding distinct variants of S, a single one encoding the full-length, membrane anchored S (LV::SFL) triggered high antibody titers in mice, with neutralization activities comparable to patients recovered from COVID-19. LV::SFL systemic vaccination in mice, in which the expression of the CoV2 receptor hACE2 was induced by transduction of the respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral type 5 (Ad5) vector, despite an intense serum neutralizing activity, only {approx}1 log10 reduction of lung viral loads was observed after SARS-CoV2 challenge.

We thus explored the strategy of targeting the immune response to the upper respiratory tract through an intranasal boost administration. Even though, after a prime and target regimen, the systemic neutralizing activity did not increase substantially, {approx}5 log10 decrease in lung viral loads was achieved, with the loads in some animals under the limit of detection of a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay. The conferred protection also avoided largely pulmonary inflammation.

We confirmed the vaccine efficacy and inhibition of lung inflammation using both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms in golden hamsters, naturally permissive to SARS-CoV2 replication and restituting human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our results provide the proof-of-principle evidence of marked prophylactic effects of an LV-based vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2 in two pre-clinical animal models and designate the intranasal LV::SFL-based immunization as a vigorous and promising vaccine approach against COVID-19.","MAJLESSI, L.; Ku, M.-W.; Bourgine, M.; Authie, P.; Lopez, J.; Nemirov, K.; Moncoq, F.; Noirat, A.; Vesin, B.; Nevo, F.; Blanc, C.; Souque, P.; Simon, E.; Tabbal, H.; Mouquet, H.; Anna, F.; Martin, A.; Escriou, N.; Charneau, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.214049v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.214049v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,False
64,Multi-site co-mutations and 5'UTR CpG immunity escape drive the evolution of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the caused mortalities have been surging since the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral mutations emerge during the virus circulating in the population, which is shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we extensively analyzed 6698 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences with specific sample collection dates in NCBI database. We found that four mutations, i.e., 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, NSP12_c-14408-t, and S_a-23403-g, became the dominant variants and each of them represented nearly 100% of all virus sequences since the middle May, 2020. Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity.

65,Discovery of potential imaging and therapeutic targets for severe inflammation in COVID-19 patients,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 540,000 deaths globally. Hyperinflammation mediated by dysregulated monocyte/macrophage function is considered to be the key factor that triggers severe illness in COVID-19. However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. Herein, we suggest candidate targets for imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19 by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by integrating the surface target database and drug-target binding database with RNA-sequencing data of severe COVID-19, we identified CCR1 and FPR1 as surface and druggable targets for drug delivery as well as molecular imaging. Our results provide a resource for candidate targets in the development of specific imaging and therapy for COVID-19-related hyperinflammation.","Lee, H.; Im, H.-J.; Na, K.

66,Evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in cats and dogs from households in Italy,"SARS-CoV-2 originated in animals and is now easily transmitted between people. Sporadic detection of natural cases in animals alongside successful experimental infections of pets, such as cats, ferrets and dogs, raises questions about the susceptibility of animals under natural conditions of pet ownership. Here we report a large-scale study to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection in 817 companion animals living in northern Italy, sampled at a time of frequent human infection. No animals tested PCR positive. However, 3.4% of dogs and 3.9% of cats had measurable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, with dogs from COVID-19 positive households being significantly more likely to test positive than those from COVID-19 negative households.

67,Implications of the COVID-19 lockdown on dengue transmission and the occurrence of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in Malaysia,"The impact of movement restrictions (MRs) during the COVID-19 lockdown on the existing endemic infectious disease dengue fever has generated considerable research interest. We compared the curve of weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no MRs and found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes, we proposed a stronger diffusive effect of vector dispersal that led to a higher rate of transmission. From the result of the Aedes survey using human landing caught (HLC), we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments, with the abundance increasing steadily during the period of lockdown. We only recovered Aedes aegypti from the indoor environment, which is relatively fewer than Ae. albopictus, by contrasting their population growth, which suggested that Ae. albopictus invaded and colonized the habitat of Ae. aegypti during the period of lockdown. These findings would help authorities review the direction and efforts of the vector control strategy.

Author summaryCOVID-19 pandemic is taking hold globally and dengue fever transmission is not on the top of the list of concerns. With a partial lockdown implemented by Malaysia on 18 March, we postulate the movement restrictions (MRs) of people in large-scale would hamper the regular dengue transmission and aim to reveal the impact of MRs on both dengue incidences and Aedes mosquitoes. We showed a significant decline of dengue incidences at the beginning of lockdown but later rebounded at an earlier time and higher rate compared to the corresponding period of previous years. Our result also reviews how adaptive the Ae. albopictus with the movement of the host, as the human contained in the house, the abundance of the mosquitoes increased significantly during the period of lockdown. We also suggest that Ae. albopictus could be the key substitution vector that contributes significantly to dengue virus circulation, and therefore, the vector control direction and strategies should be redesigned.","Ong, S.-Q.; Ahmad, H.; Mohd.

68,Integrative Vectors for Regulated Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Implicated in RNA Metabolism,"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to result in substantial reorganization of host cell RNA metabolism. We identified 14 proteins that were predicted to interact with host RNAs or RNA binding proteins, based on published data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a series of affinity-tagged and codon-optimized expression constructs for each of these 14 proteins. Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His8, the C-terminus with His8-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the HEK293 Flp-In TREx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins and quantified by western blot. A few fusion proteins were poorly expressed, whereas others, including Nsp1, Nsp12, and N protein, were toxic unless care was taken to minimize background expression. All plasmids can be obtained from Addgene and cell lines are available. We anticipate that availability of these resources will facilitate a more detailed understanding of coronavirus molecular biology.","Bresson, S.; Robertson, N.; Sani, E.; Turowski, T.

69,S protein-reactive IgG and memory B cell production after human SARS-CoV-2 infection includes broad reactivity to the S2 subunit,"The high susceptibility of humans to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19, reflects the novelty of the virus and limited preexisting B cell immunity. IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBCs. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 in convalescent subjects were higher than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.

IMPORTANCERecent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key questions are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre- and post-infection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.","Nguyen-Contant, P.; Embong, A.

70,Evaluation of a novel multiplexed assay for determining IgG levels and functional activity to SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of new serological assays that could aid in diagnosis and evaluation of seroprevalence to inform an understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease. Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay.

MethodsA multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019.

ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4% and sensitivity of 96.2% for samples taken 14 days and 97.9% for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay.

ConclusionExcellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality.","Johnson, M.; Wagstaffe, H.; Gilmour, K.

Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species except mouse to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing spike protein derived from either the bat raTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 Spike displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Strikingly, insertion of PRRA into the raTG13 Spike selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but conferred usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13 spike proteins.","Liu, S.; Selvaraj, P.; Lien, C.; Wu, W.

The acute phase was characterized by a rapid migration of CD16+ monocytes from the blood and concomitant increase in CD16+ macrophages in the lungs. We identified two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA- DR+ CD206-), a transitional CD11c+ CD16+ population that was directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and one long lasting CD11b+ CD16+ population. Strikingly, monocytes were a correlate of viral replication in bronchial brushes and levels of TARC (CCL17), and worse disease outcomes were associated with high levels of cell infiltration in lungs and CD11b+ CD16+ macrophages accumulation. Importantly, this accumulation was long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with less signs of disease had a high IL-10:IL-6 ratio.

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThe molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.

ResultsAll observed phylogenetic signals were very low and consistent trees were obtained. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to range from 1.37 to 2.19 x 10-3 substitution/site/year.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understanding essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow identifying the best targets for antiviral treatments and vaccines development.","Pereson, M. J.; Mojsiejczuk, L.; Martinez, A. P.; Flichman, D. M.; Garcia, G.

This assumes a great significance in the context of the current COVD-19 pandemic, as there are chances of aerosol-borne disease transmission in orthopedic surgical procedures. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis will be undertaken to assimilate and analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in orthopedic surgical procedures and their significance with respect to SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission.

75,"Time between Symptom Onset, Hospitalisation and Recovery or Death: a Statistical Analysis of Different Time-Delay Distributions in Belgian COVID-19 Patients","Background There are different patterns in the COVID-19 outbreak in the general population and amongst nursing home patients. Different age-groups are also impacted differently. However, it remains unclear whether the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and hospitalization or the length of stay in the hospital is different for different age groups, gender, residence place or whether it is time dependent. Methods Sciensano, the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health, collected information on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 hospital admissions from 114 participating hospitals in Belgium. Between March 14, 2020 and June 12, 2020, a total of 14,618 COVID-19 patients were registered. The time of symptom onset, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, time of hospitalization, time of recovery or death, and length of stay in intensive care are recorded. The distributions of these different event times for different age groups are estimated accounting for interval censoring and right truncation in the observed data. Results The truncated and interval-censored Weibull regression model is the best model for the time between symptom onset and diagnosis/hospitalization best, whereas the length of stay in hospital is best described by a truncated and interval-censored lognormal regression model. Conclusions The time between symptom onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and diagnosis are very similar, with median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days, depending on the age of the patient and whether or not the patient lives in a nursing home. Patients coming from a nursing home facility have a slightly prolonged time between symptom onset and hospitalization (i.e., 2 days). The longest delay time is observed in the age group 20-60 years old. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis follows the same trend, but on average is one day longer as compared to the time to hospitalization. The median length of stay in hospital varies between 3 and 10.4 days, with the length of stay increasing with age. However, a difference is observed between patients that recover and patients that die. While the hospital length of stay for patients that recover increases with age, we observe the longest time between hospitalization and death in the age group 20-60. And, while the hospital length of stay for patients that recover is shorter for patients living in a nursing home, the time from hospitalization to death is longer for these patients. But, over the course of the first wave, the length of stay has decreased, with a decrease in median length of stay of around 2 days.","Faes, C.; Abrams, S.; Van Beckhoven, D.; Meyfroidt, G.; Vlieghe, E.; Hens, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156307v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156307v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
76,Aerosol filtering efficiency of respiratory face masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, effected the imposition of personal protection measures in a large number of countries. The use of commercially available personal face masks was widely accepted as such a protective measure. Since the quality of the face masks scanned the spectrum from surgical to the home made fabric ones, it was considered appropriate to experimentally establish their effectiveness for stopping aerosol in entering the respiratory system of the bearer. Presently, the masks were tested with polydisperse indoor air. Their effectiveness was examined for aerosol of aerodynamic diameters of 0.006 m to 10 m. Of these masks, only two were effective for the whole range of aerosol. Cloth masks were found to be ineffective for the whole spectrum of aerosol particle sizes and especially in SARS-CoV-2 virus most abundant size range.","Loupa, G.; Karali, D.; RAPSOMANIKIS, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155119v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155119v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
77,COVID-19 DEATH TOLL: THE ROLE OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,"Background: Several months into the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a limited understanding of the underlying country-specific factors associated with COVID-19 spread and mortality. This study aims to investigate the role of nations' economic development in the death toll associated with COVID-19 in Europe and Israel. Methods: Number of COVID-19 cases, deaths per million, and case fatality rate (CFR) in Israel and 39 countries in Europe were described across quintiles of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The association between GDP per capita and COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and CFR was investigated using generalized linear modeling adjusting for the proportion of elderly and density of the population. Results: In countries belonging to the three lower GDP quintiles, COVID-19 incidence rates per million (range 708-1134) were substantially lower compared to countries in the fourth (3939) and fifth (3476) quintiles. Major differences were also calculated in COVID-19 mortality rates per million (25-31 vs. 222-268). There was no significant (p=0.19) differences in CFR between GDP quintiles (range: 2.79-7.62%). Conclusions: COVID-19 had a greater toll in more developed nations. Though comparisons are limited by differences in testing, reporting and lockdown policies, this association likely reflects increased spread from trade and tourism in wealthier countries, whereas limited health system capacity and lack of treatment and vaccination options contributed to higher than expected CFR in wealthier countries. This unique situation will probably encourage the stronger economies to invest the required financial capacity to respond to and recover from the current crisis.","Chodcik, G.; Weil, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156778v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156778v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
78,"SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada, January 1-July 6, 2020","Objective: To investigate COVID-19 epidemiology in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, Canada. Methods: We calculated the incidence rate ratio (January 1-July 6, 2020) between the 3 provinces, and estimated time-varying reproduction number, Rt, starting from March 1, using EpiEstim package in R. Results: Using British Columbia as a reference, the incidence rate ratios in Alberta and Ontario are 3.1 and 4.3 among females, and 3.4 and 4.0 among males. In Ontario, Rt fluctuated ~1 in March, reached values >1 in early and mid-April, then dropped <1 in late April and early May. Rt rose to ~1 in mid-May and then remained <1 from late May through early July. In British Columbia, Rt dropped <1 in early April, but it increased towards the end of April. Rt <1 in May while it fluctuated around 1.0 in June and early July. In Alberta, Rt > 1 in March; Rt dropped in early April and rose again in late April. In much of May, Rt <1, but Rt increases in early June and fluctuates ~1 since mid-June. Conclusions: Rt wavering around 1.0 indicated that three provinces of Canada have managed to achieve limited onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as of early July 2020.","Fung, I. C.-H.; Hung, Y.

79,Do low TB prevalence or lack of BCG VaccinationContribute to Emergence Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome?,"Background: Emergence of new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is thought to be associated with COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 morbidity and mortality variances among countries has been suggested by previous works to be influenced BCG and previous Latent TB infection (which is reflected by TB prevalence) by possible inducing heterogeneous immunity against SARS-COV2. Aim: To examine influence of BCG status and TB prevalence on variances among countries which register new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Methods: We choose all countries which report MIS-C till 23/6/2020, number of cases for each 10 million capita was examined among 3 categories of countries classified according to BCG program status. TB prevalence, MIS-C no. / 10 million (M) and Covid- 19 deaths/M are taken as markers. Receiver operation characteristic - (ROC) curve, as well as some relative indicators such as (sensitivity and specificity rates), estimation area of trade - off between sensitivity and specificity, and cutoff points are used for discriminating different three pairs of countries (which have different BCG practices). Discrimination of these categories done through studied markers. 95% confidence interval of all probable combinations pairs had been measured. Results: MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.000 with a symbiotic significant of 0.034 and (95% CI interval of 0.000-0.000) also MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries not currently give BCG vaccination ( with previous mass vaccination programs) vs countries currently give mass vaccination shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.094 with a symbiotic significant of 0.027and ( 95% CI interval of 0.000 -0.280) Important not significant finding in MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries not currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.583 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683 and (95% CI interval of 0.074-0.759). Countries not currently give vaccine make discrimination in other pairs COVID-19 deaths M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.083 with a symbiotic informative and reportable value of 0.077 and (95% CI interval of 0.000-0.309 also COVID-19 deaths M capita in countries not currently give BCG vaccination vs countries currently giving vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.188 with a symbiotic informative reportable value of 0.089 and ( 95% CI interval of 0.000-0.452). Important finding is the not significant association in COVID-19 deaths /M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries not currently giving vaccine area under ROC- curve equal to 0.417 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683 and (95% CI interval of 0.078 - 0.755). Countries not currently giving vaccine make discrimination in third pair of countries in significant association and not in 1st pair. Regarding TB prevalence marker or discriminator the areas under curve were informative and reportable and too generating with the leftover markers in all 3 pairs signifying inverse relations with covide-19 mortality and MIS-C no. curves . Conclusion: BCG vaccinations and high TB prevalence are found in this study to be related to decrease MIS-C and COVID-19 deaths this might explain variances among countries worldwide. Further studies to confirm this relations and possible relations with other epidemics is recommended. Review of TB programs in relation to treat latent asymptomatic infections and initiate and consolidate BCG programs should be considered urgently.","Raham, T.

81,A New Mathematical Approach for the Estimation of epidemic Model Parameters with Demonstration on COVID-19 Pandemic in Libya,"Background: The SEIR model or a variation of it is commonly used to study epidemic spread and make predictions on how it evolves. It is used to guide officials in their response to an epidemic. This research demonstrates an effective and simple approach that estimates the parameters of any variations of the SEIR model. This new technique will be demonstrated on the spread of COVID-19 in Libya. Methods: A five compartmental epidemic model is used to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. Two sets of data are needed to evaluate the model parameters, the cumulative number of symptomatic cases and the total number of active cases. This data along with the assumption that the cumulative number of symptomatic cases grows exponentially, to determine most of the model parameters. Results: Libya epidemic start-date was estimated as t_o=-18.5 days, corresponding to May 5th. We mathematically demonstrated that the number of active cases follows two competing exponential distributions: a positive exponential function, measuring how many new cases are added, and a negative exponential function, measuring how many cases recovered. From this distribution we showed that the average recovery time is 48 days, and the incubation period is 15.2 days. Finally, the productive number was estimated as R0 = 7.6. Conclusions: With only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of COVID19, several important SEIR model parameters can be measured effectively. This approach can be applied for any infectious disease epidemic anywhere in the world.","Saleh, M. E.; Saleh, Z.

82,Explainable-Machine-Learning to discover drivers and to predict mental illness during COVID-19,"COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the global economy, education, and travel and stranded people in their respective zones. Most importantly, it has claimed more than half a million lives and is poised to create long and short term consequences through mental health impairment. Identification of important factors affecting mental health can help people manage emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Here, we focus on identifying factors that have a significant impact on mental health during COVID pandemics. In this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the level of mental health. Overall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that people with the chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders during COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of communication with family/friends/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy.","Jha, I.

Preliminary Results","Community-level seroprevalence surveys are needed to determine the proportion of the population with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a necessary component of COVID-19 disease surveillance. In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%). People who self-identified as not believing they had COVID-19 had the lowest prevalence 4.8% (95% CI 2.3%, 8.2%). The range of seroprevalence after correction for potential selection bias was 21.9% to 24.2%. This study suggests more than 80% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were not reported.

However, little is known regarding the systematic review of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. The current study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS CoV 2 RNA positivity after recovery from COVID 19 and to determine the factors associated with recurrent positivity. Methods: We searched the PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Results: Fourteen studies of 2,568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.44-18.19%). The pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.44 days (95% CI: 32.65-38.24 days), and from the last negative to recurrent positive result was 9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31-12.22 days). Patients with younger age (mean difference [MD]=-2.27, 95% CI: -2.95 to -1.80) and a longer initial illness (MD=8.24 days; 95% CI: 7.54-8.95; I2=98.9%) were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes (RR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; I2=53%), severe disease (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; I2=70%), and a low lymphocyte count (RR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.39-0.86; I2=48%) were less likely to experience recurrent SARS CoV 2 positivity.

88,Disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India,"Background. Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each state and union territory (UT) of India has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state and union territory governments. This assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting by other governments. Methods. We designed a semi-quantitative framework to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the states and union territories of India. This framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We then used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0 to 1) for 29 states based on the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state during the two-week period from 19 May to 1 June, 2020. States that reported less than 10 total confirmed cases as of May 18 were excluded from the study. Findings. Our results indicate a strong disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state governments in India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Only ten states provide a visual representation of the trend in COVID-19 data. Ten states do not report any data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by releasing their personally identifiable information on the official websites. Across the states, the CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630, p=0.0003). Interpretation. The disparity in CDRS across states highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states in India. Coordination among states is particularly important as more people start moving across states in the coming months. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence. Funding.

89,Sleepless in Lockdown: unpacking differences in sleep loss during the coronavirus pandemicin the UK,"Background: Covid-19 has been shown to be having a disproportionate impact on the health of individuals from different ethnic groups and those employed in certain occupations, whilst the indirect impacts of Covid-19, including the closure of schools and business and the move to home working, fall disproportionately on the young and on women. These factors may in turn impact upon sleep health. Research on sleep deprivation during the pandemic crisis to date has been limited. The present study aimed to explore the levels and social determinants of self-reported sleep loss among the general population during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, with a particular focus on ethnic and gender disparities. Methods: Newly available national representative survey data from Understanding Society COVID19 Study collected during April 2020 were analysed. These data were linked to Wave 9 of Understanding Society conducted in 2018/19, providing information about the respondents prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Cross-sectional analysis provided prevalence estimates, whilst analysis of the linked longitudinal data provided incidence estimates. The analytical sample included 15,360 respondents aged 16 and above; among these, 12,206 reported no problem of sleep loss before the epidemic. Results: Prevalence and incidence rates of perceived sleep loss were 24.7% and 20.2% respectively. Women (at the level of 31.8% and 27.0%) and individuals from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities (at the level of 32.0% and 24.6%) were more vulnerable to sleep deprivation due to the pandemic. Multivariate regression analysis shows that being female, the presence of young children in the household, perceived financial difficulties and being a Covid-19-related key worker were all predictive of sleep loss. Once these covariates were controlled for the bivariate relationship between ethnicity and sleep loss was reversed, reflecting the complex interaction between the coronavirus epidemic and ethnicity. Conclusions: The pandemic has widened the disparity of sleep deprivation across different groups, with women with young children, key workers and people of BAME heritage all experiencing difficulty in sleeping, which in turn may negatively affect mental and physical health and well-being.","Falkingham, J.; Evandrou, M.; Qin, M.; Vlachantoni, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157255v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157255v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True

Data were obtained from patients that were admitted to an HM hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 until 24/04/2020, excluding unconfirmed diagnosis, those who were admitted before the epidemic started in Madrid, had an outcome that was not discharge or death or died within 24 hours of presentation. We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16%) died and 311 (18.9%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In this multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and prednisone administration was found to be associated with improved outcomes. Other treatments were associated with no effect or worse outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.","Bernaola, N.; Mena, R.; Bernaola, A.; Lara, A.; Carballo, C.; Larranaga, P.; Bielza, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155960v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155960v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
92,Humoral Response Dynamics Following Infection with SARS-CoV-2,"Objectives To understand humoral dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection Design Prospective Cohort Study Setting Great Ormond Street Hospital (Central London Paediatric Hospital) Participants 67 healthcare workers aged >18 years who provided monthly serial serological samples from 29th April 2020 until 30th June 2020. Main outcome measures The change in monthly serial antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), spike protein and the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Results The mean estimated half-life of the nucleoprotein antibody was 52 days (95% CI 42-65). The spike and RBD antibody had significantly longer mean half-lives of 81 days (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI 55-137) respectively. An ACE-2 receptor competition assay demonstrated significant correlation between the spike and RBD antibody titers and ACE2 receptor blocking in-vitro. The time to a negative nucleoprotein antibody test for 50% of the seropositive population was predicted to be 195 days (95% CI 163-236). Conclusions After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the predicted half-life of nucleoprotein antibody was 52 days with 50% of seropositives becoming seronegative to this antibody at 195 days. Widely used serological tests including the Public Health England endorsed assay that depend on the nucleoprotein antibody will therefore underestimate the true prevalence of infection within a year following the majority of infections.","Grandjean, L.; Saso, A.; Ortiz, A.; Lam, T.; Hatcher, J.; Thistlethwaite, R.; Harris, M.; Best, T.; Johnson, M.; Wagstaffe, H.; Ralph, E.; Mai, A.; Colijn, C.; Breuer, J.; Buckland, M.; Gilmour, K.; Goldblatt, D.; The Co-Stars Study Team,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155663v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155663v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
93,"A global survey on changes in the supply, price and use of illicit drugs and alcohol, and related complications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","Background and aims: COVID-19 has infected more than 13 million people worldwide and impacted the lives of many more, with a particularly devastating impact on vulnerable populations, including people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Quarantines, travel bans, regulatory changes, social distancing and 'lockdown' measures have affected drug and alcohol supply chains and subsequently their availability, price and use patterns, with possible downstream effects on presentations of SUDs and demand for treatment. Given the lack of multicentric epidemiologic studies, we conducted a rapid global survey within the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) network in order to understand the status of substance-use patterns during the current pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Worldwide. Participants: Starting on April 4th, 2020 during a 5-week period, the survey received 185 responses from 77 countries. Measurements: To assess addiction medicine professionals' perceived changes in drug and alcohol supply, price, use pattern and related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Participants reported (among who answered ''decreased'' or ''increased'', percentage of those who were in majority is reported in the parenthesis) a decrease in drug supply (69.0%), and at the same time an increase in price (95.3%) globally. With respect to changes in use patterns, an increase in alcohol (71.7%), cannabis (63.0%), prescription opioids (70.9%), and sedative/hypnotics (84.6%) use was reported while the use of amphetamines (59.7%), cocaine (67.5%), and opiates (58.2%) was reported to decrease overall. Conclusions: The global report on changes in the availability, use patterns and complications of alcohol and drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered in making new policies and in developing mitigating measures and guidelines during the current pandemic (and probable future ones) in order to minimize risks to SUDs.

94,"The COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan, China: epidemiology and impact of interventions","In January 2020, a COVID19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of the performed interventions. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. Severity of symptoms increased with age. We estimated R0 at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6-3.7). The epidemic was self sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95%CI: 31-68 days), causing 9,216 (95%CI: 1,317-25,545) more cases and possibly overwhelming Sichuan healthcare system.","Liu, Q.; Bento, A.

95,Changes in Emergency Department attendances before and after COVID-19 lockdown implementation: a cross sectional study of one urban NHS Hospital Trust,"Background Emergency Department (ED) attendances have fallen across the UK since the ""lockdown"" introduced on 23rd March 2020 to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We hypothesised that reductions would vary by patient age and disease type. We examined pre- and in-lockdown ED attendances for two COVID-19 unrelated diagnoses; one likely to be affected by lockdown measures (gastroenteritis) and one likely to be unaffected (appendicitis). Methods Retrospective cross-sectional study conducted across two EDs in one London hospital Trust. We compared all adult and paediatric ED attendances, before (January 2020) and during lockdown (March/April 2020). Key patient demographics, method of arrival and discharge location were compared. We used SNOMED codes to define attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. Results ED attendances fell from 1129 per day before lockdown to 584 in-lockdown; 51.7% of pre-lockdown rates. In-lockdown attendances were lowest for under-18s (16.0% of pre-lockdown). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital increased from 17.3% to 24.0% and the proportion admitted to intensive care increased four-fold. Attendances for gastroenteritis fell from 511 to 103; 20.2% of pre-lockdown rates. Attendances for appendicitis also decreased, from 144 to 41; 28.5% of pre-lockdown rates. Conclusion ED attendances fell substantially following lockdown implementation. The biggest reduction was for under-18s. We observed reductions in attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. This may reflect lower rates of infectious disease transmission, though the fall in appendicitis-related attendances suggests that behavioural factors are also important. Larger studies are urgently needed to understand changing patterns of ED use and access to emergency care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Honeyford, K.; Coughlan, C.; Expert, P.; Burcea, G.; Maconochie, I.; Kinderlerer, A.; Cooke, G.

96,Adjunctive Corticosteroids for COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in the management of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults ([&ge;]18 years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were given treatment. Treatment included hydroxycholoroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir. Corticosteroids were included as adjunctive therapy in mid-April, 2020. We compared composite outcomes of clinical progression and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) or death between group that received treatment only (Group A) versus group that received adjunctive corticosteroids (Group B). Entropy balancing was used to generate stabilized weight for covariates between treatment groups. Unweighted Kaplan-Meir curves, weighted and adjusted Cox regression analysis were used to estimate effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on composite outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed on those with pneumonia. Results: Of 1046 patients with COVID-19, 57 received treatment alone (Group A) and 35 received adjunctive corticosteroids in addition to treatment (Group B). Median day of illness at treatment initiation was 5 day. There were 44 patients with pneumonia; 68.9% of them were not requiring supplemental oxygen at treatment initiation. Overall, 17 (18.5%) of 92 patients had clinical progression including 13 (22.8%) of 57 patients in Group A versus 4 (11.4%) of 35 patients in Group B (p=0.172). Unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed no significant difference in the proportion of patients who had clinical progression or invasive MV or death between the 2 treatment groups. However in those with pneumonia, there were lower proportions of patients in Group B with clinical progression (11.1% , 95% CI 0.0 - 22.2 versus 58.8%, 95% CI 27.3 - 76.7, log rank p<0.001 ); and invasive MV or death (11.3%, 95% CI 0.0 - 22.5 versus 41.2%, 95% CI 12.4. - 60.5, log rank p=0.016). In weighted and adjusted cox regression analysis, patients in Group B were less likely to have clinical progression, (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.99, p=0.049) but there was no statistical significant difference in risk of requiring invasive MV or death (aHR 0.22, 95%CI 0.02 - 2.54, p=0.22). In subgroup with pneumonia, patients in Group B were significantly at lower risk of clinical progression (aHR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.39, p<0.001) and requiring invasive MV compared to Group A (aHR 0.30, 0.10-0.87, p=0.029). Conclusions: Use of adjunctive corticosteroids is associated with lower risk of clinical progression and invasive MV or death, especially in those with pneumonia. Concurrent use of antivirals and corticosteroids should be considered in the management of COVID-19 related pneumonia.","Ooi, S. T.; Parthasarathy, P.; Lin, Y.; Nallakaruppan, V.; Ng, S.; Tan, T.

97,Preliminary optimisation of a simplified sample preparation method to permit direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 within saliva samples using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP),"We describe the optimization of a simplified sample preparation method which permits rapid and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within saliva using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Treatment of saliva samples prior to RT-LAMP by dilution 1:1 in MucolyseTM, followed by dilution (within the range of 1 in 5 to 1 in 40) in 10% (w/v) Chelex 100 Resin and a 98oC heat step for 2 minutes enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all positive saliva samples tested, with no amplification detected in pooled negative saliva. The time to positivity for which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in these positive saliva samples was proportional to the real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR cycle threshold (CT), with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in as little as 05:43 (CT 21.08), 07:59 (CT 24.47) and 08:35 (CT 25.27) minutes, respectively. The highest CT where direct RT-LAMP detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 31.39 corresponding to a 1 in 40 dilution of a positive saliva sample (1:1 in MucolyseTM) with a starting CT of 25.27. When RT-LAMP was performed on pools of SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva samples spiked with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, RNA was detected at dilutions spanning 1 in 5 to 1 in 160 representing CTs spanning 22.49-26.43. Here we describe a simple but critical rapid sample preparation method which can be used up front of RT-LAMP to permit direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 within saliva samples. Saliva is a sample which can be collected non-invasively without the use of highly skilled staff and critically can be obtained from both healthcare and home settings. Critically, this approach overcomes both the requirement and validation of different swabs and the global bottleneck in obtaining RNA extraction robots and reagents to enable molecular testing by PCR. Such testing opens the possibility of public health approaches for effective intervention to control the COVID-19 pandemic through regular SARS-CoV-2 testing at a population scale, combined with isolation and contact tracing for positive cases.","Howson, E.; Kidd, S.; Sawyer, J.; Cassar, C.; Cross, D.; Lewis, T.; Hockey, J.; Rivers, S.; Cawthraw, S.; Banyard, A.; Anderson, P.; Rahou, S.; Andreou, M.; Morant, N.; Clarke, D.; Walsh, C.; Laxman, S.; Houghton, R.; Slater-Jefferies, J.; Costello, P.; Brown, I.; Cortes, N.; Godfrey, K.; FOWLER, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155168v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155168v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
98,Neutralizing and binding antibody kinetics of COVID-19 patients during hospital and convalescent phases,"Knowledge of the host immune response after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for informing directions of vaccination and epidemiological control strategies against COVID-19. In this study, thirty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 244 serial blood specimens (38.1% after hospital discharge) collected to explore the chronological evolution of neutralizing (NAb), total (TAb), IgM, IgG and IgA antibody in parallel. IgG titers reached a peak later (approximately 35 days postonset) than those of Nab, Ab, IgM and IgA (20~25 days postonset). After peaking, IgM levels declined with an estimated average half-life of 10.36 days, which was more rapid than those of IgA (51.25 days) and IgG (177.39 days). Based on these half-life data, we estimate that the median times for IgM, IgA and IgG to become seronegative are 4.59 (IQR 4.12-5.03), 7.78 (IQR 6.71-9.16) and 42.72 (IQR 33.75-47.96) months post disease onset. The relative contribution of IgM to NAb was higher than that of IgG (standardized {beta} regression coefficient: 0.53 vs 0.48), so the rapid decline in NAb may be attributed to the rapid decay of IgM in acute phase. However, the relative contribution of IgG to NAb increased and that of IgM further decreased after 6 weeks postonset. It's assumed that the decline rate of NAb might slow down to the same level as that of IgG over time. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses in patients and that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquired by infection may persist for a relatively long time.","Yao, X.-Y.; Liu, W.; Li, Z.-Y.; Xiong, H.-L.; Su, Y.-Y.; Li, T.; Zhang, S.-Y.; Zhang, X.-J.; Bi, Z.-F.; Deng, C.-X.; Li, C.-Y.; Yuan, Q.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, T.-Y.; Wang, Z.-X.; Ge, S.-x.; Ningshao, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156810v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156810v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
99,Transparency Assessment of COVID-19 Models,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major societal unrest, modelers have worked to project future trends of COVID-19 and predict upcoming challenges and impacts of policy action. These models, alone or in aggregate, are influential for decision-makers at every level. Therefore, the method and documentation of COVID-19 models must be highly transparent to ensure that projections and consequential policies put forth have sound epistemological grounds. We evaluated 29 COVID-19 models receiving high attention levels within the scientific community and/or informing government responses. We evaluated these models against 27 transparency criteria. We found high levels of transparency in model documentation aspects such as reporting uncertainty analysis; however, about half of the models do not share code and a quarter do not report equations. These discrepancies underscore the need for transparency and reproducibility to be at the forefront of researchers' priorities, especially during a global health crisis when stakes are critically high.","Jalali, M.

100,The Effect of GDP and Distance on Timing of COVID-19 Spread in Chinese Provinces in 2020,"The geographical spread of COVID-19 across China's provinces provides the opportunity for retrospective analysis on contributors to the timing of the spread. Highly contagious diseases need to be seeded into populations and we hypothesized that greater distance from the epicenter in Wuhan, as well as higher province-level GDP per capita, would delay the time until a province detected COVID-19 cases. To test this hypothesis, we used province-level socioeconomic data such as GDP per capita and percentage of the population aged over 65, distance from the Wuhan epicenter, and health systems capacity in a Cox proportional hazards analysis of the determinants of each province's time until epidemic start. The start was defined by the number of days it took for each province to reach thresholds of 3, 5, 10, or 100 cases. We controlled for the number of hospital beds and physicians as these could influence the speed of case detection. Surprisingly, none of the explanatory variables had a statistically significant effect on the time it took for each province to get its first cases; the timing of COVID-19 spread appears to have been random with respect to distance, GDP, demography, and the strength of the health system. Looking to other factors, such as travel, policy, and lockdown measures, could provide additional insights on realizing most critical factors in the timing of spread.","Kuan, A.; Chen, M.; Bishai, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157354v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157354v1?rss=1,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,,True
101,"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes for 7,995 Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide. Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Design: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. Setting: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. Populations: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Main outcome and performance measures: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. Results: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 1633 (75.8%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 192 (11.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 227 (13.5%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 81.9 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14-1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50-2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Conclusions: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Ongoing studies will be needed to continue to evaluate these risks, particularly in the setting of evolving treatment guidelines.","McPadden, J.; Warner, F.; Young, H. P.; Hurley, N. C.; Pulk, R.

102,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through cGAS-STING and NF-κB,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic. In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-{kappa}B and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-{kappa}B response is mediated by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-{kappa}B driven inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to suppress severe disease symptoms.","Neufeldt, C.

103,An Optimization Framework to Study the Balance Between Expected Fatalities due to COVID-19 and the Reopening of U.S. Communities,"As communities reopen following shelter-in-place orders, they are facing two conflicting objectives. The first is to keep the COVID-19 fatality rate down. The second is to revive the U.S. economy and the livelihood of millions of Americans. In this paper, a team of researchers from the Center on Stochastic Modeling, Optimization, & Statistics (COSMOS) at the University of Texas at Arlington, in collaboration with researchers from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, has formulated a computationally-efficient optimization framework, referred to as COSMOS COVID-19 Linear Programming (CC19LP), to study the delicate balance between the expected fatality rate and the level of normalcy in the community. Given the disproportionate fatality characteristics of COVID-19 among those in different age groups or with an underlying medical condition or those living with crowding, the key to the CC19LP framework is a focus on ""key contacts"" that separate individuals at higher risk from the rest of the population. The philosophy of CC19LP lies in maximizing protection of key contacts, so as to shield high-risk individuals from infection. Given the lack of pharmaceutical solutions, i.e., a vaccine or cure, the CC19LP framework minimizes expected fatalities by optimizing the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, namely COVID-19 testing; personal protective equipment; and social precautions, such as distancing, hand-washing, and face coverings. Low-risk individuals that are not key contacts, including most children, are unrestricted and can choose to participate in pre-pandemic normal activities, which eliminates the need for compliance across the entire population. Consequently, the CC19LP framework demonstrates optimal strategies for protecting high-risk individuals while reopening communities.","Chen, V. C.

104,The brief comparison of the operational efficiency of pool-testing strategies for COVID-19 mass testing in PCR laboratories,"This paper addresses the operational efficiency of different pool-testing strategies in typical scenarios of a PCR laboratory working in mass testing for COVID-19 with different values of prevalence, limitations and conditions of testing, and priorities of optimization. The research employs a model of the laboratory's testing process, created after interviewing of PCR laboratories and studying their operations. The limitations and operational characteristics of this model were applied in a simulation of the testing process with different pool-testing strategies managed by a computer program developed in the LOMT project. The efficiency indicators assessed are the number of assays needed to obtain results of a batch of specimens, the number of specimens identified after the first analysis, and total time to obtain all results. Depending on prevalence, constraints of testing, and priorities of optimization, different pool-testing strategies provide the best operational efficiency. The binary splitting algorithm provides the maximum reduction of the number of assays: from 1.99x reduction for a high prevalence (10%) to 25x reduction for a low prevalence (0.1%), while other algorithms provide the least amount of time to obtain results or the maximum number of the specimens classified after the first analysis.","Vechera, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151415v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151415v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,True
105,A student made MOOC for medical students during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,Background: Latin America was one of the last regions of the world to become affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a response to the emergency virtual education was implemented in almost every country of the region. Methods: a massive open online course about epilepsy was made using only free software and platforms following the international league against epilepsy competence-based domains for epileptology teaching. Results: 250 healthcare students signed up for the course and only 17.2% of them had previously participated in courses like this one. This course had a completion rate of 37.2% and of the students that completed the course 98.3% would participate in course like this in the future. Conclusion: In conclusion MOOCs can be easily implemented as a powerful pedagogic strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and can have a positive impact not only in in its proposed learning objectives but it can help closing the gap that prevent Latin American healthcare students to acquire actively knowledge trough them.,"Ramirez, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146654v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146654v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,True
106,Providing breastfeeding support during the COVID-19 pandemic: Concerns of mothers who contacted the Australian Breastfeeding Association,"Concerns of mothers seeking breastfeeding support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the experiences of Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) volunteers who assisted them, were explored via an online survey. Surveys were completed 16th March to 18th of May 2020 and described the COVID-19 related concerns of 340 individuals. One hundred and thirty six mothers (64%) sought support to protect their infants by continuing breastfeeding, increasing milk supply, or restarting breastfeeding. Mothers were commonly stressed, isolated and needing reassurance. Thirty four (10%) raised concerns about COVID-19 and breastfeeding safety. One hundred and twenty nine (61%) informed volunteers they were unable to access face-to-face health services because of fear or unavailability. Most common breastfeeding concerns were related to insufficient milk or weight gain, painful breasts, relactation, and reducing supplemental milk. Volunteers reported mothers were worried stress had reduced milk supply, that milk supply concerns were exacerbated by the inability to weigh infants, and that seeking medical treatment was being delayed. ABA volunteers stated they felt supported and confident assisting mothers while also expressing distress at mothers situation. ABAs role in emergency response should be recognised and national planning for infant and young child feeding in emergencies, must be urgently developed, funded, and implemented.","Hull, N.; Kam, R.

108,SARS-CoV2 spike protein displays biologically significant similarities with paramyxovirus surface proteins; a bioinformatics study,"Recent emergence of SARS-CoV2 and associated COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge for the scientific community. Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology, virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This  spike-fusion homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spikes T cell epitopes as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region. Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.","Ahmadi, E.; Zabihi, M.

Sequencing of this novel virus provides an opportunity to evaluate the genetic polymorphism present in the viral population. Herein, we analysed 173 sequences isolated from Indian patients and performed SNP linkage, clustering and phylogenetic analysis to understand the local genetic diversity. We found that the SNP linkages that lead to the identification of some global clades, do not hold true for the local clade classification. In addition to the unique cluster, established by another Indian study, we identified a new cluster (I-20D) that encompasses 28% of the analysed sequences. This cluster is defined by two linked variations - C22444T and C28854T. A detailed study of such polymorphisms can be useful for drug and vaccine development.","Das, D.; Akkipeddi, V. S. S. N.

110,Concurrent human antibody andTH1 type T-cell responses elicited by a COVID-19 RNA vaccine,"An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 COVID-19 vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 g of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 convalescent human serum panel (HCS). Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 g) to 3.5-fold (50 g) those of HCS. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had TH1 skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon (IFN){gamma} was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.","Sahin, U.; Muik, A.; Derhovanessian, E.; Vogler, I.; Kranz, L.

111,"Evaluation of diversity levels in HIV-1 virus integrase gene sequences, supporting the lack of target specificity of ivermectin versus the integrase-importin complex in SARS-CoV-2 infection","Therapies with new drugs have been appearing in tests worldwide as potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 virus replication. Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin, was reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon becoming the target of an international prospecting work (not yet published), with patients tested for COVID-19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, sars-cov-2 and the functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.","Felix, P.

112,A human disease model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and immune responses with a microengineered organ chip,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seriously endangers human health. There is an urgent need to build physiological relevant human models for deep understanding the complex organ-level disease processes and facilitating effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we first report the use of microengineered alveolus chip to create a human disease model of lung injury and immune responses induced by native SARS-CoV-2 at organ-level. This biomimetic system is able to reconstitute the key features of human alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells under microfluidic flow. The epithelial cells on chip showed higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells identified by viral spike protein expression. Transcriptional analysis showed distinct responses of two cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including activated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway in epithelium and activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in endothelium. Notably, in the presence of circulating immune cells, a series of alveolar pathological changes were observed, including the detachment of endothelial cells, recruitment of immune cells, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta} and TNF-). These new findings revealed a crucial role of immune cells in mediating lung injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with antiviral compound remdesivir could suppress viral copy and alleviate the disruption of alveolar barrier integrity induced by viral infection. This bioengineered human organ chip system can closely mirror human-relevant lung pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, not possible by other in vitro models, which provides a promising and alternative platform for COVID-19 research and preclinical trials.","Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Li, Z.; Guo, Y.; Yao, Y.; Li, M.; Tao, T.; Chen, W.; Han, J.; Liu, H.; Cui, K.; Zhang, X.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,False
113,"Initial experience in Mexico with convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a retrospective case series","Introduction: Hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in Mexico is high (32%) and as of today, effective treatment options are limited. More effective treatments that shorten hospital stay and reduce mortality are needed. Initial reports for the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 appear promising. We describe a case series of eight patients with impending respiratory failure, who underwent CP therapy. Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers > 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for > 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg/dL vs. 1.63 mg/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng/mL vs. 0.13 ng/mL). High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower, and a mild reduction of pulmonary infiltrates by chest X-ray was observed. Lastly, a reduction of viral load was after CP therapy was found. (log, median [IQR], 1.2 [0.70-2.20] vs. 0.25 [0.00-1.78]). We observed no adverse effects. Conclusions: CP could potentially be an effective therapeutic option for patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical benefit needs to be studied further through randomized controlled trials.","Martinez-Resendez, M.

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been integrated into the official therapeutic protocol against COVID-19 in China. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula newly developed and specifically optimized for the treatment of COVID-19. Therapeutic administration of QFPDT resulted in an improved cure rate in mild to critically-ill patients. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of QFPDT has been poorly understood. Furthermore, the feasibility of prophylactic use in uninfected individuals remain unconfirmed. We thus examined whether the administration of QFPDT at a dose lower than recommended for therapeutic use alters hematological and/or immunological measures in healthy individuals. We found that QFPDT elevates the plasma levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, TNF-, and IL-8, which are key mediators of acute inflammatory responses to ssRNA viruses. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. Our finding suggests that the pharmacological action of QFPDT is associated with the upregulation of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines despite its clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients. We should therefore be careful in its prophylactic use in uninfected individuals until we have a better understanding of the immunopharmacological action of QFPDT through further clinical studies with larger cohorts.","Kageyama, Y.; Aida, K.; Kawauchi, K.; Morimoto, M.; Ebisui, T.; Akiyama, T.; Nakamura, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20146175v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20146175v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,True
115,Interferons and viruses induce a novel primate-specific isoform dACE2 and not the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells. ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, primate-specific isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 N-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results reconcile current knowledge on ACE2 expression and suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to affect the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.","Onabajo, O.

Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and its subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome adopts alternative topologies inside cells and undergoes genome cyclization. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Most importantly, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch - that encircles the programmed ribosomal frame-shifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV virus and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","Ziv, O.; Price, J.; Shalamova, L.; Kamenova, T.; Goodfellow, I.; Weber, F.; Miska, E.

118,Computational optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-motif affinity for human ACE2,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the closely related SARS-CoV coronavirus enter cells by binding at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.","Polydorides, S.; Archontis, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,False

Results: Using rs2228145 (IL6R) to proxy effects of tocilizumab use, no association with very severe COVID-19 was found, but possibly an inverse association with hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.83 per standardized effect of higher soluble interleukin-6r, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.02). Using rs12916 (HMGCR) to proxy effects of statins use, an inverse association with very severe COVID-19 was found (OR 0.30 per standardized effect, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89). Using rs6743376 and rs1542176 to proxy effects of anakinra use, no associations with COVID-19 were found. Dexamethasone, instrumented by cortisol, was possibly inversely associated with very severe COVID-19 (OR 0.20 per standardized effect 95% CI 0.04 to 1.04). Conclusion: Our study provides some genetic validation for the use of both tocilizumab and statins in COVID-19, but not anakinra, whilst being consistent with the findings from the RECOVERY trial about dexamethasone. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms might facilitate re-purposing and development of effective treatments.","Schooling, C.

120,Probing the dynamic structure-function and structure-free energy relationships of the corona virus main protease with Biodynamics theory,"The SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro) is of major interest as an anti-viral drug target. Structure-based virtual screening efforts, fueled by a growing list of apo and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV/CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures, are underway in many labs. However, little is known about the dynamic enzyme mechanism, which is needed to inform both structure-based design and assay development. Here, we apply Biodynamics theory to characterize the structural dynamics of substrate-induced Mpro activation, and explore the implications thereof for efficacious inhibition under non-equilibrium conditions. The catalytic cycle (including tetrahedral intermediate formation and hydrolysis) is governed by concerted dynamic structural rearrangements of domain 3 and the m-shaped loop (residues 132-147) on which Cys145 (comprising the thiolate nucleophile and one-half of the oxyanion hole) and Gly143 reside (comprising the other half of the oxyanion hole). In particular: O_LIDomain 3 undergoes dynamic rigid-body rotations about the domain 2-3 linker, alternately visiting two conformational states (denoted as [Formula]).
C_LIO_LIThe Gly143-containing crest of the m-shaped loop (denoted as crest B) undergoes up and down translations in concert with the domain 3 rotations (denoted as [Formula], whereas the Cys145-containing crest (denoted as crest A) remains statically in the up position. The crest B translations are driven by conformational transitions within the rising leg of the loop (Lys137-Asn142).
C_LI

We propose that substrates associate to the [Formula] state, which promotes the [Formula] state, dimerization (denoted as [Formula]-substrate), and catalysis. The structure resets to the dynamic monomeric form upon dissociation of the N-terminal product. We describe the energetics of the aforementioned state transitions, and address the implications of our proposed mechanism for efficacious Mpro inhibition under native-like conditions.","Wan, H.; Aravamuthan, V.; Pearlstein, R.

121,Inverted covariate effects for mutated 2nd vs 1st waveCovid-19: high temperature spread biased for young,"(1) Background: Here, we characterize COVID-19 2nd waves, following a study presenting negative associations between 1st wave COVID-19 spread parameters and temperature; (2) Methods: Visual examinations of daily increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in 124 countries, determined 1st and 2nd waves in 28 countries; (3) Results: 1st wave spread rate increases with country mean elevation, temperature, time since wave onset, and median age. Spread rates decrease above 1000m, indicating high UV decrease spread rate. For 2nd waves, associations are opposite: viruses adapted to high temperature and to infect young populations. Earliest 2nd waves started April 5-7 at mutagenic high elevations (Armenia, Algeria). 2nd waves occurred also at warm-to-cold season transition (Argentina, Chile). Spread decreases in most (77%) countries. Death-to-total case ratios decrease during the 2nd wave, also when comparing with the same period for countries where the 1st wave is ongoing. In countries with late 1st wave onset, spread rates fit better 2nd than 1st wave-temperature patterns; In countries with ageing populations (examples: Japan, Sweden, Ukraine), 2nd waves only adapted to spread at higher temperatures, not to infect children. (4) Conclusions: 1st wave viruses evolved towards lower spread and mortality. 2nd wave mutant COVID-19 strain(s) adapted to higher temperature, infecting children and replace (also in cold conditions) 1st wave COVID-19 strains. Counterintuitively, low spread strains replace high spread strains, rendering prognostics and extrapolations uncertain.","Seligmann, H.; Iggui, S.; Rachdi, M.; Vuillerme, N.; Demongeot, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151878v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151878v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,True
122,"Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 reveals multiple lineages and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Lombardy, Italy","From February to April, 2020, Lombardy (Italy) was the area who worldwide registered the highest numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. By extensively analyzing 346 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we demonstrated the simultaneous circulation in Lombardy of two major viral lineages, likely derived from multiple introductions, occurring since the second half of January. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (five of them non-synonymous) characterized the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, none of them affecting N-glycosylation sites. These two lineages, and the presence of two well defined clusters inside Lineage 1, revealed that a sustained community transmission was ongoing way before the first COVID-19 case found in Lombardy.","Alteri, C.; Cento, V.; Piralla, A.; Costabile, V.; Tallarita, M.; Colagrossi, L.; Renica, S.; Giardina, F.; Novazzi, F.; Gaiarsa, S.; Matarazzo, E.; Antonello, M.; Vismara, C.; Fumagalli, R.; Epis, O.

123,The folate antagonist methotrexate diminishes replication of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and enhances the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture models,"The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.

SIGNIFICANCEO_LIMTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit {euro} or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions.
C_LIO_LIAdditional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2
C_LIO_LIRemdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone.
C_LIO_LICOVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.

124,A New Adaptive Logistic Model for Epidemics and the Resurgence of COVID-19 in the United States,"The Adaptive Logistic Model (ALM) of epidemics incorporates the results of infection mitigation effects on the course of an epidemic, and well describes the histories of the COVID-19 epidemics in many countries, including the United States. In particular, it is much more successful than is a basic logistic model. However, in the U.S. these mitigation efforts have recently been relaxed in many places, resulting in the second peak in infections that started in late May of 2020. In this paper the ALM is modified to account for the relaxation of these mitigation effects, leading to the Adaptive Logistic Model 2 (ALM-2). The ALM-2 is then used to understand quantitatively the second peak of COVID-19 cases. The ALM-2 is also successfully applied to the data on deaths even though they do not yet show a second peak.","Roberts, D.

125,The Infectious Nature of Patient-Generated SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may occur through multiple routes. We collected aerosol samples around six patients admitted into mixed acuity wards in April of 2020 to identify the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2. Measurements were made to characterize the size distribution of aerosol particles, and size-fractionated, aerosol samples were collected to assess the presence of infectious virus in particles sizes of >4.1 m, 1-4 m, and <1 m in the patient environment. Samples were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), cell culture, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all six rooms in all particle size fractions (>4.1 m, 1-4 m, and <1 m). Increases in viral RNA during cell culture of the virus from recovered aerosol samples demonstrated the presence of infectious, replicating virions in three <1 m aerosol samples (P<0.05). Viral replication of aerosol was also observed in the 1-4 m stage but did not reach statistical significance (0.05<P<0.10). Western blot and TEM analysis of these samples also showed evidence of viral proteins and intact virions. The infectious nature of aerosol collected in this study further suggests that airborne transmission of COVID-19 is possible, and that aerosol prevention measures are necessary to effectively stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Santarpia, J.

Here, we tested small molecule inhibitors that target membrane dynamics or lipid metabolism. Included were inhibitors of the PI3 kinase VPS34, which functions in autophagy, endocytosis and other processes; Orlistat, an inhibitor of lipases and fatty acid synthetase, is approved by the FDA as a treatment for obesity; and Triacsin C which inhibits long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. VPS34 inhibitors, Orlistat and Triacsin C inhibited virus growth in Vero E6 cells and in the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3, acting at a post-entry step in the virus replication cycle. Of these the VPS34 inhibitors exhibit the most potent activity.","Silvas, J. A.; Jureka, A. S.; Nicolini, A. M.; Chvatal, S. A.; Basler, C.

A pertinent and recent example where such strategy could be employed is in the fight against COVID-19. Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA approved antiviral compounds including Remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA(R)) coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in non-infected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners as well as in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.","Friman, T.; Chernobrovkin, A.; Martinez Molina, D.; Arnold, L.

129,Haplotype Explorer: an infection cluster visualization tool for spatiotemporal dissection of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases, including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions and time spans. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing an example of its visualization and features.

130,Dynamics and significance of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUND Characterizing the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and developing accurate serologic assays are needed for diagnostic purposes and estimating population-level seroprevalence. METHODS We measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. RESULTS Between 14-28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43, and NL63. CONCLUSIONS Among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a correlate of protective immunity.","Iyer, A. S.; Jones, F.

131,De novo design of modular and tunable allosteric biosensors,"Naturally occurring allosteric protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","Quijano-Rubio, A.; Yeh, H.-W.; Park, J.; Lee, H.; Langan, R.

132,Observational Study of Haloperidol in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,"Background: Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potential effective treatment for Covid-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We examined the association between haloperidol use and respiratory failure at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Data were obtained regarding all adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19 since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. We compared outcomes between patients who were exposed to haloperidol and those who were not, using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results: Of the 13,279 hospitalized adult patients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 667 patients (5.0%) were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 12,612 patients, 104 (0.8%) were exposed to haloperidol. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint of respiratory failure respectively occurred in 27 patients (26.0%) exposed to haloperidol and 1,700 patients (13.6%) who were not. Among survivors, the secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 26 patients (32.1%) who received haloperidol and 6,110 patients (55.3%) who did not. In the main analysis, there were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.97, p=0.772) and secondary (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.53, p=0.643) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, haloperidol use was not associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to hospital discharge home.

133,"COVID-19, Race, and Redlining","Discussion on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on African Americans has been at center stage since the outbreak of the epidemic in the United States. To present day, however, lack of race-disaggregated individual data has prevented a rigorous assessment of the extent of this phenomenon and the reasons why blacks may be particularly vulnerable to the disease. Using individual and georeferenced death data collected daily by the Cook County Medical Examiner, we provide first evidence that race does affect COVID-19 outcomes. The data confirm that in Cook County blacks are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 related deaths since - as of June 16, 2020 - they constitute 35 percent of the dead, so that they are dying at a rate 1.3 times higher than their population share. Furthermore, by combining the spatial distribution of mortality with the 1930s redlining maps for the Chicago area, we obtain a block group level panel dataset of weekly deaths over the period January 1, 2020-June 16, 2020, over which we establish that, after the outbreak of the epidemic, historically lower-graded neighborhoods display a sharper increase in mortality, driven by blacks, while no pre-treatment differences are detected. Thus, we uncover a persistence influence of the racial segregation induced by the discriminatory lending practices of the 1930s, by way of a diminished resilience of the black population to the shock represented by the COVID-19 outbreak. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main channels of transmission are socioeconomic status and household composition, whose influence is magnified in combination with a higher black share.","Bertocchi, G.; Dimico, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20148486v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20148486v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,True
134,Cryo-electron Microscopy and Exploratory Antisense Targeting of the 28-kDa Frameshift Stimulation Element from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome,"Drug discovery campaigns against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beginning to target the viral RNA genome1, 2. The frameshift stimulation element (FSE) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is required for balanced expression of essential viral proteins and is highly conserved, making it a potential candidate for antiviral targeting by small molecules and oligonucleotides3-6. To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation. To understand current limitations, we applied cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Ribosolve7 pipeline to determine a three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, validated through an RNA nanostructure tagging method. This is the smallest macromolecule (88 nt; 28 kDa) resolved by single-particle cryo-EM at subnanometer resolution to date. The tertiary structure model, defined to an estimated accuracy of 5.9 [A], presents a topologically complex fold in which the 5' end threads through a ring formed inside a three-stem pseudoknot. Our results suggest an updated model for SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting as well as binding sites that may be targeted by next generation ASOs and small molecules.","Zhang, K.; Zheludev, I. N.; Hagey, R.

135,High expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on tissue macrophages that may be targeted by virus SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been recognized as the binding receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that infects host cells, causing the development of the new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low/- regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. These data indicate that alveolar macrophages, as the frontline immune cells, may be directly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore need to be considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Song, X.; Hu, W.; Yu, H.; Zhao, L.; Zhao, Y.; Zhao, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.210120v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.210120v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,False
136,Lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice,"ABSTRACTVaccine and antiviral development against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease currently lacks a validated small animal model. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) by the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18 hACE2) represent a susceptible rodent model. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 6, with virus detected in lung airway epithelium and brain. K18 ACE2-transgenic mice produced a modest TH1/2/17 cytokine storm in the lung and spleen that peaked by day 2, and an extended chemokine storm that was detected in both lungs and brain. This chemokine storm was also detected in the brain at day 4. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice are, therefore, highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and represent a suitable animal model for the study of viral pathogenesis, and for identification and characterization of vaccines (prophylactic) and antivirals (therapeutics) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated severe COVID-19 disease.","Oladunni, F.; Park, J.-G.; Pino Tamayo, P.; Gonzalez, O.; Ahkter, A.; Allue Guardia, A.; Olmo-Fontanez, A.; Gautam, S.; Garcia Vilanova, A.; Ye, C.; Chiem, K.; Headley, C.; Dwivedi, V.; Parodi, L.; Alfson, K.; Staples, H.; Schami, A.; Garcia, J.; Whigham, A.; Platt, R.

137,An autocrine Vitamin D-driven Th1 shutdown program can be exploited for COVID-19,"Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-{gamma}-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5-7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","McGregor, R.; Chauss, D.; Freiwald, T.; Yan, B.; Wang, L.; Nova-Lamperti, E.; Zhang, Z.; Teague, H.; West, E.; Bibby, J.; Kelly, A.; Malik, A.; Freeman, A.; Schwartz, D.; Portilla, D.; John, S.; Lavender, P.; Lionakis, M.

Here, we describe a novel application of biolayer interferometry for the rapid detection of antigen-specific antibody levels in plasma samples, and demonstrate its utility for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated ""dip-and-read"" format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection. Complete quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 minutes. BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates. In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.","Dzimianski, J. V.; Lorig-Roach, N.; O'Rourke, S.

142,Preparing For the Next Pandemic: Learning Wild Mutational Patterns At Scale For For Analyzing Sequence Divergence In Novel Pathogens,"As we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question is if we can avert such disasters in future. Current surveillance protocols generally focus on qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity. These efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations that separate their genomic sequences, e.g. the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk, and gives us little indication of which strains are more risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance adapts to the specific organism, the background population, and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving inference of ancestral relationships and future trajectories. As important application, we show that the q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza, outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades. Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the SARS-CoV2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the likelihood of different animal species that hosted an immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV2 ancestor. Combining machine learning and large deviation theory, the analysis reported here may open the door to actionable predictions of future pandemics.","Li, J.; Li, T.; Chattopadhyay, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156364v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156364v1?rss=1,2020-07-19,2020-07-19,,True
143,Transmission Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the World: The Roles of Intervention and Seasonality,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly all over the world. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, but developing strategies for mitigating the severity of the pandemic is yet a top priority for global public health. In this study, we developed a novel compartmental model, SEIR-CV(susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed with control variables), which not only considers the key characteristics of asymptomatic infection and the effects of seasonal variations, but also incorporates different control measures for multiple transmission routes, so as to accurately predict and effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Based on SEIR-CV, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic situation in China out of Hubei province and proposed corresponding control strategies. The results showed that the prediction results are highly consistent with the outbreak surveillance data, which proved that the proposed control strategies have achieved sound consequent in the actual epidemic control. Subsequently, we have conducted a rolling prediction for the United States, Brazil, India, five European countries (the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France), southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere, and the world out of China. The results indicate that control measures and seasonal variations have a great impact on the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prediction results show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing more rapidly due to the impact of the cold season in the southern hemisphere countries such as Brazil. While the development of the pandemic should have gradually weakened in the northern hemisphere countries with the arrival of the warm season, instead of still developing rapidly due to the relative loose control measures such as the United States and India. Furthermore, the prediction results illustrate that if keeping the current control measures in the main COVID-19 epidemic countries, the pandemic will not be contained and the situation may eventually turn to group immunization, which would lead to the extremely severe disaster of about 5 billion infections and 300 million deaths globally. However, if China's super stringent control measures were implemented from 15 July, 15 August or 15 September 2020, the total infections would be contained about 15 million, 32 million or 370 million respectively, which indicates that the stringent and timely control measures is critical, and the best window period is before September for eventually overcoming COVID-19.","Huang, S.; Wu, L.; Xu, L.; Zhang, A.; Sheng, L.; Liu, F.; Zhou, L.; Li, J.; Hao, R.; Qian, H.; Fang, S.; Wang, Z.; Li, Y.; Li, Y.; Lu, C.; Deng, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156430v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156430v1?rss=1,2020-07-19,2020-07-19,,True

148,Genetic inhibition of interleukin-6 receptor signaling and Covid-19,"There are few effective therapeutic options for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Early evidence has suggested that IL-6R blockers may confer benefit, particularly in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We leveraged large-scale human genetic data to investigate whether IL6-R blockade may confer therapeutic benefit in Covid-19. A genetic instrument consisting of seven genetic variants in or close to IL6R was recently shown to be linked to altered levels of c-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6R, concordant to known effects of pharmacological IL-6R blockade. We investigated the effect of these IL6R variants on risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 and other SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes using data from The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The IL6R variants were strongly associated with serum CRP levels in UK Biobank. Meta-analysis of scaled estimates revealed a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.93 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.90-0.96, P = 9.5 x 10-7), recapitulating this established indication for IL-6R blockers (e.g. tocilizumab and sarilumab). The IL-6R instrument was associated with lower risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 (OR 0.88 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.78-0.99, P = 0.03). We found a consistent association when using a population-based control group (i.e. all non-cases; OR 0.91 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.87-0.96, P = 4.9 x 10-4). Evaluation of further SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes suggested association with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of association with Covid-19 complicated by death or requiring respiratory support. We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings. Our results serve as genetic evidence for the potential efficacy of IL-6R blockade in Covid-19.

149,A privacy-preserving Bayesian network model for personalised COVID19 risk assessment and contact tracing,"Concerns about the practicality and effectiveness of using Contact Tracing Apps (CTA) to reduce the spread of COVID19 have been well documented and, in the UK, led to the abandonment of the NHS CTA shortly after its release in May 2020. One of the key non-technical obstacles to widespread adoption of CTA has been concerns about privacy. We present a causal probabilistic model (a Bayesian network) that provides the basis for a practical CTA solution that does not compromise privacy. Users of the model can provide as much or little personal information as they wish about relevant risk factors, symptoms, and recent social interactions. The model then provides them feedback about the likelihood of the presence of asymptotic, mild or severe COVID19 (past, present and projected). When the model is embedded in a smartphone app, it can be used to detect new outbreaks in a monitored population and identify outbreak locations as early as possible. For this purpose, the only data needed to be centrally collected is the probability the user has COVID19 and the GPS location.","Fenton, N.; McLachlan, S.; Lucas, P.; Dube, K.; Hitman, G.; Osman, M.; Kyrimi, E.; Neil, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154286v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154286v1?rss=1,2020-07-19,2020-07-19,,True
150,Gender and trust in government modify the association between mental health and stringency of social distancing related public health measures to reduce COVID-19: a global online survey,"Objectives: To investigate the associations between stringency of COVID-19 social distancing policies and mental health outcomes, and the moderating effect of trust in government and gender. Design and setting: Cross sectional study involving secondary analysis of publicly available data from a global online COVID-19 survey and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices. Conclusion: As the stringency of public health measures increases, so too do depression and worries. The association is moderated by gender and trust in government. For safe and effective public health measures, governments should develop strategies to increase trust in their actions.","O'Hara, L.; Abdul Rahmin, H.

151,Modeling the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COVID-19 risk factors through predictive analysis,"With almost a third of adults being obese, another third hypertense and almost a tenth affected by diabetes, Latin American countries could see an elevated number of severe COVID-19 outcomes. We used the Open Dataset of Mexican patients with COVID-19 suspicion who had a definite RT-PCR result to develop a statistical model that evaluated the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. We included patients of all ages with every risk factor provided by the dataset: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and pregnancy. The dataset also included an unspecified category for other risk factors that were not specified as a single variable. To avoid excluding potential patients at risk, that category was included in our analysis. Due to the nature of the dataset, the calculation of a standardized comorbidity index was not possible. Therefore, we treated risk factors as a categorical variable with two categories: absence of risk factors and the presence of at least one risk factor in accordance with previous epidemiological reports. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to associate sex, risk factors, and age as a continuous variable (and the interaction that accounted for increasing diseases with older ages); and SARS-CoV-2 infection as the dependent zero-one binomial variable. Post estimation predictive marginal analysis was performed to generate probability trends along 95% confidence bands. This analysis was repeated several times through the course of the pandemic since the first record provided in their repository (April 12, 2020) to one month after the end of the state of sanitary emergency (the last date analyzed: June 27, 2020). After processing, the last measurement included 464,389 patients. The baseline analysis on April 12 revealed that people 35 years and older with at least one risk factor had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to patients without risk factors (Figure 1). One month before the end of the nationwide state of emergency this age threshold was found at 50 years (May 2, 2020) and it shifted to 65 years on May 30. Two weeks after the end of the public emergency (June 13, 2020) the trends converged at 80 years and one week later (June 27, 2020) every male and female patient with at least one risk factor had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without risk factors. Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all four probability curves shifted upwards as a result of progressive disease spread. In conclusion, we found our model could monitor accurately the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age, sex, and the presence of at least one risk factor. Also, because the model can be applied to any particular political region within Mexico, it could help evaluate the contagion spread in specific vulnerable populations. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying nature of the mechanisms behind such observations.","Leon-Abarca, J.

152,Regional COVID-19 spread despite expected declines: how mitigation is hindered by spatio-temporal variation in local control measures.,"Successful public health regimes for COVID-19 push below unity long-term global Rt -- the average number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual. Most assessments use local information. Populations differ in Rt, amongst themselves and over time. We use a SIR model for two populations to make the conceptual point that even if each locality averages Rt < 1, the overall epidemic can still grow, provided these populations have asynchronous variation in transmission, and are coupled by movement of infectious individuals. This emergent effect in pandemic dynamics instantiates ""Parrondo's Paradox,"" -- an entity comprised of distinct but interacting units can behave qualitatively differently than each part on its own. For effective COVID-19 disease mitigation strategies, it is critical that infectious individuals moving among locations be identified and quarantined. This does not warrant indiscriminate prevention of movement, but rather rational, targeted testing and national coordination.","Kortessis, N.; Simon, M. W.; Barfield, M.; Glass, G.; Singer, B.

153,Characterizing the Qatar advanced-phase SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"ABSTRACT Background: Qatar has a population of 2.8 million, over half of whom are expatriate craft and manual workers (CMW). We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the CMW and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 31,040 and 8.0%, respectively, on May 20 and May 21. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 61.3% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles. The epidemic demonstrated a classic susceptible-infected-recovered SIR dynamics with a rather stable R0 of about 1.6. The young demographic structure of the population, in addition to a resourced public health response, yielded a milder disease burden and lower mortality than elsewhere.","Abu-Raddad, L.

154,Geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare in Brazil using a balanced float catchment area approach,"The rapid spread of the new coronavirus across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to the response capacity of hospitals at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","Pereira, R. H.

155,Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk within the Apple/Google exposure notification framework to inform quarantine recommendations,"Background: Bluetooth-based exposure notification apps can supplement manual contact tracing to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Their speed, scalability, and privacy preservation are generally acknowledged, but less exploited are smartphones' accurate measurement of duration, and ability to automatically calculate risk from multiple inputs. Methods: We model uncertainty in the shape of an exhaled virus-containing plume, inhalation parameters, and distance as a function of Bluetooth attenuation. We assume relative rates of viral shedding depend on the timing of exposure relative to symptom onset. We calibrate an exponential dose-response curve on the basis of the infection probabilities of household contacts. The conditional probability of current or future infectiousness, conditioned on how long post-exposure an exposed individual has been free of symptoms, decreases during quarantine, with shape determined by the distribution of incubation periods, proportion of asymptomatic cases, and distribution of asymptomatic shedding durations. It can be adjusted for negative test results using Bayes Theorem. Findings: As an example of our calculations, fifteen minutes of close contact with a high-shedding individual, given a 15% asymptomatic infection rate and no testing, would require 5- and 14-day quarantine for their risk of current or future infectiousness to fall below 0.84% and 0.14% risk, respectively. Interpretation: The Covid-Watch app is currently programmed either to use a threshold on initial infection risk to determine 14-day quarantine onset, or on the conditional probability of current and future infectiousness conditions to determine both quarantine and duration. Either threshold can be set by public health authorities.","Wilson, A. M.; Aviles, N.; Beamer, P. I.; Szabo, Z.; Ernst, K.

156,"Emerging Mental Health Challenges, Strategies and Opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from South American Decision-makers.","Background Mental health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although international guidelines address the mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) response to emergencies, regional recommendations on COVID-19 are still insufficient. We identified emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of Ministries of Health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into 3 main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and, key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Findings An increasing mental health burden and emerging needs are arising as direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic among health care providers and the general population. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet these health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources and collaboration with local and international partners. Interpretation Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions including: implementing virtual based interventions, orienting capacity building towards protection of users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision making and integrating MHPSS in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.

157,The landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications,"In 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.","Miladi, M.; Fuchs, J.; Maier, W.; Weigang, S.; Diaz i Pedrosa, N.; Weiss, L.; Lother, A.; Nekrutenko, A.; Ruzsics, Z.; Panning, M.; Kochs, G.; Gilsbach, R.; Gruening, B.

158,Association between consumption of vegetables and COVID-19 mortality at a country level in Europe,"Background Many foods have an antioxidant activity, and nutrition may mitigate COVID-19. To test the potential role of vegetables in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of Brassica vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, head cabbage (white, red and savoy cabbage), leafy brassica) and to compare them with spinach, cucumber, courgette, lettuce and tomato. The COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people over 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage of obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only head cabbage and cucumber reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g/day increase in the average national consumption of some of the vegetables (head cabbage and cucumber), the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by a factor of 11, down to 13.6 %. Lettuce consumption increased COVID-19 mortality. The adjustment did not change the point estimate and the results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and the consumption of cabbage and cucumber supports the a priori hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of vegetables is common.","Fonseca, S.

159,Development and Validation of a Web-Based Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Model,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) carries high morbidity and mortality globally. Identification of patients at risk for clinical deterioration upon presentation would aid in triaging, prognostication, and allocation of resources and experimental treatments. Research Question: Can we develop and validate a web-based risk prediction model for identification of patients who may develop severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or death? Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed 415 patients admitted to a large urban academic medical center and community hospitals. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. The independent association of predictors with severe COVID-19 was determined using multivariable logistic regression. A derivation cohort (n=311, 75%) was used to develop the prediction models. The models were tested by a validation cohort (n=104, 25%). Results: The median age was 66 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 54-77) and the majority were male (55%) and non-White (65.8%). The 14-day severe COVID-19 rate was 39.3%; 31.7% required ICU, 24.6% mechanical ventilation, and 21.2% died. Machine learning algorithms and clinical judgment were used to improve model performance and clinical utility, resulting in the selection of eight predictors: age, sex, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, troponin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase. The discriminative ability was excellent for both the severe COVID-19 (training area under the curve [AUC]=0.82, validation AUC=0.82) and mortality (training AUC= 0.85, validation AUC=0.81) models. These models were incorporated into a mobile-friendly website.

160,Identifying organ dysfunction trajectory-based subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19,"Rationale. COVID-19-associated respiratory failure offers the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the differential host response to a uniform pathogenic insult. Prior studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have identified subphenotypes with differential outcomes. Understanding whether there are distinct subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology. Objectives. To identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Methods. Intubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild, intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time Warping. Statistical tests defined trajectory subphenotype predictive markers. Measurements and Main Results. Distinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%, p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs. 22.2%, p<0.001). Worsening and recovering subphenotypes were replicated in the validation cohort. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables rather than demographics and comorbidities were predictive of the worsening and recovering subphenotypes. Conclusions. There are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19 respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline severity of illness. Organ dysfunction trajectory may be well suited as a surrogate for research in COVID-19 respiratory failure.","Su, C.; Xu, Z.; Hoffman, K.; Goyal, P.; Safford, M.

161,SARS-Cov-2 cysteine-like protease (Mpro) is immunogenic and can be detected in serum and saliva of COVID-19-seropositive individuals,"Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no cross-reactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","Martinez-Fleta, P.; Alfranca, A.; Gonzalez-Alvaro, I.; Casasnovas, J.

We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this measurement system is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","Yokoyama, R.; Kurano, M.; Morita, Y.; Shimura, T.; Nakano, Y.; Qian, C.; Xia, F.; He, F.; Kishi, Y.; Okada, J.; Yoshikawa, N.; Nagura, Y.; Okazaki, H.; Moriya, K.; Seto, Y.; Kodama, T.; Yatomi, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155796v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155796v1?rss=1,2020-07-18,2020-07-18,,True

164,Interplay of Monocytes and T Lymphocytes in COVID-19 Severity,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents an ongoing global crisis that has already impacted over 13 million people. The responses of specific immune cell populations to the disease remain poorly defined, which hinders improvements in treatment and care management. Here, we utilized mass cytometry (CyTOF) to thoroughly phenotype peripheral myeloid cells and T lymphocytes from 30 convalescent patients with mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. We identified 10 clusters of monocytes and dendritic cells and 17 clusters of T cells. Examination of these clusters revealed that both CD14+CD16+ intermediate and CD14dimCD16+ nonclassical monocytes, as well as CD4+ stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, correlated with COVID-19 severity, coagulation factor levels, and/or inflammatory indicators. We also identified two nonclassical monocyte subsets distinguished by expression of the sugar residue 6-Sulfo LacNac (Slan). One of these subsets (Slanlo, nMo1) was depleted in moderately and severely ill patients, while the other (Slanhi, nMo2) increased with disease severity and was linked to CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell frequencies, coagulation factors, and inflammatory indicators. Intermediate monocytes tightly correlated with loss of naive T cells as well as an increased abundance of effector memory T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our data suggest that both intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets shape the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides both broad and in-depth characterization of immune cell phenotypes in response to COVID-19 and suggests functional interactions between distinct cell types during the disease.

165,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein hijacks VEGF-A/Neuropilin-1 receptor signaling to induce analgesia,"Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - a pronociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A  silencing of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.

166,Structural basis for the inhibition of the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 by small molecules,"SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease has been implicated in virus maturation, dysregulation of host inflammation and antiviral immune responses. We showed that PLpro preferably cleaves the K48-ubiquitin linkage while also being capable of cleaving ISG15 modification. The multiple functions of PLpro render it a promising drug target. Therefore, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and also examined available inhibitors against PLpro. Inhibitor GRL0617 showed a promising IC50 of 2.1 M. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-C111S in complex with GRL0617 suggests that GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor. NMR data indicate that GRL0617 blocks the binding of ISG15 to PLpro. The antiviral activity of GRL0617 reveal that PLpro is a promising drug target for therapeutically treating COVID-19.

167,Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A cohort study.,"Background: Since the start of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, corticosteroid use has been the subject of debate. The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. Results: One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Albani, F.; Fusina, F.; Granato, E.; Capotosto, C.; Ceracchi, C.; Gargaruti, R.; Santangelo, G.; Schiavone, L.; Taranto, M.

168,Is it safe to lift COVID-19 travel bans? The Newfoundland story.,"A key strategy to prevent a local outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic is to restrict incoming travel. Once a region has successfully contained the disease, it becomes critical to decide when and how to reopen the borders. Here we explore the impact of border reopening for the example of Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province that has enjoyed no new cases since late April, 2020. We combine a network epidemiology model with machine learning to infer parameters and predict the COVID-19 dynamics upon partial and total airport reopening, with perfect and imperfect quarantine conditions. Our study suggests that upon full reopening, every other day, a new COVID-19 case would enter the province. Under the current conditions, banning air travel from outside Canada is more efficient in managing the pandemic than fully reopening and quarantining 95% of the incoming population. Our study provides quantitative insights of the efficacy of travel restrictions and can inform political decision making in the controversy of reopening.","Linka, K.; Rahman, P.; Goriely, A.; Kuhl, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155614v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155614v1?rss=1,2020-07-18,2020-07-18,,True
169,Outcomes of Mechanically Ventilated Patients with COVID-19 Associated Respiratory Failure,"Purpose: The outcomes of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 remain poorly defined. We sought to determine clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 managed with invasive mechanical ventilation in an appropriately resourced US health care system. Methods: Outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation treated within the Inova Health System between March 5, 2020 and April 26, 2020 were evaluated through an electronic medical record review. Results: 1023 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to the Inova Health System during the study period. Of these, 165 (16.1%) were managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of data censoring, 63/165 patients (38.1%) had died and 102/165 (61.8%) were still alive. Of the surviving 102 patients, 17 (10.3%) remained on mechanical ventilation, 51 (30.9%) were extubated but remained hospitalized, and 34 (20.6%) had been discharged. Deceased patients were older (median age of 66 vs. 55, p <0.0001). 75.7% of patients over 70 years old had died at the time of data analysis. Conversely, 71.2% of patients age 70 or younger were still alive at the time of data analysis. Younger age, non-Caucasian race and treatment at a tertiary care center were all associated with survivor status. Conclusion: Mortality of patients with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with particularly daunting mortality seen in patients of advanced age, even in a well-resourced health care system. A substantial proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were not of advanced age, and this group had a reasonable chance for recovery.","King, C.; Sahjwani, D.; Brown, A.

170,Is population anxiety associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths? A study protocol.,"BACKGROUND The nocebo effect is any harmful reaction following a negative suggestion. Anxiety can be seen as a manifestation of a nocebo context. The psychological stress of the COVID-19 pandemic led some people to experience COVID-19 symptoms, which were not actually related to a COVID-19 infection. A fundamental goal during the COVID-19 pandemic is to limit the COVID-19 related demand on healthcare systems and to minimize COVID-19 related deaths. This exploratory study aims to determine to what extent the anxiety in the population is related to the number of covid-19 related hospitalizations and deaths. METHODS We will quantify the magnitude of the relationship between population anxiety and hospitalizations / deaths. Anxiety will be assessed using the results of the most frequently used anxiety measuring scale. Official websites of governments will be screened to determine hospitalizations and deaths. Studies will be included if they had at least 100 respondents, used a validated anxiety scale, reported on the general population of a country, and were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic. A search strategy will take into account the limited resources for this study and will be used to search Pubmed, MedRXiv and PsychRXiv. Screening will take place at two levels: abstracts and titles, followed by full text reports. One researcher will extract data which will be double checked by a second researcher. We will perform weighted OLS regression to quantify the relationship of anxiety and covid-19 related hospitalizations / deaths. DISCUSSION Covid-19 related measures can carry a significant social cost and risk of unwanted effects; it is therefore important to assess the extent to which anxiety in the population is related to covid-19 related hospitalizations or deaths. If anxiety can be properly reduced in the population, health care will be safeguarded. Thus, any strategy that reduces anxiety can then be included in evidence-based decision making.","Feys, F.; Naser, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155457v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155457v1?rss=1,2020-07-18,2020-07-18,,True
171,An overview of current mental health in the general population of Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the COLLATE project,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses significant mental health challenges globally; however, to date, there is limited community level data. This study reports on the first wave of data from the COLLATE project (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy), an ongoing study aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Australians. This paper addresses prevailing primary concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, current levels of negative emotions and risk factors predicting these negative emotions. On April 1st to 4th 2020, 5158 adult members of the Australian general public completed an online survey. Participants ranked their top ten current primary concerns about COVID-19, and completed standardized measures to ascertain levels of negative emotions (specifically, depression, anxiety and stress). Socio-demographic information was also collected and used in the assessment of risk factors. The top three primary concerns were all related to the health and well-being of family and loved ones. As expected, levels of negative emotion were exceptionally high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing experiences; particularly being young, being female, or having a mental illness diagnosis. The data provides important characterization of the current mental health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Critically, it appears that specific groups in the Australian community may need special attention to ensure their mental health is protected during these difficult times. The data further suggests the need for immediate action to combat high levels of psychological distress, along with the exacerbation of mental health conditions, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. These results may provide some direction for international researchers hoping to characterize similar issues in other countries.","Rossell, S.; Neill, E.; Phillipou, A.; Tan, E.; Toh, W.

172,Are countries precautionary actions against COVID-19 effective? An assessment study of 175 countries worldwide,"Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many countries negatively, particularly in terms of their health care and financial systems. Numerous countries have attempted to employ precautions to address this pandemic. Objective This study was aimed at exploring and assessing the precautionary actions taken by 175 countries on six continents to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods An observational study was conducted based on data collected during the period from December 31, 2020, until the end of April 2020. Several data were extracted, including information related to the date of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2, total confirmed cases, total active cases, and more. In addition, seven validated indicators were used to assess the countries preparedness and precautionary actions. Results A total of 175 countries were included in the study. The total COVID-19 infection rate increased exponentially and rapidly in North America and Europe from March to April. The application of the precautions (indicators) varied between countries. School closures, quarantines and curfews were the most applied indicators among all countries. As for the relationship between the indicators and their effects on the infection rate, Italy and Spain were the top countries in Europe and adopted all indicators. Nevertheless, they faced high infection rates: 239,639 and 205,463 COVID-19 cases in Spain, and Italy, respectively. Conclusion The precautionary actions might have played a role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in several countries. However, many countries did not benefit from applying these indicators.","Alshammari, T.

173,"The impact of climate temperature on counts, recovery, and death rates due to SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa.","The impact of climate temperature on the counts (number of positive COVID-19 cases reported), recovery, and death rates of COVID-19 cases in all of South Africa's 9 provinces was investigated. The data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were collected for March 25 and June 30, 2020 (14 weeks) from South Africa's Government COVID-19 online resource, while the daily provincial climate temperatures were collected from the website of the South African Weather Service. Our result indicates that a higher or lower climate temperature does not prevent or delay the spread and death rates but shows significant positive impacts on the recovery rates of COVID-19 patients. Thus, it indicates that the climate temperature is unlikely to impose a strict limit on the spread of COVID-19. There is no correlation between the cases and death rates, an indicator that no particular temperature range is closely associated with a faster or slower death rate of COVID-19 patients. As evidence from our study, a warm climate temperature can only increase the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients, ultimately impacting the death and active case rates and freeing up resources quicker to enable health facilities to deal with the climbing rates of those patients who need treatment.","Ilori, A.

174,Probability of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory droplets from infected humans. Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modelling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In line with the current known reproduction numbers, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is an inefficient route, in particular from non or mildly symptomatic individuals.","Bonn, D.; Smith, S.

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. Methods From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Results Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and other clinical staff (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42). Factors significantly protective for burnout included being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.82) and top quartile SAQ score (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.40). Significant factors associated with anxiety and depression, included burnout, gender, safety attitudes and job role. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of burnout, anxiety, and depression amongst healthcare workers. A strong association was seen between SARS-CoV-2 testing, safety attitudes, gender, job role, redeployment and psychological state. These findings highlight the importance of targeted support services for at risk groups and proactive SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers.","Denning, M.; Goh, E.

178,A Contact-Explicit Covid-19 Epidemic and Response Assessment Model,"We formulate a refined SEIR epidemic model that explicitly includes a contact class C that either thwarts pathogen invasion and returns to the susceptible class S or progresses successively through a latent class L, a presymptomatic/asymptomatic class A, and a symptomatic class I. Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. Upon this SCLAIV formulation we impose a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment/isolation and vaccination processes that can either be a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching curve. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19 NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood frequentist and Bayesian fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the case are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (again, actual number considerably higher) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local optimal fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks---one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population. Our presentation illustrates how our Covid-19 web app can be used by individuals without any programming skills to carry out forensic and scenario analyses in spatially contained populations such as small countries or metropolitan areas.","Getz, W.

179,Barriers to online learning in the time of COVID-19: A national survey of medical students in the Philippines,"INTRODUCTION In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced medical schools in the Philippines to stop face-to-face learning activities and abruptly shift to an online curriculum. This study aimed to identify barriers to online learning from the perspective of medical students in a developing country. METHODS The authors sent out an electronic survey to medical students in the Philippines from 11 to 24 May 2020. Using a combination of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, the following data were obtained: demographics, medical school information, access to technological resources, study habits, living conditions, self-assessment of capacity for and perceived barriers to online learning, and proposed interventions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Responses were compared between student subgroups using nonparametric tests. RESULTS Among 3,670 medical students, 3,421 (93%) owned a smartphone and 3,043 (83%) had a laptop or desktop computer. To access online resources, 2,916 (79%) had a postpaid internet subscription while 696 (19%) used prepaid mobile data. Under prevailing conditions, only 1,505 students (41%) considered themselves physically and mentally capable of engaging in online learning. Barriers were classified under five categories: technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community barriers. Most frequently encountered were difficulty adjusting learning styles, having to perform responsibilities at home, and poor communication between educators and learners. DISCUSSION Medical students in the Philippines confronted several interrelated barriers as they tried to adapt to online learning. By implementing student-centered interventions, medical schools and educators play a significant role in addressing these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Baticulon, R.

180,The risk of severe COVID-19: hospital and ICU admission rates in Norway,"Background: Epidemiological studies of COVID-19 with population based information may add to the knowledge needed to prioritise resources and advice on how restrictive measures should be targeted. This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: Data from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to ICU stratified by age. Results: The admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times (confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5, respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared to people younger than 50 years. Conclusion: Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79 years of age. These results and more detailed data could provide better advice on how restrictions can be safely lessened.","Munkvik, M.; Vatten Alsnes, I.; Vatten, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155358v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155358v1?rss=1,2020-07-18,2020-07-18,,True
181,COVID-19 patients upregulate toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory signaling that mimics bacterial sepsis,"Observational studies of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak suggest that a cytokine storm is involved in the pathogenesis of severe illness. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered pathological inflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We report here that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules are upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients, compared with healthy controls. Among the most highly increased inflammatory mediators in severe/critically ill patients, S100A9, an alarmin and TLR4 ligand, was found as a noteworthy biomarker, because it inversely correlated with the serum albumin levels. These data support a link between TLR4 signaling and pathological inflammation during COVID-19 and contribute to develop therapeutic approaches through targeting TLR4-mediated inflammation.","Sohn, K.

182,Systematic modeling of SARS-CoV-2 protein structures,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, structural biologists are using experimental structural determination methods to better understand the viral proteome. Our goal in this work was to help researchers use these rapidly emerging structural data to gain detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying COVID-19 infection. Our analysis was based on the protein sequences defined by UniProt as comprising the viral proteome. We systematically compared each SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence against all available protein 3D structures derived from any organism (164,250 PDB entries), using pairs of hidden Markov models built with the HHblits tool. We found 872 sequence-to-structure alignments assessed to have significant similarity (E < 10e-10) to infer structural similarity. The resulting 872 3D template models now provide a wealth of new detail, currently not available from related resources. To help make this large, complex dataset accessible and usable for other researchers, we also developed a tailored layout strategy to visually organise the 3D models by mapping them to the viral genome. The resulting graph provides an immediate and comprehensive visual overview of what is known - and not known - about the 3D structure of the viral proteome, thereby helping direct future research. The graph also clearly reveals all available structural evidence of viral mimicry or hijacking of human proteins, as well as all evidence of interactions between viral proteins. We have created PDF and online versions of the graph, in which users can click on any node in the graph to open the corresponding 3D model in the Aquaria molecular graphics system. In Aquaria, these models can then be colored to show sequence features, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications. Previous versions of Aquaria showed only features from UniProt; however, as part of this study, we have now added features from PredictProtein and CATH, thus providing a total of 32,717 features for SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. In this work, we present novel insights found, using the above approach, into how SARS-CoV-2 mimics and hijacks host proteins, and how viral proteins self-assemble during infection. The resulting Aquaria-COVID resource is freely available online at https://aquaria.ws/covid19, and an accompanying video (https://youtu.be/J2nWQTlJNaY) explains how researchers can use the resource.","O'Donoghue, S.

183,Development of a simple in vitro assay to identify and evaluate nucleotide analogs against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Nucleotide analogs targeting viral RNA polymerase have been approved to be an effective strategy for antiviral treatment and are attracting antiviral drugs to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by RdRp. We found that the incorporation efficiency of Remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and we did not observe chain termination or delayed chain termination caused by single Remdesivir-TP incorporation, while multiple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low either as ATP or GTP analogs, which suggested that mutagenesis may not be the mechanism of action of those two drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Incorporation of Sofosbuvir-TP is also very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2-C-Methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful in evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analog.","Lu, G.; Zhang, X.; Zheng, W.; Sun, J.; Hua, L.; Xu, L.; Chu, X.-j.; Ding, S.; Xiong, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205799v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.205799v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
184,COVID-19 Detection on Chest X-Ray and CT Scan Images Using Multi-image Augmented Deep Learning Model,"COVID-19 is posed as very infectious and deadly pneumonia type disease until recent time. Novel coronavirus or SARS-COV-2 strain is responsible for COVID-19 and it has already shown the deadly nature of respiratory disease by threatening the health of millions of lives across the globe. Clinical study reveals that a COVID-19 infected person may experience dry cough, muscle pain, headache, fever, sore throat and mild to moderate respiratory illness. At the same time, it affects the lungs badly with virus infection. So, the lung can be a prominent internal organ to diagnose the gravity of COVID-19 infection using X-Ray and CT scan images of chest. Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. This paper reports a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-image augmentation technique for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-Ray and chest CT scan images of coronavirus suspected individuals. Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%. Evaluation has been done on publicly available databases containing both chest X-Ray and CT scan images and the experimental results are also compared with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models.","Purohit, K.; Kesarwani, A.; Kisku, D.

185,Longitudinal analysis of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in convalescent plasma donors,"Hema-Quebec, the blood supplier in the Province of Quebec, Canada, collects and tests convalescent plasma used in a clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of this product for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.","Perreault, J.; Tremblay, T.; Fournier, M.-J.; Drouin, M.; Beaudoin-Bussieres, G.; Prevost, J.; Lewin, A.; Begin, P.; Finzi, A.; Bazin, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
186,Mutational dynamics and transmission properties of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in Austria,"Superspreading events shape the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we provide a national-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Austria, a country that played a major role for virus transmission across Europe and beyond. Capitalizing on a national epidemiological surveillance system, we performed deep whole-genome sequencing of virus isolates from 576 samples to cover major Austrian SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Our data chart a map of early viral spreading in Europe, including the path from low-frequency mutations to fixation. Detailed epidemiological surveys enabled us to calculate the effective SARS-CoV-2 population bottlenecks during transmission and unveil time-resolved intra-patient viral quasispecies dynamics. This study demonstrates the power of integrating deep viral genome sequencing and epidemiological data to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads through populations.

As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 {degrees}C vs. 37 {degrees}C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.","Pagani, I.; Ghezzi, S.; Clementi, M.; Poli, G.; Bussi, M.; Pianta, L.; Trimarchi, M.; Vicenzi, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193193v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193193v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
188,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Protease Inhibitors by a Quantitative High-throughput Screening,"Background and PurposeThe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emphasized the urgent need for therapeutic development. Drug repurposing screening is the most practical and rapid approach for discovery of such therapeutics. The 3CLpro, or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a viral enzyme with an essential role in viral replication, and cleavage specificity that is distinct from host proteases.

Experimental ApproachWe employed and miniaturized a fluorogenic 3CLpro enzyme assay in which 3CLpro cleaves a quenched peptide substrate and releases a fluorescent fragment, resulting an increase in fluorescence signal. By using this SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay, we conducted a qHTS of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds, at 4 compound concentrations. The confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors were also tested in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay to determine their effects on rescuing of cell death caused by the virus infection.

Key ResultsTwenty-seven small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 27.1 M with a greater than 80% maximal inhibition. Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 M), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 M), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.50 M), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 M), and LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 M) are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors with IC50s under 10 M. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were confirmed in 11 of 27 compounds.

Conclusion and ImplicationsSome of the newly identified inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro may be used in combination therapy with other drugs for synergistic effect to treat COVID-19 patients. The other inhibitors found in this study can provide starting points for medicinal chemistry optimizations.

189,A single intranasal dose of chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine confers sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and likely confers sterilizing immunity in most animals. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.","Hassan, A. O.; Kafai, N. M.; Dmitriev, I.

190,Modeling the Impact of Lock-down on COVID-19 Spread in Malaysia,"After a breakdown notified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 is declared as pandemic diseases. To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases. The implemented SEIR model shows a close resemblance with the actual data recorded from 10, March till 7, July 2020.

Although Thailand has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, disease surveillance and information on antibody responses in infected cases and close contacts are needed because there is still no specific treatment or vaccine available. We investigated 217 recovered COVID-19 cases to monitor their viral RNA shedding and production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of COVID-19 cases was also determined. Viral RNA was still detectable in 6.6 % of recovered COVID-19 cases. The most prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding detected in this study was 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.82, 88.48, and 83.41 % of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Although the patients had recovered from their illness, the levels of antibodies detected showed association with their symptoms during their stay in hospital. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.87 %) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that there was viral exposure among close contacts. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combatting SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and a strategy for vaccine development.","Chirathaworn, C.; Sripramote, M.; Chalongviriyalert, P.; Jirajariyavej, S.; Kiatpanabhikul, P.; Saiyarin, J.; Soudon, C.; Thienfaidee, O.; Palakawong Na Ayuthaya, T.; Brukesawan, C.; Chaiwanichsiri, D.; Intharasongkroh, D.; Wanlapakorn, N.; Chansaenroj, J.; Puenpa, J.; Yorsaeng, R.; Thitithanyanont, A.; Kitphati, R.; Mungaomklang, A.; Nagavajara, P.; Poovorawan, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.208439v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.208439v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
192,Simulations support the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and suggest subtype specificity,"Changeux et al. recently suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity. Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs, and of the S protein, to investigate this  nicotinic hypothesis. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop of the S protein to three nAChRs, namely the human 4{beta}2 and 7 subtypes and the muscle-like {beta}{gamma}{delta} receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results indicate that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs and the region responsible for binding contains the PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. In particular, R682 has a key role in the stabilisation of the complexes as it forms interactions with loops A, B and C in the receptors binding pocket. The conformational behaviour of the bound Y674-R685 region is highly dependent on the receptor subtype, adopting extended conformations in the 4{beta}2 and 7 complexes and more compact ones when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the 4{beta}2 and {beta}{gamma}{delta} complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the 7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket where it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1 and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685, forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes, but has highest affinity for the muscle-type receptor. Analyses of the simulations of the full-length S protein show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding, and suggest a potential binding orientation of the S protein with nAChRs.","Oliveira, A.

193,Identification of SARS-CoV2-mediated suppression of NRF2 signaling reveals a potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of 4-octyl-itaconate and dimethyl fumarate,"Antiviral strategies to inhibit Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and the pathogenic consequences of COVID-19 are urgently required. Here we demonstrate that the NRF2 anti-oxidant gene expression pathway is suppressed in biopsies obtained from COVID-19 patients. Further, we uncover that NRF2 agonists 4-octyl-itaconate (4-OI) and the clinically approved dimethyl fumarate (DMF) induce a cellular anti-viral program, which potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV2 across cell lines. The anti-viral program extended to inhibit the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism. In addition, induction of NRF2 by 4-OI and DMF limited host inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV2 infection associated with airway COVID-19 pathology. In conclusion, NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF induce a distinct IFN-independent antiviral program that is broadly effective in limiting virus replication and suppressing the pro-inflammatory responses of human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV2.

194,Outcome of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in patients with Interstitial Lung Disease: An international multicentre study.,"Rationale: The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has not been established. Objectives: To assess outcomes following COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without in a contemporaneous age, sex and comorbidity matched population. Methods: An international multicentre audit of patients with a prior diagnosis of ILD admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 1 May 2020 was undertaken and compared with patients, without ILD obtained from the ISARIC 4C cohort, admitted with COVID-19 over the same period. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary analysis distinguished IPF from non-IPF ILD and used lung function to determine the greatest risks of death. Measurements and Main Results: Data from 349 patients with ILD across Europe were included, of whom 161 were admitted to hospital with laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19 and eligible for propensity-score matching. Overall mortality was 49% (79/161) in patients with ILD with COVID-19. After matching ILD patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality (HR 1.60, Confidence Intervals 1.17-2.18 p=0.003) compared with age, sex and co-morbidity matched controls without ILD. Patients with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of <80% had an increased risk of death versus patients with FVC [&ge;]80% (HR 1.72, 1.05-2.83). Furthermore, obese patients with ILD had an elevated risk of death (HR 1.98, 1.13-3.46). Conclusions: Patients with ILD are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, particularly those with poor lung function and obesity. Stringent precautions should be taken to avoid COVID-19 in patients with ILD.","Jenkins, G.; Drake, T.; Docherty, A.

195,"Preparedness, Perceived Impact and Concerns of health Care Workers in a Teaching Hospital during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Objective: Coronavirus Disease 2019 is a new threat to human lives worldwide. Preparedness of institutions during epidemic outbreak has a pivotal role in saving lives and preventing further spread. At the same time, these pandemics impact badly on professional and personal life of Health care workers. The objective of this study is to find the opinion of Health care workers regarding their level of preparedness, concerns and perceived impact related to this pandemic outbreak. Materials and Methods: in this study, random samples of doctors and nurses was provided with a self-administered questionnaire regarding their preparedness, work and non-work related concerns and impact on their lives during Covid-19 outbreak. Results: Most of the Health Care Workers believed that their institute preparation to fight Covid-19 pandemic is better than prior to onset of this crisis (p<0.001). Work related stress was seen more commonly in nurses whereas higher frequency of non-work related stress was observed among doctors. Nurses (75.55%) faith in their employer was more than doctors faith (46.66%) regarding their medical needs. There was more acceptance of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19 in doctors compared to nurses (p <0.01). Conclusions: Though this institute was more prepared at the time of pandemic spread, substantial opportunity of improvement remains. The consistency of work and non work related anxiety and stress in health care workers is very high in present study group.

196,Mapping physical access to healthcare for older adults in sub-Saharan Africa: A cross-sectional analysis with implications for the COVID-19 response,"Background: SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is rapidly spreading across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is particularly often needed among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in SSA is travel time. To inform the geographic targeting of additional healthcare resources, this study aimed to determine the estimated travel time at a 1km x 1km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in SSA. Methods: We assembled a unique dataset on healthcare facilities' geolocation, separately for hospitals and any type of healthcare facility (including primary care facilities) and including both private- and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the KEMRI Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1km x 1km resolution was obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility for each 1km x 1km raster using a cost-distance algorithm. Findings: 9.6% (95% CI: 5.2% - 16.9%) of adults aged 60 and older years had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of longer than six hours, varying from 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.7%) in Burundi and The Gambia, to 40.9% (95% CI: 31.8% - 50.7%) in Sudan. 11.2% (95% CI: 6.4% - 18.9%) of adults aged 60 years and older had an estimated travel time to the nearest healthcare facility of any type (whether primary or secondary/tertiary care) of longer than three hours, with a range of 0.1% (95% CI: 0.0% - 3.8%) in Burundi to 55.5% (95% CI: 52.8% - 64.9%) in Sudan. Most countries in SSA contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of more than 12 hours and to the nearest healthcare facility of any type of more than six hours. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 and older years with the longest travel times was 348 minutes (IQR: 240 - 576 minutes) for the entire SSA population, ranging from 41 minutes (IQR: 34 - 54 minutes) in Burundi to 1,655 minutes (IQR: 1065 - 2440 minutes) in Gabon. Interpretation: Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and healthcare facilities of any type can be used by policymakers and non-governmental organizations to help target additional healthcare resources, such as new make-shift hospitals or transport programs to existing healthcare facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows precisely where population groups are located that are particularly likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to healthcare facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform countries' efforts to improve care for conditions that are common among older adults, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.","Reinmuth, M.; Geldsetzer, P.; Ouma, P.

Methods: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

200,Reconciling model predictions with low reported cases of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights from Madagascar,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally, and there has been a particular concern for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where models suggest that the majority of the population will become infected. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology, socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems. However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions. The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to 50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.","Evans, M.

Both cough and sneeze based droplets or aerosols encapsulated COVID-19 particles are responsible for air borne transmission of this virus and caused unexpected escalation and high mortality worldwide. Current study intends to investigate correlation of COVID-19 epidemic with meteorological parameters particularly, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed along with population size. Data set of COVID-19 for highly infected cities of Pakistan was collected from the official website of National Institute of health (NIH). Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficient test employed for data analysis revealed significant correlation between temperature minimum (TM), temperature average (TA), wind speed (WS) and population size (PS) with COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to analyze the sensitivity of TA, WS, and PS on transmission rate of COVID-19 in selected cities of Pakistan. The results obtained for sensitivity and specificity analysis for all selected parameters signifies sensitivity and direct correlation of COVID-19 transmission with temperature variation, WS and PS. Positive correlation and strong association of PS parameter with COVID-19 pandemic suggested need of more strict actions and control measures for highly populated cities. These findings will be helpful for health regulatory authorities and policymakers to take specific measures to combat COVID-19 epidemic in Pakistan.","Shahzadi, I.; Shahzadi, A.; Haider, J.; Naz, S.; Aamir, R.

202,Computer-aided covid-19 patient screening using chest images (X-Ray and CT scans),"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to detect covid -19 from chest images (X-Ray and CT scans). METHODS Chest CT scans and X-Ray images collected from different centers and institutions were downloaded and combined together. Images were separated by patient and 66% of the patients were used to develop and train AI image-based classifiers. Then, the AI automated classifiers were evaluated on a separate set of patients (the remaining 33% patients). RESULTS (Chest X-Ray) Five different data sources were combined for a total of N=9,841 patients (1,733 with covid-19, 810 with bacterial tuberculosis and 7,298 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=3,528 patients. The best AI method reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for covid-19 detection of 99%, with a detection rate of 96.4% at 1.0% false positive rate. RESULTS (Chest CT scans) Two different data sources were combined for a total of N=363 patients (191 having covid-19 and 172 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=121 patients. The best AI method reached an AUC for covid-19 detection of 90.9%, with a detection rate of 90.6% at 24.6% false positive rate. CONCLUSIONS Computer aided automatic covid-19 detection from chest X-ray images showed promising results to be used as screening tool during the covid-19 outbreak. The developed method may help to manage patients better in case access to PCR testing is not possible or to detect patients with symptoms missed in a first round of PCR testing.

203,Qualitative Changes in the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response in the Post-Infection Phase Impact the estimates of infections in Population-Based Seroprevalence Studies,"We have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in a cohort of 96 individuals with acute infection and in 578 individuals enrolled in a seroprevalence population study in Switzerland including three groups, i.e. subjects with previous RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=90), positive patient contacts (n=177) and random selected subjects (n=311). SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric forms, and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of patient positive contacts, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction and in the random selected general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.","Fenwick, C.; Croxatto, A.; Coste, A.

China has a dual burden of TB and COVID-19. We conducted a survey and collected data from 13 provinces in China to evaluate the early impact of COVID-19 on TB services and to document interventions that were adopted to maintain the continuity services for TB patients during the pandemic. We use these data to identify additional opportunities that will improve the ability of TB programs to maintain essential services during this crisis. While health systems and underlying epidemiology differ between countries, we believe that sharing China's experience can inform the design of locally tailored strategies to maintain essential TB services during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shen, X.; Sha, W.; Yang, C.; Pan, Q.; Cohen, T.; Chen, S.; Cai, Q.; Kan, X.; Zong, P.; Zeng, Z.; Tan, S.; Liang, R.; Bai, L.; Xia, J.; Wu, S.; Sun, P.; Wu, G.; Cai, C.; Wang, X.; Ai, K.; Liu, J.; Yuan, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20150292v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20150292v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
205,ABO polymorphism and SARS-CoV-2 infection - a meta-analysis,"At present, existing evidence about the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and ABO blood group polymorphism is preliminary and controversial. In this meta-analysis we investigate this association and determine SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals odds of having a specific blood group compared to controls. We performed a systematic search on MEDLINE and LitCovid databases for studies published through July 12, 2020. 7 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, including a total of 13 subgroups of populations (7524 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 2962160 controls). We analysed the odds of having each blood group among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared with controls. Random-effects models were used to obtain the overall pooled odds ratio (OR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed in order to explore the source of heterogeneity and results consistency. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are more likely to have blood group A (pooled OR 1.21; 95%CI: 1.08-1.37) and less likely to have blood group O (pooled OR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.66-0.87). Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms at the basis of this association, which may affect the kinetics of the pandemic according to the blood group distribution within the population.","Golinelli, D.; Boetto, E.; Maietti, E.; Fantini, M.

206,COVID-19 national lockdown in Morocco: impacts on air quality and public health,"On the 20th April 2020, the end date of the first strict lockdown period in Morocco, 2 403 410 cases of the corona Virus were confirmed globally. The number of Morocco confirmed cases attended 2990, while 12 746 were suspected and 143 deaths were recorded. Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 worldwide and in Morocco, almost all avoidable activities in the country were prohibited since the kingdom announced activities reduction on March 16, 2020 and then general lockdown with reduced industrial activities on March 20, 2020. This study aims at comparing the air quality status in Casablanca and Marrakech, two large cities from Morocco, before the pandemic and during the lockdown situation to show whether COVID-19 compelled-anthropogenic activities lockdown may have saved lives by restraining ambient air pollution than by preventing infection. We found that, during the quarantine, NO2 dropped by -12 g/m3 in Casablanca and -7 g/m3 in Marrakech. PM2.5 dropped by -18 g/m3 in Casablanca and -14 g/m3 in Marrakech. CO dropped by -0.04 mg/m3 in Casablanca and -0.12 mg/m3 in Marrakech. This air pollution reduction had created human health benefits and had reduced mortality and saved lives mainly from cardiovascular diseases.","khomsi, k.; Najmi, H.; Amghar, H.; Chelhaoui, Y.; Souhaili, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146589v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146589v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
207,Single-Cell Omics Reveals Dyssynchrony of the Innate and Adaptive Immune System in Progressive COVID-19,"A dysregulated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a critical role in severe COVID-19. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the virus causes lethal immunopathology are poorly understood. Here, we utilize multi-omics single-cell analysis to probe dynamic immune responses in patients with stable or progressive manifestations of COVID-19, and assess the effects of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody. Coordinated profiling of gene expression and cell lineage protein markers reveals a prominent type-1 interferon response across all immune cells, especially in progressive patients. An anti-inflammatory innate immune response and a pre-exhaustion phenotype in activated T cells are hallmarks of progressive disease. Skewed T cell receptor repertoires in CD8 T cells and uniquely enriched V(D)J sequences are also identified in COVID-19 patients. B cell repertoire and somatic hypermutation analysis are consistent with a primary immune response, with possible contribution from memory B cells. Our in-depth immune profiling reveals dyssynchrony of the innate and adaptive immune interaction in progressive COVID-19, which may contribute to delayed virus clearance and has implications for therapeutic intervention.","Unterman, A.; Sumida, T.

208,"Impact of climatic, demographic and disease control factors on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in large cities worldwide","We are now over seven months into a pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and global incidence continues to rise. In some regions such as the temperate northern hemisphere there are fears of ""second waves"" of infections over the coming months, while in other, vulnerable regions such as Africa and South America, concerns remain that cases may still rise, further impacting local economies and livelihoods. Despite substantial research efforts to date, it remains unresolved as to whether COVID-19 transmission has the same sensitivity to climate and seasonality observed for other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza. Here we investigate any empirical evidence of seasonality using a robust estimation framework. For 304 large cities across the world, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using logistic growth curves fitted to cumulative case data. We then assessed evidence for association with climatic variables through mixed-effects and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression while adjusting for city-level variation in demographic and disease control factors. We find evidence of association between temperature and R0 during the early phase of the epidemic in China only. During subsequent pandemic spread outside China, we instead find evidence of seasonal change in R0, with greater R0 within cities experiencing shorter daylight hours (direct effect coefficient = -0.247, p = 0.006), after separating out effects of calendar day. The effect of daylight hours may be driven by levels of UV radiation, which is known to have detrimental effects on coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In the global analysis excluding China, climatic variables had weaker explanatory power compared to demographic or disease control factors. Overall, we find a weak but detectable signal of climate variables on the transmission of COVID-19. As seasonal changes occur later in 2020, it is feasible that the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 may shift in a detectable manner. However, rates of transmission and health burden of the pandemic in the coming months will be ultimately determined by population factors and disease control policies.","Metelmann, S.; Pattni, K.; Brierley, L.; Cavalerie, L.; Caminade, C.; Blagrove, M.

209,Confirmed central olfactory system lesions on brain MRI in COVID-19 patients with anosmia: a case-series,"Objective: Anosmia has been listed as a key-symptom associated with the COVID-19 infection. Because it often occurs without any sign of rhinitis, lesions of the central olfactory system have been suspected. To date, however, there is no evidence that anosmia caused by SARS-CoV2 could be the result of brain damage. Methods: We conducted a case-series on 10 consecutive COVID-19 patients who reported anosmia. Each patient prospectively underwent a validated olfactory test (Sniffin Sticks test) and a brain MRI. Results: Hypersignal intensity lesions of the central olfactory system were found in 3 subjects on 3D T2 FLAIR and 2D T2 High Resolution images with a lesion involving the olfactory bulbs and/or the orbitofrontal cortex. These 3 subjects showed a severe and persistent loss of smell on the olfactory test. Mucosal hyperplasia of the upper nasal cavities was found in two other subjects with significant smell disorders. There was no MRI anomaly in two subjects with good smell restoration. Conclusions: Anomalies of the central olfactory system could be responsible for anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to assess the impact on long-term functional prognosis of these lesions.","Girardeau, Y.; GALLOIS, Y.; DE BONNECAZE, G.; ESCUDE, B.; LAFONT, C.; CHATELLIER, G.; MARX, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148692v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148692v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
210,"COVID-19 ANXIETY AMONG FRONTLINE NURSES: PREDICTIVE ROLE OF ORGANISATIONAL SUPPORT, PERSONAL RESILIENCE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT","Aim: This study examines the relative influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety in frontline nurses. Background: Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among frontline nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardised scales. Results: Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support, personal resilience and organisational support predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Conclusions: Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. Implication for Nursing Management: COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, L.; De los Santos, J.

211,Estimating the size of undetected cases of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Europe: An upper bound estimator,"Background: While the number of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely available, an understanding of the extent of undetected cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic. The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2 (detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being asked is: How many cases have actually occurred? Methods: We propose an upper bound estimator under cumulative data distributions, in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods. Results: We focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April 17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93 times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrap based intervals are rather narrow. Conclusions: Many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic spreads differently.","Rocchetti, I.; Boehning, D.; Holling, H.; Maruotti, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
212,"IgG antibody seroconversion and the clinical progression of COVID-19 pneumonia: A retrospective, cohort study","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe acute respiratory failure. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is known as the mechanism for severe forms of other coronavirus diseases. The clinical progression of COVID-19 before and after IgG antibody seroconversion was investigated. Methods: Fifty-three patients with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCT)-confirmed COVID-19 viral pneumonia with or without respiratory failure were retrospectively investigated. The timing of the first IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2-positive date, as well as changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and blood lymphocyte numbers, was assessed using serial preserved blood samples. Findings: Ten patients recovered without oxygen therapy (mild/moderate group), 32 patients had hypoxemia and recovered with antiviral drugs (severe/non-ICU group), and 11 patients had severe respiratory failure and were treated in the ICU (6 of them died; critical/ICU group). The first IgG-positive date (day 0) was observed from 5 to 18 days from the onset of disease. At day 0, a CRP peak was observed in the severe and critical groups, whereas there was no synchronized CRP peak on day 0 in the mild/moderate group. In the severe/non-ICU group, the blood lymphocyte number increased (P=0.0007) and CRP decreased (P=0.0007) after day 0, whereas CRP did not decrease and the blood lymphocyte number further decreased (P=0.0370) in the critical/ICU group. Interpretation: The respiratory failure due to COVID-19 viral pneumonia observed in week 2 may be related to an antibody-related mechanism rather than uncontrolled viral replication. In the critical form of COVID-19, inflammation was sustained after IgG seroconversion.","Kurashima, K.; Kagiyama, N.; Ishiguro, T.; Takaku, Y.; Nakajima, H.; Shibata, S.; Matsui, Y.; Takano, K.; Isono, T.; Nishida, T.; Kawate, E.; Hosoda, C.; Kobayashi, Y.; Takayanagi, N.; Yanagisawa, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20154088v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20154088v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
213,Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in an entirely PCR-sampled and quarantined community after a COVID-19 outbreak - the CoNAN study,"Background: Due to the substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses many SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting immunity in a defined population. Methods: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study in the previously quarantined community Neustadt-am-Rennsteig, Germany six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with 49 cases identified by PCR screening of all 883 inhabitants. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine the rate of seroconversion in children; ii.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; iii.) to investigate the rate of virus persistence. Findings: We enrolled 626 participants (71% of the community population). All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative; while a total of 8.4% (52 of 620 tested) had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two independent tests. Twenty of the antibody positive participants had previously a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. On the contrary, of those 38 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 20 (52.6%) were antibody positive. Interpretation: Several antibody tests conducted six weeks after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 did not detect all previously PCR-positive tested individuals.

Most studies support an association between increased mortality rates and holidays. We compare the effect of the number of holiday days per week on the overall mortality rate in the Israeli population. Between the years 2000-2020, we see a significantly reduced mortality rate in weeks containing national holidays. We observed the same trend in all-cause mortality during the 3-weeks COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. As the Israeli health care system, and specifically the hospitals function at a very high capacity year-round, we propose that a reduced medical service utilization during the holidays and the COVID-19 lockdown period may contribute to lower mortality rates.","Rasnic, R.; Klinger, D.; Ofer, D.; Comay, Y.; Linial, M.; Bachmat, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155259v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155259v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
215,"Hospital mortality and resource implications of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in London, UK: a prospective cohort study","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significant impact on the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (UK), with over 33 000 cases reported in London by July 6, 2020. Detailed hospital-level information on patient characteristics, outcomes and capacity strain are currently scarce but would guide clinical decision-making and inform prioritisation and planning. Methods We aimed to determine factors associated with hospital mortality and describe hospital and ICU strain by conducting a prospective cohort study at a tertiary academic centre in London, UK. We included adult patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up until hospital discharge or 30 days. Baseline factors that are associated with hospital mortality were identified via semi-parametric and parametric survival analyses. Results Our study included 429 patients; 18% of them were admitted to ICU, 52% met criteria for ICU outreach team activation and 61% had treatment limitations placed during their admission. Hospital mortality was 26% and ICU mortality was 34%. Hospital mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, increasing baseline C-reactive protein level and dyspnoea at presentation. COVID-19 resulted in substantial ICU and hospital strain, with up to 9 daily ICU admissions and 41 daily hospital admissions, to a peak census of 80 infected patients admitted in ICU and 250 in the hospital. Management of such a surge required extensive reorganisation of critical care services with expansion of ICU capacity from 69 to 129 beds, redeployment of staff from other hospital areas and coordinated hospital-level effort. Conclusions COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of mortality for patients treated on the ward and the ICU and required substantial reconfiguration of critical care services. This has significant implications for planning and resource utilization.","Vlachos, S.; Wong, A.; Metaxa, V.; Canestrini, S.; Lopez Soto, C.; Periselneris, J.; Lee, K.; Patrick, T.; Stovin, C.; Abernethy, K.; Albudoor, B.; Banerjee, R.; Juma, F.; Al-Hashimi, S.; Bernal, W.; Maharaj, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155069v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155069v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
216,Use of Powered Air-Purifying Respirator(PAPR) by healthcare workers for preventing highly infectious viral diseases -a systematic review of evidence,"Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at particular risk during pandemics and epidemics of highly virulent diseases with significant morbidity and case fatality rate. These diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed Evidence Profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend toward greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR were identified . Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

217,Longitudinal dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. Methods Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. Conclusions These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, K.; Long, Q.-X.; Deng, H.-J.; Hu, J.; Gao, Q.-Z.; Zhang, G.-J.; He, C.-L.; Huang, L.-Y.; Hu, J.-L.; Chen, J.; Tang, N.; Huang, A.-L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20151159v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
218,Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Hospital Admissions,"Importance: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. Furthermore, with its increasing incidence, more has been learned about the risk factors that can make certain groups more at risk of contracting the disease or have worse outcomes. We aim to identify any discrepancy in the hospitalization rate by race/ethnicity of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, and through this, analyze the risks of these groups in an effort to call out for attention to the circumstances that make them more vulnerable and susceptible to disease. Observations: Analysis indicates that patients identified as non-Hispanic White and Asian/Pacific Islander in hospital admission data are underrepresented in COVID-19 admissions. Patients identified as non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian have a disproportionate burden of hospital admissions, suggesting an increased risk of more severe disease. Conclusions and Relevance: There is a disproportionate rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations found among non-Hispanic Blacks. Further investigation is imperative to identify and remediate the reason(s) for increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infections requiring hospital admission.

Main Outcome Measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. Results Median age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162/451) were under 12 months old, and 57% (256/450) were male. 56% (224/401) were White, 12% (49/401) South Asian and 10% (40/401) Black. 43% (195/451) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria. 17% of children (72/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %, 3/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity. Twelve percent of children (36/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23/33) vs 43% (101/237), p=0.005). Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61% (22/36) vs 15% (40/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13/29) vs 11% (19/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11/28) vs 7% (12/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10/27) vs (13% (24/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17/30) vs 31% (60/192), p =0.012) than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109/L (30% (10/33) vs 10% (24/232), p=0.004). Conclusions Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MIS-C is the severe end of a spectrum of disease. Study registration ISRCTN66726260","Swann, O. V.; Holden, K.

220,Calming the Cytokine Storm - Splenic Ultrasound for Treating Inflammatory Disorders and Potentially COVID-19,"Hyperinflammation and uncontrolled cytokine release, which can be seen in severe cases of COVID-19, require therapy to reduce the innate immune response without hindering necessary adaptive immune mechanisms. Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1B; and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFNgamma- and NFKB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","Graham, R.

221,Dynamics and future of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host,"Forecasting trends in COVID-19 infections is vital for the global economy, national governments and physical and mental well-being. Using the per capita number of new cases as a proxy for the abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the number of deaths as a measure of virulence, the dynamics of the pandemic and the outcomes emerging from it are examined for three locations (England, Italy and New York State). The data are analysed with a new version of a population dynamics model that combines exponential/logistic growth with time-varying carrying capacity, allowing predictions of persistence or extinction of the virus. In agreement with coevolutionary theory, the model suggests a transition from exponential virus growth to low abundance, coupled with reduced virulence, during colonisation of the alternate human host. The structure of the model allows a straightforward assessment of key parameters, which can be contrasted with standard epidemiological models and interpreted with respect to ecological and evolutionary processes and isolation policies.","Gillman, M.; Crokidakis, N.

222,Progressive worsening of the respiratory and gut microbiome in children during the first two months of COVID-19,"Children are less susceptible to COVID-19 and manifests lower morbidity and mortality after infection, for which a multitude of mechanisms may be proposed. Whether the normal development of gut-airway microbiome is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. We demonstrate that COVID-19 alters the respiratory and gut microbiome of children. Alteration of the microbiome was divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome distortion persisted in 7/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others. Disturbed development of both gut and respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis in children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as predisposition to an increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.","Xu, R.; Liu, P.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Q.; Zeng, M.; Ma, Y.; Jin, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152181v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True

Comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact-tracing data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh reveal stark contrasts from epidemics affecting high-income countries, with 92.1% of cases and 59.7% of deaths occurring among individuals <65 years old. The per-contact risk of infection is 9.0% (95% confidence interval: 7.5-10.5%) in the household and 2.6% (1.6-3.9%) in the community. Superspreading plays a prominent role in transmission, with 5.4% of cases accounting for 80% of infected contacts. The case-fatality ratio is 1.3% (1.0-1.6%), and median time-to-death is 5 days from testing. Primary data are urgently needed from low- and middle-income countries to guide locally-appropriate control measures.","Laxminarayan, R.; Wahl, B.; Dudala, S.

Here, we analyze the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia in March and April 2020. Combining phylogeographic analysis with travel history data, we estimate that the sampled viral diversity has originated from 67 closely timed introductions into Russia, mostly in late February to early March. All but one of these introductions came from non-Chinese sources, suggesting that border closure with China has helped delay establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia. These introductions resulted in at least 9 distinct Russian lineages corresponding to domestic transmission. A notable transmission cluster corresponded to a nosocomial outbreak at the Vreden hospital in Saint Petersburg; phylodynamic analysis of this cluster reveals multiple (2-4) introductions each giving rise to a large number of cases, with a high initial effective reproduction number of 3.7 (2.5-5.0).","Komissarov, A.

225,Seroprevalence of Hospital Staff in Province with Zero COVID-19 cases,"BACKGROUND. COVID-19 seroprevalence data has been scarce, especially in less developed countries with a relatively low infection rate. METHODS. A locally developed rapid IgM/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff in Ranong hospital which located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from April 17 to May 17, 2020. A total of 844 participants were tested; 82 of which were tested twice with one month apart. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) RESULTS. Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), none had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG). Female staffs seemed to have higher IgM seropositive than male staffs (1.0% vs. 0.5%). None of the participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or a history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptom and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, history of close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case, history of close contact with suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION. COVID-19 antibody test could detect a substantial number of hospital staffs who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 case. Antibody testing should be encouraged for mass screening, especially in asymptomatic healthcare workers.","Nopsopon, T.; Pongpirul, K.; Chotirosniramit, K.; Jakaew, W.; Kaewwijit, C.; Kanchana, S.; Hiransuthikul, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151944v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151944v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
226,Acute Demyelinating Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in COVID-19 infection: A Case Series.,"Objective: To report three patients infected with COVID-19 with severe respiratory syndrome requiring intubation, who developed acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment. Early recognition of this complication and treatment is important to avoid long term complications.","McCuddy, M.; Kelkar, P.; Zhao, Y.; Wicklund, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20126730v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20126730v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True

Classified as essential, such workers cannot shelter at home. Therefore, knowledge and preventive behaviors are important to reduce COVID-19 spread in the community. (2) Methods: Respondents for 67 families with at least one farmworker (FWF) and 38 comparable families with no farmworkers (non-FWF) in North Carolina completed a telephone survey in May, 2020. The survey queried knowledge of COVID-19, perceptions of its severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors. Detailed data were collected to document household members' social interaction and use of face coverings. (3) Results: Knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods was high in both groups, as was its perceived severity. Non-FWF had higher self-efficacy for preventing infection. Both groups claimed to practice preventive behaviors, though FWF emphasized social avoidance and non-FWF emphasized personal hygiene. Detailed social interactions showed high rates of inter-personal contact at home, at work, and in the community with more mask use in non-FWF than FWF. (4) Conclusions: Despite high levels of knowledge and perceived severity for COVID-19, these immigrant families were engaged in frequent interpersonal contact that could expose community members and themselves to COVID-19.","Quandt, S.

228,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load is Associated with Increased Disease Severity and Mortality,"The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and risk of disease progression remains largely undefined in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load from participants with a diverse range of COVID-19 severity, including those requiring hospitalization, outpatients with mild disease, and individuals with resolved infection. SARS-CoV-2 plasma RNA was detected in 27% of hospitalized participants and 13% of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, were associated with increased risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 viral load may aid in the risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 and its role in disease pathogenesis should be further explored.","Fajnzylber, J.

This study aims to evaluate public's perceived importance of the NPIs imposed for COVID-19 control in personal and public health protection in Greece. Methods: This cross-sectional online study, enrolled 657 adult participants from the general Greek population in order to assess their beliefs and evaluate possible factors that influence their perceptions as regards NPI importance in personal and public health protection. Results: Overall, Greeks considered NPIs important for health protection.

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of humans COVID-19. Methods: We searched the Medline, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1, to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND, animal models, hamsters, nonhuman primates, macaques, rodent, mice, rats, ferrets, rabbits, cats, and dogs. Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. Findings: 13 peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n=13), mice (n=7), ferrets (n =4), hamsters (n= 4), and cats (n =1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in Rhesus macaques, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled cytokine storm or coagulopathy. Conclusions: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype.

In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, peace of mind will come only with community-based SARS-CoV-2 screening, where many people are tested on a regular basis. However, recent models show that short sample-to-answer turnaround time will be a critical property of effective screening strategies (Larremore et al., 2020). Here, we describe an RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 in raw saliva that takes about 45 minutes from sample to answer and requires only simple equipment (pipettes and a heating source). The assay has a limit of detection of 100 virions per microliter, and targets two separate regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By combining rapid sample-to-answer turnaround time with the use of saliva, our RT-LAMP assay provides a low-complexity, portable, and robust system for real-time community screening.","Meyerson, N.

232,Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of aggregate data from randomised controlled trials,"Objectives: To assess the overall effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory infection (ARI), and to identify factors modifying this effect. Design: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Pre-specified sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration or dosing regimen. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Standard RCT Number (ISRCTN) registry from inception to May 2020. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Double-blind RCTs of supplementation with vitamin D or calcidiol, of any duration, were eligible if they were approved by a Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Results: We identified 40 eligible RCTs (total 30,956 participants, aged 0 to 95 years). Data were obtained for 29,841 (96.5%) of 30,909 participants in 39 studies. For the primary comparison of vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo, the intervention reduced risk of ARI overall (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; P for heterogeneity 0.009). No statistically significant effect of vitamin D was seen for any of the sub-groups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects were seen for trials in which vitamin D was given using a daily dosing regimen (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93); at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89); and for a duration of [&le;]12 months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but two trials. A funnel plot showed asymmetry, suggesting that small trials showing non-protective effects of vitamin D may have been omitted from the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation was safe and reduced risk of ARI, despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials. The overall effect size may have been over-estimated due to publication bias. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU vitamin D for up to 12 months. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires investigation.","Jolliffe, D.; Camargo, C.

233,Creating a safe workplace by universal testing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and healthcare workers in the electrophysiology unit having no symptoms of COVID-19: a multi-center experience,"Background: As the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients. Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology (EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment of a risk-free operating environment. Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670) Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020 (p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after 2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the procedure. Conclusion: Universal testing to identify positive cases was helpful in creating and maintaining a safe working environment without exposing patients and staff to new infections in the EP unit at the hospital.","Mohanty, S.; Lakkireddy, D.; Trivedi, C.; MacDonald, B.; Mayedo, A.; Della Rocca, D.

234,Risk Adjusted Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for the Management of COVID-19 in South Africa,"A global analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 indicates that these can be classified using the stringency index proposed by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker(OxCGRT) team. The world average for the coefficient that linearises the level of transmission with respect to the OxCGRT stringency index is s= 0.01{+/-}0.0017 (95%C.I.). The corresponding South African coefficient is s= 0.0078{+/-}0.00036 (95%C.I.), compatible with the world average. Here, we implement the stringency index for the recently announced 5-tier regulatory alert system. Predictions are made for the spread of the virus for each alert level. Assuming constant rates of recovery and mortality, it is essential to increase s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. Monitoring of s becomes essential to controlling the post-lockdown phase. Data from the Gauteng province obtained in May 2020 has been used to re-calibrate the model, where s was found increase by 20% with respect to the period before lockdown. Predictions for the province are made in this light.","Stevenson, F.

235,"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in adolescent students and their teachers in Saxony, Germany (SchoolCoviDD19): very low seropraevalence and transmission rates","Background: School closures are part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic control measures in many countries, based on the assumption that children play a similar role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 as they do in transmitting influenza. We therefore performed a SARS-CoV-2 seropraevalence-study in students and teachers to assess their role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methods: Students grade 8-11 and their teachers in 13 secondary schools in eastern Saxony, Germany, were invited to participate in the SchoolCoviDD19 study. Blood samples were collected between May 25th and June 30th, 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were assed using chemiluminescence immunoassay technology and all samples with a positive or equivocal test result were re-tested with two additional serological tests. Findings: 1538 students and 507 teachers participated in this study. The seropraevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 0.6%. Even in schools with reported Covid-19 cases before the Lockdown of March 13th no clusters could be identified. 23/24 participants with a household history of COVID-91 were seronegative. By using a combination of three different immunoassays we could exclude 16 participants with a positive or equivocal results after initial testing. Interpretation: Students and teachers do not play a crucial role in driving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a low prevalence setting. Transmission in families occurs very infrequently, and the number of unreported cases is low in this age group, making school closures not appear appropriate as a strategy in this low prevalence settings.

236,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in PCR positive patients: comparison of nine tests in relation with clinical data,"Background. High number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are available in different formats, detect different types of antibodies, and use different target proteins. Sensitivity of these tests varies and could be also related to clinical symptoms and testing time. Methods. Serum samples from 97 COVID-19 patients and 100 controls were tested with 9 antibody tests (SNIBE, Epitope, Euroimmun, Roche, Abbott, DiaSorin, Biosensor, LIPS N, and LIPS S-RBD). The results were analyzed in context of clinical data. Findings. Positivity rate was of tests was following: N-LIPS test (91.8% cases), Epitope (85.6%), Abbott and in-house LIPS S-RBD (both 84.5%), Roche (83.5%), Euroimmun (82.5%), DiaSorin (81.4%), SNIBE (70.1%), and Biosensor (64.9%). Agreement between tests varied (71-95%). Correlation between patient symptoms score and antibody value was test-dependent: varied from strongest in LIPS N (rho=0.41; p<0.001) to nonsignificant (LIPS S-RBD). Testing time from symptoms influenced sensitivity in some tests more than anothers. Interpretation. Sensitivity of tests varied highly and combination of different tests may improve it. Relation of results to symptoms and testing time was test-dependent. Thus, some antibody tests seems to be more sensitive to detect antibodies early and in asymptomatic patients than others. Funding. Study was funded by SYNLAB Estonia and Estonian Research Council grant PRG377.","Naaber, P.; Hunt, K.; Pesukova, J.; Haljasmagi, L.; Rumm, P.; Peterson, P.; Hololejenko, J.; Eero, I.; Jogi, P.; Toompere, K.; Sepp, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20149617v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20149617v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
237,HIGH VERSUS STANDARD DOSES OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS WITH AN ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: a controlled observational comparative study.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the increasing evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids for the treatment of moderate-severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, no data are available about the potential role of high doses of steroids for these patients. METHODS: All consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center were selected, including those treated with steroids and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients were allocated to the high doses (HD, 250mg/day or more of methylprednisolone) of corticosteroids or the standard doses (SD, 1.5mg/kg/day or more of methylprednisolone) at discretion of treating physician. The primary endpoint was the mortality between both cohorts and secondary endpoints were the risk of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) or death and the risk of developing a severe ARDS. RESULTS: 573 patients were included: 428 (74.7%) men, with a median (IQR) age of 64 (54-73) years. In HD cohort, a worse baseline respiratory situation was observed and male sex, older age and comorbidities were significantly more common. After adjusting by baseline characteristics, HD were associated with a higher mortality than SD (adjusted-OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.58-3.83, p<0.001) and with an increased risk of needing MV or death (adjusted-OR 2.50, p=0.001). Conversely, the risk of developing a severe ARDS was similar between groups. Interaction analysis showed that HD increased mortality exclusively in elderly patients. CONCLUSION: Our real-world experience advises against exceeding 1-1.5mg/kg/day of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 with an ARDS, especially in older subjects. This reinforces the rationale of modulating rather than suppressing immune responses in these patients.","Monreal, E.; Sainz de la Maza, S.; Natera-Villalba, E.; Beltran-Corbellini, A.; Rodriguez-Jorge, F.; Fernandez-Velasco, J.

238,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Parkinson's Disease,"Objective: To rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a survey focusing on the presentation and complications of COVID-19 infection and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among those not infected. Methods: Individuals with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete an online survey between April 23-May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnosis, we compared the frequency of symptoms and poor outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed the effects of the pandemic on access to medical care and other services, and in PwPD, its effects on PD symptoms. Results: Among 5,429 PwPD and 1,452 without PD, 77 reported a COVID-19 diagnosis (51 PwPD, 26 without PD). Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. PwPD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) PD symptoms. PwPD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened PD motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for PwPD living alone, and for those with lower income and non-white race. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of PwPD.","Brown, E. G.; Chahine, L. M.; Goldman, S.

239,Role of intermediate care unit admission and non-invasive respiratory support during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity. We developed a triage strategy including non-invasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. Objectives The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the intermediate care unit. Method Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-days mortality and predictors of ICU admission. Results One hundred fifty seven patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99) and Body Mass Index (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the intermediate care unit. Among the 72 patients transferred from the ICU, 60/72 (83%) presented neurological complications. Conclusions Non-invasive respiratory support including High-Flow Nasal Oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID pandemic, intermediate care units may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, O.; Leidi, A.; Darbellay-Farhoumand, P.; Carballo, S.; Reny, J.-l.; Adler, D.; Bollen Pinto, B.; Rossel, A.; Serratrice, J.; Agoritsas, T.; Stirnemann, J.; Marti, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
240,Going beyond clinical routine in SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing - A multiplex corona virus antibody test for the evaluation of cross-reactivity to endemic coronavirus antigens,"Given the importance of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as a global benchmark for immunity, a detailed analysis is needed to (i) monitor seroconversion in the general population, (ii) understand manifestation and progression of the disease, and (iii) predict the outcome of vaccine development. Currently available serological assays utilize single analyte technologies such as ELISA to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) protein. To measure individual antibody (IgG and IgA) responses against SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1, we developed a multiplexed immunoassay (CoVi-plex), for which we included S and N proteins of these coronaviruses in an expanded antigen panel. Compared to commercial in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests our CoVi-plex achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity when analyzing 310 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 866 uninfected individuals. Simultaneously we see high IgG responses against hCoVs throughout all samples, whereas no consistent cross reactive IgG response patterns can be defined. In summary, our CoVi-plex is highly suited to monitor vaccination studies and will facilitate epidemiologic screenings for the humoral immunity toward pandemic as well as endemic coronaviruses.","Becker, M.; Strengert, M.; Junker, D.; Kerrinnes, T.; Kaiser, P.

241,Disease-associated antibody phenotypes and probabilistic seroprevalence estimates during the emergence of SARS-CoV-2,"Serological studies are critical for understanding pathogen-specific immune responses and informing public health measures (1,2). By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable (3,4), we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1-9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths. Seroprevalence in these otherwise healthy cohorts increased steeply before beginning to level-off, following the same trajectory as the Stockholm region deaths over this time period.","Castro Dopico, X.; Hanke, L.; Sheward, D.

244,Epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 disease in India during nationwide lockdown phase- An empirical data-based analysis and its implications on interrupting the transmission,"Background: Covid-19 disease is pandemic in more than 85% of the countries in the world, with about 10 million cases and 0.5 million deaths as on July 2, 2020. In India reporting of the first case was on January 30, 2020, and to prevent rapid community spread of the disease nationwide lockdown phase was imposed from March 25- June 1, 2020. Our objective was to assess various epidemiological measures during the lockdown phase. Methods: We used daily reporting of confirmed cases by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India during the period March 19-June 1, 2020. Using statistical packages STATA version 16.0 and R-packages in R-version 4.0, we fitted statistical distributions, estimated generation time and Basic Reproduction numbers. Results: During the lockdown phase, the daily per cent increase in the cumulative number of cases showed negative exponential growth with 0.022 as an instantaneous rate of decrease. Day specific incidence rate per million revealed the exponential pattern with 0.069 as the instantaneous rate of increase per day, which accounted for the doubling time of the disease (10 days; 95% CI: 9.25-10.93). Case fatality rate (2.92%; 95% CI: 2.82% -3.02%) and overall death rate was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.87-1.41) per million. were abysmally low. Statistical distribution fitting of new cases found to be satisfactory with Gamma distribution. Basic reproduction numbers 1.83 (95% CI: 1.82-1.83) was less. Conclusion: In India, with a population density of about 450 per Km2, the virulent of COVID-19 transmission was interrupted significantly with 70 days lockdown during the early transmission stage.

245,Joint CBC-ICT Interpretation for the pre-surgical screening of COVID 19 asymptomatic cases: A cross-sectional study,"Background On 26th, February 2020, first cases of COVID 19 were confirmed in Pakistan. Since then, surgeries were halted in a bid to prevent transmission. However, since such a long halt is infeasible, a general protocol of screening the carriers, especially asymptomatic carries, is a dire need of time. The objective of our study is to propose an economically feasible protocol of COVID 19 screening. Simple but effective screening strategies can help to restore the workings of hospital surgical departments. Methods We analyzed the clinical data of patients turning up for elective surgeries at the Rawal General Hospital (RGH), Islamabad from the 24th of March to the 15th of May, 2020. Asymptomatic patients with negative COVID 19 contact and travel histories were screened with COVID 19 Immunochromatography (ICT) IgM / IgG Ab Test. Complete blood count (CBC) was done and interpreted in conjunction with the ICT results. Results 39 patients with a mean age of 49 years were studied. The result of ICT for COVID-19 was positive in 9 cases (23%). The entire positive ICT patients population expressed significantly lower lymphocyte count (p<0.01); 8 patients had high monocyte count (p<0.05) whereas only 4 patients had a combined high neutrophil and monocyte count (P<0.05). All of these four patients with high neutrophil count were females. The combined interpretation of CBC and ICT IgM / IgG Ab Test had a high accuracy in diagnosing asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers that were later confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Conclusion We propose that joint CBC-ICT interpretation should be adopted on a large scale to help in the diagnoses of asymptomatic carriers as both tests are simple and inexpensive and thus suit the developing countries limited health budget.

246,Multisectoral collaboration for pandemic response and operational support of critical care and emergency departments,"Background: In March 2020, an influx of admissions in COVID-19 positive patients threatened to overwhelm healthcare facilities in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. Exacerbating this problem was a shortage of diagnostic testing capability, resulting in a delay in time-to-result return. An improvement in diagnostic testing availability and timeliness was necessary to improve the allocation of resources and ultimate throughput of patients. The management of a COVID-19 positive patient or patient under investigation requires infection control measures that can quickly consume personal protective equipment (PPE) stores and personnel available to treat these patients. Critical shortages of both PPE and personnel also negatively impact care in patients admitted with non-COVID-19 illnesses. Methods: A multisectoral partnership of healthcare providers, facilities and academicians created a molecular diagnostic lab within an academic research facility dedicated to testing inpatients and healthcare personnel for SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of the laboratory was to provide a temporary solution to the East Baton Rouge Parish healthcare community until individual facilities were self-sustaining in testing capabilities. We describe the partnership and the impacts of this endeavor by developing a model derived from a combination of data sources, including electronic health records, hospital operations, and state and local resources. Findings: Our model demonstrates two important principles: the impact of reduced turnaround times (TAT) on potential differences in inpatient population numbers for COVID-19 and savings in PPE attributed to the more rapid TAT. Interpretation: Overall, we provide rationale for and demonstration of the utility of multisectoral partnerships when responding to public health emergencies.","Christofferson, R. C.; O'Neal, H.

247,"A deterministic, age-stratified, extended SEIRD model for investigating the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Belgium","As a response to the rapidly rising number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the Belgian governments imposed strict social contact restrictions on March 13th, 2020. After nearly two months, the curve was successfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually relaxed. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions are not yet available so it is expected that preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, hence the need for well-informed models. In this study, we built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified-SEIRD model with detailed hospital dynamics. Because the hospitalization data for Belgium are not made publically available by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Sciensano), we computed the hospitalization parameters based on data from 370 patients treated in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. The basic reproduction number was estimated as R0 = 2.83 in March 2020 and the model fits the hospitalization and ICU admission incidence under lockdown measures well. Despite the relaxation of social restrictions, hospitalizations have been steadily declining. We recomputed the basic reproduction number under lockdown release and found that it had to be as low as R0 = 0.73 to explain the endemic trend. We further found that although the basic reproduction number in the population older than 70 years was smaller than one, this group compromises nearly half of the expected hospitalizations. This indicates that the protection of the elderly may be the most efficient way to reduce strain on the public health care system in case of another SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Alleman, T.

248,Broncho-alveolar inflammation in COVID-19 patients: a correlation with clinical outcome,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly reached pandemic proportions. We conducted a prospective study to assess deep lung inflammatory status in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 33 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swab admitted to the Intensive care unit (ICU) (n=28) and to the Intermediate Medicine Ward (IMW) (n=5). We analyze the differential cell count, ultrastructure of cells and Interleukin(IL)6, 8 and 10 levels. ICU patients showed a marked increase in neutrophils (72%, 60-81), lower lymphocyte (8%, 4-12) and macrophages fractions (17%, 11-27) compared to IMW patients (3%, 2-17, 15%, 6-26 and 74%, 58-90, respectively) (p<0.01). Ultrastructural study from ICU patients showed viral-like particles in cytopathic mononuclear cells however extensive cytopathic damage in all cell lineages. Immunostaining with anti-viral capsid and spike antibodies specifically immunoreacted with BAL cells, mostly cytopathic ones. IL6 and IL8 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in IMW (IL6 p<0.01, IL8 p<0.0001), and also in patients who did not survive (IL6 p < 0.05, IL8 p = 0.05 vs. survivors). IL10 did not show a significant variation between groups. Dividing patients by treatment received, lower BAL concentrations of IL6 were found in patients treated with steroids as compared to those treated with tocilizumab (p<0.1) or antivirals (p<0.05).

249,Are we ready when COVID-19 vaccine is available? Study on nurses' vaccine hesitancy in Hong Kong,"Introduction: Nurses are considered a trustworthy source of vaccine-related information to build public confidence in vaccination. This study estimated nurses' influenza vaccine uptake and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined the corresponding psychological antecedents. Methods : A cross-sectional online survey among nurses was conducted during the main COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components (i.e., confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), work stress and COVID-related work demands (i.e., insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported. Results: The influenza vaccination coverage and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively, among 1205 eligible nurses. Influenza vaccine uptake was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs, whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility towards the vaccine. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. Conclusion: Vaccine uptake/intention was well predicted by the 5C constructs. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, communities are not ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake.","Kwok, K. O.; Li, K. K.; Wei, W. I.; Tang, K. H.; Wong, S. Y.

250,Cultural values predict national COVID-19 death rates,"National responses to a pandemic require populations to comply through personal behaviors that occur in a cultural context. Here we show that aggregated cultural values of nations, derived from World Values Survey data, have been at least as important as top-down government actions in predicting the impact of COVID-19. Whereas trust in institutions predicts lower COVID-19 deaths per capita, secular- rationalism and cosmopolitanism each predict more deaths. The effects of these cultural values register more strongly than government efficiency. This suggests that open democracies may face greater challenges in limiting a pandemic, and that all nations should consider their cultural values as actionable parameters in their future preparations.","Ruck, D.

251,The psychological impact of 'mild lockdown' in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey under a declared state of emergency,"This study examined the psychological distress caused by non-coercive lockdown (mild lockdown) in Japan. An online survey was conducted with 11,333 people (52.4% women; mean age = 46.3 {+/-} 14.6 years, range = 18-89 years) during the mild lockdown in the seven prefectures most affected by COVID-19 infection. Over one-third (36.6%) of participants experienced mild-to-moderate psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K6] score 5-12), while 11.5% reported serious psychological distress (K6 score [&ge;] 13). The estimated prevalence of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score [&ge;] 10) was 17.9%. Regarding the distribution of K6 scores, the proportion of those with psychological distress in this study was significantly higher when compared with the previous national survey data from 2010, 2013, and 2016. Healthcare workers, those with a history of treatment for mental illness, and younger participants (aged 18-19 or 20-39 years) were particularly vulnerable. Psychological distress severity was influenced by specific interactional structures of risk factors: high loneliness, poor interpersonal relationships, COVID-19-related sleeplessness and anxiety, deterioration of household economy, and work and academic difficulties. Flexible approaches that are optimised for the difficulties specific to each individual through cross-disciplinary public-private initiatives are important to combat lockdown-induced mental health problems.","Yamamoto, T.; Uchiumi, C.; Suzuki, N.; Yoshimoto, J.; Murillo-Rodriguez, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156125v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156125v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,True
252,Obesity has an impact on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Background Recent observational studies suggested obesity to be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality as well as the role of body fat distribution in this context still unclear. Thus, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated the causal impact of obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods Obesity was quantified by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these anthropometric measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al. (n=322154); Shungin et al. (n=232101)) and for the COVID-19 susceptibility (n=1079768) as well as hospitalization (n = 900687) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Causal estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques. Results Genetically predicted BMI was significantly associated (per one SD) with both, COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.72; P-value=0.001) and hospitalization (OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.14; P-value=0.006). WC was associated with the susceptibility (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.78; P-value=0.015) but not with hospitalization. WHR was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","Freuer, D.; Linseisen, J.; Meisinger, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153825v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153825v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
253,"Place and causes of acute cardiovascular mortality during the COVID19 pandemic: retrospective cohort study of 580,972 deaths in England and Wales, 2014 to 2020","Importance. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. This is key information to optimise messaging to the public and enable health resource planning.","Wu, J.; Mamas, M.; Mohamed, M.; Kwok, C.

254,A sensitive and affordable multiplex RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is need for sensitive, specific and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom are symptomatic. The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR, with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside internal controls that monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by nose-and-throat swabbing. The inclusion of a human control probe in our assay provides additional information that could help reduce false negative rates.","Reijns, M. A.; Thompson, L.; Acosta, J. C.; Black, H.

256,COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. before vs. after relaxation of social distancing measures,"Background: All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia implemented social distancing measures that interrupted transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reduced morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 51 jurisdictions have since begun to relax these measures, albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Methods: We obtained state-level data on implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures. We fitted mixed-effects linear regression models with a random effect for state, specifying the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt, the expected number of secondary infections generated by each index case given date-specific population susceptibility and risk behavior). Explanatory variables included time in days, implementation period (1-21 days prior to first relaxation of any statewide social distancing measure vs. time from relaxation through May 28, 2020), and a time-by-period product term. Results: During the three weeks prior to relaxation, the estimated Rt was declining by an average of 0.0016 units per day (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.0025 to -0.0008). At the time of initial relaxation, states had reported a median 7,628 cases (range, 337-361,313) and 289 COVID-attributable deaths (range, 7-28,663), and the median estimated Rt was 1.0 (range, 0.8-1.3) (i.e., the median rate of epidemic growth across states was estimated to be zero). After the first relaxation of statewide social distancing measures, the estimated Rt began increasing by an average of 0.0047 units per day (95% CI, 0.0037 to 0.0058) compared with the pre-relaxation period. If these trends continue, the estimated state-level Rt would reach an average value of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03-1.07) by 30 days after relaxation and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.18) by 60 days. A similar upward trajectory in the estimated Rt was observed after relaxation of statewide restrictions on internal movement. Conclusions: Relaxation of U.S. statewide social distancing measures was associated with a subsequent reversal of an earlier downward trend in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in states with less active epidemics at the time of relaxation.","Tsai, A.

257,"Community-level SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey in urban slum dwellers of Buenos Aires City, Argentina: a participatory research.","Background By July 1st, the incidence rate of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.9% in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City. This study aimed to establish the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 three months after the first case was reported. Methods Between June 10th and July 1st, a cross-sectional design was carried out on people over 14 years old, selected from a probabilistic sample of households. A finger prick sample was tested by ELISA to detect IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Multilevel model was applied to understand sector, household and individual conditions associated with seroconvert. Results Prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). Among the IgG positive cases, 15% reported having compatible symptoms at some point in the past two months. There is evidence of within-household clustering effect (rho=0.52; 95% IC 0.36-0.67); living with a PCR-confirmed case doubled the chance of being SARS-CoV2 IgG positive (OR 2.13; 95% IC 1.17-3.85). The highest risk of infection was found in one of the most deprived areas of the slum, the Bajo autopista sector. Discussion High seroprevalence is shown, for each symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed diagnosis, 9 people were IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probable asymptomatic) infections. Given that transmission among family members is a leading driver of the disease`s spread, it is unsurprising that crowded housing situations in slums are directly associated with higher risk of infection and consequently high seroprevalence levels. This study contributes to the understanding of population immunity against SARS-CoV2, its relation to living conditions and viral spread, for future decision making.","Figar, S.; Pagotto, V.; Luna, L.; Salto, J.; Wagner Manslau, M.; Mistchenko, A.; GAMARNIK, A.; Gomez Saldano, A.

258,"Space-time patterns, change, and propagation of COVID-19 risk relative to the intervention scenarios in Bangladesh","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a significant public health threat worldwide. As of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 7.7 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths. The impacts are substantial particularly in developing and densely populated countries like Bangladesh with inadequate health care facilities, where COVID-19 cases are currently surging. While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not be pragmatically implementable in developing countries primarily due to social and economic reasons (i.e. poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). To shed light on COVID-19 transmission dynamics and impacts of NPI scenarios, e.g. social distancing, this study conducted emerging pattern analysis using the space-time scan statistic at district and thana (i.e. a sub-district or 'upazila' with at least one police station) levels in Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka city, respectively. We found that the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh are currently exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Dhaka megacity remains as the highest risk ""active"" cluster since early April. The space-time progression of COVID-19 infection, when validated against the chronicle of government press releases and newspaper reports, suggests that Bangladesh have experienced a community level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020) primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus-affected countries in the Europe and the Middle East. A linkage is evident between the violation of NPIs and post-incubation period emergence of new clusters with elevated exposure risk around Bangladesh. This study provides novel insights into the space-time patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and recommends pragmatic NPI implementation for reducing disease transmission and minimizing impacts in a resource-scarce country with Bangladesh as a case-study example.","Masrur, A.; Yu, M.; Luo, W.; Dewan, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154757v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154757v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

260,The age and sex distribution of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in India,"Using anonymous publicly available data on COVID-19 infections and gross outcomes in India, the age and sex distribution of infections and fatalities is studied. The age structure in the count of infections is not proportional to that in the population, indicating the role of either co-morbidity or differential attack rate. There is a strong age structure in the sex ratio of cases, with the female to male ratio being about 50% on average. The ratio drops between puberty and menopause. No such structure is visible in the sex ratio of fatalities. The overall age distribution of fatalities is consistent with a model which uses the empirical age structure of infections and a previous determinations of age structured IFR. The average IFR for India is then expected to be 0.4% with a 95% CrI in [0.22%, 0.77%].","Gupta, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153957v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153957v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

262,Application of ARIMA and Holt-Winters forecasting model to predict the spreading of COVID-19 for India and its states,"The novel Corona-virus (COVID-2019) epidemic has posed a global threat to human life and society. The whole world is working relentlessly to find some solutions to fight against this deadly virus to reduce the number of deaths. Strategic planning with predictive modelling and short term forecasting for analyzing the situations based on the worldwide available data allow us to realize the future exponential behaviour of the COVID-19 disease. Time series forecasting plays a vital role in developing an efficient forecasting model for a future prediction about the spread of this contagious disease. In this paper, the ARIMA (Auto regression integrated moving average) and Holt-Winters time series exponential smoothing are used to develop an efficient 20- days ahead short-term forecast model to predict the effect of COVID-19 epidemic. The modelling and forecasting are done with the publicly available dataset from Kaggle as a perspective to India and its five states such as Odisha, Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The model is assessed with correlogram, ADF test, AIC and MAPE to understand the accuracy of the proposed forecasting model.","Panda, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153908v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153908v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
263,Graduate students significantly more concerned than undergraduates about returning to campus in the era of COVID-19,"Introduction: As students return to colleges and universities in the fall of 2020, it is important to understand their perception of risk and their desire for in person versus online learning, which may differ between undergraduate and graduate students. Methods: We anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their preferred learning strategies once back. We compared Strongly agree/Agree with Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree using a chi-square test. Results: Graduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% masters vs 20.8% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Graduate students were also less likely to prefer to be in the classroom as much as possible in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% masters vs 74.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Most were not concerned about their ability to conduct research. Students generally supported wearing of facemasks indoors. Conclusions: There are important differences in perception of risk and desire for online versus in-person learning between undergraduate and graduate students.

264,Interpreting Deep Ensemble Learning through Radiologist Annotations for COVID-19 Detection in Chest Radiographs,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We observe that: (i) ensemble approaches improved classification and localization performance; and, (ii) inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helped guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, S.; Sornapudi, S.; Alderson, P.

265,Moderate to vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior change in self-isolating adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: A cross-sectional survey exploring correlates,"Background: The self-distancing measures imposed major changes in daily life routine. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the changes (pre-versus during pandemic) in time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in selfisolating Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) to explore correlates of MVPA and SB. Methods: A cross-sectional self-report online survey, evaluating the time spent in MVPA and SB pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, variables, and time in self-isolation were also obtained. Changes in MVPA and SB and their correlates were explored using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: A total of 877 participants (72.7% women, 53.7% young adults [18-34 years]) were included. Overall, participants reported a 59.7% reduction (95%CI:35.6 to 82.2) in time spent on MVPA during the pandemic. Time spent in SB increased 42.0% (95%CI:31.7 to 52.5). Greater reductions in MVPA and/or increases in SB were seen in younger adults, those not married, those employed and those with a self-reported previous diagnosis of a mental disorder. Conclusions: People in self-isolation significantly reduced MVPA levels and increased SB. Public health strategies should be implemented during epidemic times to mitigate the impact of self-isolation on MVPA and SB, particularly in vulnerable groups.","Schuch, F.; Bulzing, R.; Meyer, J.; Lopez-Sanchez, G.; Grabovac, I.; Willeit, P.; Vancampfort, D.; Caperchione, C.; Sadarangani, K.; Werneck, A.; Ward, P.; Tully, M.; Smith, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154559v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154559v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
266,Cell-based culture of SARS-CoV-2 informs infectivity and safe de-isolation assessments during COVID-19,"Background The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples collected from persons recovered from COVID-19 does not necessarily indicate shedding of infective virions. By contrast, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based culture likely indicates infectivity, but there are limited data on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR. Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3. Findings Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 was only successfully isolated from samples with Ctsample values <32, including in 28/181 (15%), 19/42 (45%) and 9/11 samples (82%) collected from outpatients, inpatients and ICU patients, respectively. The mean duration from symptom onset to culture positivity was 4.5 days (range 0-18 days). SARS-CoV-2 was significantly more likely to be isolated from samples collected from inpatients (p<0.001) and ICU patients (p<0001) compared with outpatients, and in samples with lower Ctsample values.

267,A parsimonious model for spatial transmission and heterogeneity in the COVID-19 propagation,"Raw data on the cumulative number of deaths at a country level generally indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19 disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","Roques, L.; Bonnefon, O.; Baudrot, V.; Soubeyrand, S.; Berestycki, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154740v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154740v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
268,Direct-to-Consumer Chat-Based Remote Care Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective. To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020. Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals). Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely. Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","Zeltzer, D.; Vodonos Zilberg, A.; Paz, Y.

Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001). Individuals who engaged in more physical activity reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Although there were no differences in physical activity between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon the physical activity habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations.

270,"The utility of established prognostic scores in COVID-19 hospital admissions: a multicentre prospective evaluation of CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA","INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing yet, due to the lack of a COVID-19 specific tool, clinicians must use pre-existing illness severity scores for initial prognostication. However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting. New prognostic tools including a focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse are needed. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","Frost, F.; Bradley, P.; Tharmaratnam, K.; North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR),; Wootton, D.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS Corona Virus detection by PCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the Corona virus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors. Results: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunging from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed to select the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased Corona virus detection rates. Conclusions: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed. Several meteorological factors were associated with the Corona virus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the Corona virus detection rate.","Anastasiou, O.

272,Controlling COVID-19 via test-trace-quarantine,"COVID-19 containment efforts in the United States so far have largely focused on physical distancing, including school and workplace closures. However, these interventions have come at an enormous societal and economic cost. Here, we use an agent-based model, calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region, to investigate the feasibility of alternative control strategies, focusing on ""test-trace-quarantine"": a combination of (a) routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, (b) tracing and testing their known contacts, and (c) placing their contacts in quarantine. We assess the requirements for implementing this strategy, including its robustness to low compliance, delays, and other factors such as variability in overall transmission rates. We find that for the Seattle setting, if mask compliance remains high and schools remain closed, realistic levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control under a return to full workplace and community mobility.","Kerr, C.

273,"COVID-19 effective reproductive ratio determination: An application, and analysis of issues and influential factors","An essential indicator of COVID-19 transmission is the effective reproduction number (Rt), the number of cases which an infected individual is expected to infect at a particular moment of time; curves of the evolution of Rt over time (transmission curves) reflect the impact of preventive measures and whether an epidemic is controlled. We have created a Shiny/R web application with user-selectable features: open data sources with daily COVID-19 incidences from all countries and many regions, customizable preprocessing options (smoothing, proportional increment, backwards distribution of negative corrections, etc), different MonteCarlo-Markov-Chain estimates of the generation time or serial interval distributions and state-of-the-art Rt estimation frameworks (EpiEstim, R0). We have analyzed the impact of these factors in the obtained transmission curves. We also have obtained curves at the national and sub-national level and analyzed the impact of epidemic control strategies, superspreading events, socioeconomic factors and outbreaks. We conclude that country wealth and, to a lesser extent, mitigation strategies, were associated with poorer epidemic control. Dataset quality was an important factor, and sometimes dictated the necessity of time series smoothing. We couldn't find conclusive evidence regarding the impact of alleged superspreading events. In the reopening phase, outbreaks had an impact on transmission curves.

We aim to estimate time-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 for India using a reproducible framework. Methods: Daily COVID-19 case incidence time series for India and its states were obtained from https://api.covid19india.org/ and pre-processed. The Bayesian approach was adopted to quantify transmissibility at a given location and time, as indicated by the instantaneous reproduction number (Reff). The analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using -EpiEstim_2.2-3- package. Serial interval distribution was estimated using -uncertain_si- algorithm with inputs of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of mean serial intervals as 5.1, 1.2, 3.9 and 7.5 days respectively; and mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of standard deviations of the serial interval as 3.7, 0.9, 2.3, and 4.7 respectively with 100 simulations and moving average of seven days. Results. A total of 9,07,544 cumulative incident cases till July 13th, 2020 were analysed. Daily COVID-19 incidence in the country was seen on the rise; however, transmissibility showed a decline from the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic in India. The maximum Reff reached at the national level during the study period was 2.57 (sliding week ending April 4th, 2020). Reff on July 13th, 2020 for India was 1.16 with a range from 0.59 to 2.98 across various states/UTs. Conclusion.

Life expectancy at birth dropped 1.7 and 1.9 years for females and males relative to the 2019 levels, respectively. Lifespan inequality also fell over the same period. Conclusions: Quantifying excess deaths and their impact on life expectancy at birth provides a more comprehensive picture of the full COVID-19 burden on mortality. Whether mortality will return to - or even fall below - the baseline level remains to be seen as the pandemic continues to unfold and diverse interventions are put in place.","Aburto, J.

276,"Associations between Demographic Characteristics, Perceived Threat, Perceived Stress, Coping Responses and Adherence to COVID-19 Prevention Measures among Healthcare Students in China: A Cross-Sectional Survey with Implications for the Control of COVID-19","Objectives: To investigate the associations between demographic characteristics, perceived threat, perceived stress, coping responses and adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures in Chinese Healthcare students. Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China. Self-administered questionnaires were collected via online platform in April 2020. Participants: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme in Hong Kong or Fujian. Setting: Students were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian (a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province). The institutions offered various healthcare programmes in degree or sub-degree levels. Main outcome measures: Compliances to social distancing and personal hygiene measures were assessed by 10-item Social Distancing Scale and 5-item Personal Hygiene Scale respectively. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the compliance outcomes. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data (Chi-square X2=27.27, df=17, P=0.044; X2/df=1.61; GFI=0.998, CFI=0.997, TLI=0.992, RMSEA=0.015). Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","Tang, A. C. Y.; Kwong, E. W. Y.; Chen, L.; Cheng, W. L.

277,Are the upper bounds for new SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany useful?,"At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus, called SARS--CoV--2, was reported in China and later in other parts of the world. First infections were reported in Germany by the end of January and on March 16th the federal government announced a partial lockdown in order to mitigate the spread. Since the dynamics of new infections started to slow down, German states started to relax the confinement measures as to the beginning of May. As a fall back option, a limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days was introduced for each city or district in Germany. If a district exceeds this limit, measures to control the spread of the virus should be taken. Based on a multi--patch SEAIRD--type model, we will simulate the effect of choosing a specific upper limit for new infections. We investigate, whether the politically motivated bound is low enough to detect new outbreaks at an early stage. Subsequently, we introduce an optimal control problem to tackle the multi--criteria problem of finding a bound for new infections that is low enough to avoid new outbreaks, which might lead to an overload of the health care system, but is large enough to curb the expected economic losses.","Bock, W.; Goetz, T.; Jayathunga, Y.; Rockenfeller, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155036v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155036v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

Methods: Rapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric properties. Results: 84 studies were included. Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, 2 studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, 5 studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (2 studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. Discussion: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","Holland, A. E.; Malaguti, C.; Hoffman, M.; Lahham, A.; Burge, A.

It was found that no seasonality in this form {varepsilon} occurs as far as a seasonality forcing behavior {varepsilon}' assumes most of the influence in SARS-COV-2 spreading patterns. Putting in order {varepsilon}' of influence, there were identified three main forms of SARS-COV-2 of transmission behavior: during epidemics growth, policies are the main stronger seasonality forcing behavior of the epidemics followed by secondary and weaker environmental and urban spaces driving patterns of transmission. At outbreaks and control phase, environmental and urban spaces are the main seasonality forcing behavior due to policies/ALE limitations to address heterogeneity and confounding scenario of infection. Finally regarding S and R compartments of SIR model equations, control phases are the most reliable phase to predictive analysis. These seasonality forcing behaviors cause environmental driven seasonality researches to face hidden or false observations due to policy/ALE interventions for each country and urban spaces characteristics. And also, it causes policies/ALE limitations to address urban spaces and environmental seasonality instabilities, thus generating posterior waves or uncontrolled patterns of transmission (fluctuations). All this components affect the SARS-COV-2 spreading patterns simultaneously being not possible to observe environmental seasonality not associated intrinsically with policies/ALE and urban spaces, therefore conferring to these three forms of transmission spreading patterns, specific regions of analysis for time series data extraction.","Telles, C.

280,The impact of host resistance on cumulative mortality and the threshold of herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2,"It is widely believed that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) required to prevent a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 is in excess of 50% for any epidemiological setting. Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. The drop in HIT is proportional to the fraction of the population resistant only when that fraction is effectively segregated from the general population; however, when mixing is random, the drop in HIT is more precipitous. Significant reductions in expected mortality can also be observed in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths and suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.","Lourenco, J.; Pinotti, F.; Thompson, C.; Gupta, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154294v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154294v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

282,Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a nationwide registry,"Background: The clinical description of the neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients is still underway. This study aims to provide an overview of the spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible. Results: We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). The most common neurological diseases were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (67/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (15/222, 6.8%). Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days in COVID-19 associated encephalopathy, 7 (5-10) days in encephalitis, 12 (7-18) days in acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome and 18 (15-28) days in Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Brain MRI of encephalitis patients showed heterogeneous acute non vascular lesion in 14/21 patients (66.7%) with associated small ischemic lesion or microhemorrhages in 4 patients. Among patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, 13/57 (22.8%) had multi territory ischemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16/57 (28.1%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with pleocytosis in 18 patients (18.6%). A SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed in 75 patients and was positive only in 2 encephalitis patients. Among patients with encephalitis, ten out of 21 (47.6%) fully recovered, 3 of whom received corticosteroids (CS). Less common neurological manifestations included isolated seizure (8/222, 3.6%), critical illness neuropathy (8/222, 3.6%), transient alteration of consciousness (5/222, 2.3%), intracranial hemorrhage (5/222, 2.3%), acute benign lymphocytic meningitis (3/222, 1.4%), cranial neuropathy (3/222, 1.4%), single acute demyelinating lesion (2/222, 0.9%), Tapia syndrome (2/222, 0.9%), cerebral venous thrombosis (1/222, 0.5%), sudden paraparesis (1/222, 0.5%), generalized myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia (1/222, 0.5%), bilateral fibular palsy (1/222, 0.5%) and isolated neurological symptoms (headache, anosmia, dizziness, sensitive or auditive symptoms, hiccups, 15/222, 6.8%). The median (IQR) follow-up of the 222 patients was 24 (17-34) days with a high short-term mortality rate (28/222, 12.6%).

In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded. We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking by governments and international organizations.","Huang, J.; Liu, X.; Zhang, L.; Yang, K.; Chen, Y.; Huang, Z.; Liu, C.; Lian, X.; Wang, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.","Hota, B.; Stein, B.; Lin, M.; Tomich, A.; Segreti, J.; Weinstein, R.

We conducted systematic literature search via Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang Database, CNKI, and medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, to identify all original studies that reports on coagulation parameters (D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB) during COVID-19 infection. Thereafter, we compared the coagulation parameters between less severe and more severe cases. All Statistical analyses were performed via Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were included from 25 studies. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibited significantly higher levels of D-dimer, PT, and FIB (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9%; SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2 42.4% respectively).

After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios.

287,Observational Study of Chlorpromazine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,"On the grounds of its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, chlorpromazine has been suggested to be effective treatment for Covid-19. We examined the association between chlorpromazine use and respiratory failure among all hospitalized adults with Covid-19 at the 39 Greater Paris University hospitals since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis adjusting for numerous potential confounders. We used a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Of the 12,217 adult inpatients with a positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test included in the analyses, 57 (0.47%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint occurred in 29 patients (50.9%) exposed to chlorpromazine and 1,899 patients (15.6%) who were not. In the main analysis, there was a positive significant association between chlorpromazine use and the outcome (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.56, p=0.019), while a Cox regression in a matched analytic sample yielded non-significant association (1.38; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.09, p=0.123).

Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated their causal effects on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable causal effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy), and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects of public mobility in retail and recreational areas, awareness measured by searches for ""corona"" in Google, and higher rainfall, leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases. This comprehensive causal analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","Steiger, E.; Mussgnug, T.; Kroll, L.

Here we determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (range N=21,000-157,000) from the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) database. We fit a set of probability distribution functions and estimate a symptom-onset-to-death mean of $15.2$ days for Brazil, which is lower than earlier estimates of 17.8 days based on early Chinese data. A joint Bayesian subnational model is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability distribution function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-discharge. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, I.; Mellan, T.

290,Utrametric diffusion model for spread of covid-19 in socially clustered population: Can herd immunity be approached in Sweden?,"We present a new mathematical model of disease spread reflecting specialties of covid-19 epidemic by elevating the role social clustering of population. The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus' spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our purely diffusional model.","Khrennikov, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154419v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154419v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
291,Higher Comorbidities and Early Death is Characteristic of Hospitalized African-American Patients with COVID-19,"Background African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 'obese' range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","Gupta, R.; Agrawal, R.; Bukhari, Z.; Jabbar, A.; Wang, D.; Diks, J.; Alshal, M.; Emechebe, D.

292,Protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial of normobaric versus hyperbaric oxygen therapy for hypoxemic COVID-19 patients,"Background: At least 1 in 6 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and receiving supplemental oxygen will die of complications. More than 50% of patients with COVID-19 that receive invasive treatment such as mechanical ventilation will die in hospital. Such impacts overwhelm the limited intensive care unit resources and may lead to further deaths given inadequate access to care. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is defined as breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure higher than 1.4 atmosphere absolute (ATA). HBOT is safe, including for lungs, when administered by experienced teams and is routinely administrated for a number of approved indications. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests clinical improvement when hypoxemic COVID-19 patients are treated with HBOT. Objective: We aim to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for improving oxygenation, morbidity, and mortality among hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Methods and analysis: This trial is a sequential Bayesian Parallel-group, individually Randomized, Open, Blinded Endpoint controlled trial. Admitted hypoxemic COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen (without high flow and mechanical ventilation) to maintain a satisfying tissue oxygenation will be eligible to participate. The anticipated sample size of 234 patients is informed by data from a treatment trial of COVID patients recently published. The intervention group will receive one HBOT per day at 2.0 ATA for 75 minutes. Daily HBOT will be administered until either the patient does not require any oxygen supplementation or requires any type of mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygenation until day 28 post-randomization. Patients in the control group will receive the current standard of care treatment (no HBOT). The primary outcome of this trial will be the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale assessed on Day 7 post-randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, days with oxygen supplementation, oxygen flow values to obtain a saturation by pulse oximetry [&ge;]90%, intensive care admission and length of stay, days on invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen, sleep quality, fatigue, major thrombotic events, the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale on Day 28; mortality, safety); (b) biological outcomes (plasma inflammatory markers); and (c) health system outcomes (cost of care and cost-effectiveness). Predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria have been specified. The analytical approach for the primary outcome will use a Bayesian proportional odds ordinal logistic semiparametric model. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Bayesian posterior probabilities will be calculated every 20 patients to assess accumulating evidence for benefit or harm. A planned subgroup analysis will be performed for pre-specified variables known to impact COVID-19 prognosis and/or HBOT (biologic sex and age). Discussion: Based on the mortality rate and substantial burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, it is imperative that solutions be found. HBOT is a non-invasive and low-risk intervention when contraindications are respected. The established safety and relatively low cost of providing HBOT along with its potential to improve the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients make this intervention worth studying, despite the current limited number of HBOT centres. If this trial finds that HBOT significantly improves outcome and prevents further deterioration leading to critical care for severe COVID-19 patients, practice will change internationally. If no benefit is found from the intervention, then the current standard of care (no HBOT) will be supported by level I evidence.","Boet, S.; Katznelson, R.; Castelluci, L.

293,Improved COVID-19 Serology Test Performance by Integrating Multiple Lateral Flow Assays using Machine Learning,"Mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been complicated by the inaccessibility and, in some cases, inadequacy of testing options to detect present or past infection. Immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFAs) are a cheap and scalable modality for tracking viral transmission by testing for serological immunity, though systematic evaluations have revealed the low performance of some SARS-CoV-2 LFAs. Here, we re-analyzed existing data to present a proof-of-principle machine learning framework that may be used to inform the pairing of LFAs to achieve superior classification performance while enabling tunable False Positive Rates optimized for the estimated seroprevalence of the population being tested.","Mowery, C.

294,The First Consecutive 5000 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 from Qatar; a Nation-wide Cohort Study,"Background There are limited data on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes at a national level, and none after 60 days of follow up. The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. Outcomes included all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and risk factors for admission to ICU. Results Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P <0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P <0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. Conclusions In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","Omrani, A. S.; Almaslamani, M. A.; Daghfal, J.; Alattar, R.

295,Possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context,"The determination of the adequate time for house confinement and when social distancing restrictions should end are now two of the main challenges that any country has to face in an effective battle against. The possibility of a new outbreak of the pandemic and how to avoid it is, nowadays, one of the primary objectives of epidemiological research. In this work, we go deep in this subject by presenting an innovative compartmental model, that explicitly introduces the number of active cases, and employing it as a conceptual tool to explore the possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context. We incorporated the impact of starting, inattention, and end of restrictive social policies on the time evolution of the pandemics via time-in-run corrections to the infection rates. The magnitude and impact on the epidemic due to post-social restrictive policies are also studied. The scenarios generated by the model can help authorities to determine an adequate time and population load that may be allowed to reassume normal activities.","Santamaria-Holek, I.; Castano, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154526v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154526v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
296,Evaluation of NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome characterisation,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been performed at unprecedented rate worldwide with the use of very diverse Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2/8 and 1/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct [&ge;]25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","Charre, C.; Ginevra, C.; Sabatier, M.; Regue, H.; Brun, S.; Burfin, G.; Scholtes, C.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Bal, A.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False

298,"Low SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence based on anonymized residual sero-survey before and after first wave measures in British Columbia, Canada, March-May 2020","Background: The province of British Columbia (BC) has been recognized for successful SARS-CoV-2 control, with surveillance data showing amongst the lowest case and death rates in Canada. We estimate sero-prevalence for two periods flanking the start (March) and end (May) of first-wave mitigation measures in BC. Methods: Serial cross-sectional sampling was conducted using anonymized residual sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network, including children and adults in the Greater Vancouver Area (population ~3 million) where community attack rates were expected to be highest. Screening used two chemiluminescent immuno-assays for spike (S1) and nucleocapsid antibodies. Samples sero-positive on either screening assay were assessed by a third assay targeting the S1 receptor binding domain plus a neutralization assay. Age-standardized sero-prevalence estimates were based on dual-assay positivity. The May sero-prevalence estimate was extrapolated to the source population to assess surveillance under-ascertainment, quantified as the ratio of estimated infections versus reported cases. Results: Serum collection dates spanned March 5-13 and May 15-27, 2020. In March, two of 869 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.28% (95%CI=0.03-0.95). Neither specimen had detectable neutralizing antibodies. In May, four of 885 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.55% (95%CI=0.15-1.37%). All four specimens had detectable neutralizing antibodies. We estimate ~8 times more infections than reported cases. Conclusions: Less than 1% of British Columbians had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 when first-wave mitigation measures were relaxed in May 2020. Our findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in BC, but also substantial residual susceptibility. Further sero-survey snapshots are planned as the pandemic unfolds.","Skowronski, D. M.; Sekirov, I.; Sabaiduc, S.; Zou, M.; Morshed, M.; Lawrence, D.; Smolina, K.; Ahmed, M.

300,Comparison of the COVID-19 infection risks by close contact and aerosol transmission,"A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human-to-human transmission by close contact where large respiratory droplets play a significant role has been established as the main transmission route. At the same time the transmission by small aerosol is getting increasing attention. There is no distinct boundary between droplets and aerosol in nature so it is natural to investigate the infection risk due to aerosol. Here, we utilized a newly developed dose-response relation, combined with a box model for the exposure estimation, to quantitatively evaluate the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol transmission and compared with the risk due to close contact. The results indicated that the median infection risk via aerosol transmission was about 3.7x10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5x10-6 to 4.4x10-4) for one hour of exposure in a room with the size of 10 m (width)x10 m (length)x3 m (height) with one infected individual in it. The risk was more than three orders of magnitude lower than the risk at short distance, about 12.8% within 1 m, based on a meta-analysis. A simple exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90xD+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be utilized to characterize the magnitude of infection risk in the considered scenario based on the distance D from the infected individual. With prolonged exposure duration and large exposed population, the infection caused by aerosol transmission could be considerable, thus it is necessary to be cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in such situations.","Zhang, X.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152900v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152900v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
301,Increased serum levels of soluble TNF-α receptor is associated with mortality of ICU COVID-19 patients,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to almost 100 countries, infected over 10M patients and resulted in 505K deaths worldwide as of 30th June 2020. The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 requiring ventilation is acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with multi-functional failure as a result of a cytokine storm with increased serum levels of cytokines such as TNF- and IL-6 being reported. TNF- levels are increased during the cytokine storm in very ill patients and soluble receptors for IL-6 and IL-2 are present in the blood of COVID-19 patients, Objectives: To elucidate the involvement of serum levels of soluble TNF-Receptor of severe and mild COVID-19 patients to determine for severity of disease. Method: We recruited 16 severe COVID-19 patients in the ICU on ventilator support and 26 milder COVID-19 patients who were hospitalised but not within the intensive care unit (ICU) between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. After harvesting of whole blood the serum was isolated and soluble TNF-Receptor levels measured by ELISA. Results: Serum levels of the usually inhibitory soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFaR1) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients at admission to ICU. High serum levels of sTNFaR1 were associated with mortality of severe COVID-19 patients treated within ICU.

Although a number of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, we still lack an understanding of the overall landscape of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in COVID-19 patients. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of BCR repertoires collected over multiple time points during an infection to characterize statistical and dynamical signatures of the B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 patients with different disease severities. Based on principled statistical approaches, we determined differential sequence features of BCRs associated with different disease severity. We identified 34 significantly expanded rare clonal lineages shared among patients as candidates for a specific response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified natural emergence of a BCR with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a number of patients.

303,COVID-19 misinformation: mere harmless delusions or much more? A knowledge and attitude cross-sectional study among the general public residing in Jordan,"Abstract Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic.

304,Quantifying the impacts of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19: an empirical analysis from 344 cities of China,"Abstract Objective Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), human mobility restriction measures have raised controversies, partly due to inconsistent findings. Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","Tan, J.; Xiong, Y.-q.; Zhao, S.; Liu, C.; Huang, S.; Lu, X.; Thabane, L.; Xie, F.; Sun, X.; Li, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20148668v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20148668v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
305,Covid-19 infection and attributable mortality in UK Long Term Care Facilities: Cohort study using active surveillance and electronic records (March-June 2020),"Background: Rates of Covid-19 infection have declined in many countries, but outbreaks persist in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) who are at high risk of severe outcomes. Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

306,Mechanistic Transmission Modeling of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship Demonstrates the Importance of Aerosol Transmission,"Background The current prevailing position is that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted primarily through large respiratory droplets within close proximity (i.e., 1-2 m) of infected individuals. However, quantitative information on the relative importance of specific transmission pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., droplets, aerosols, and fomites across short- and long-range distances) remains limited. Methods To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We developed a framework that combines stochastic Markov chain and negative exponential dose-response modeling with available empirical data on mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and human behaviors, which informs a modified version of the Reed-Frost epidemic model to predict daily and cumulative daily case counts on the ship. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors, including the magnitude of droplet and aerosol emissions from infected individuals, the infectious dose for deposition of droplets and aerosols to the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and others. Findings A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations yields insights into the likely values for uncertain parameters and quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases aboard the ship across the entire simulation time period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of large respiratory droplets and small respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%. Short-range transmission was the dominant mode after passenger quarantine began, albeit due primarily to aerosol transmission, not droplets. Interpretation Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions. Although cruise ships represent unique built environments with high ventilation rates and no air recirculation, these findings underscore the importance of implementing public health measures that target the control of inhalation of aerosols in addition to ongoing measures targeting control of large droplet and fomite transmission, not only aboard cruise ships but in other indoor environments as well.","Azimi, P.; Keshavarz, Z.; Cedeno Laurent, J.

307,"Post lockdown COVID-19 seroprevalence and circulation at the time of delivery, France","Background To fight the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown has been decreed in many countries worldwide. The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever, myalgia and anosmia, was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic in order to adapt public health measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as social distancing and teleworking for this specific population.","Mattern, J.; Vauloup-Fellous, C.; Zakaria, H.; Benachi, A.; Carrara, J.; Letourneau, A.; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, N.; De Luca, D.; Doucet-Populaire, F.; Vivanti, A.

We assessed the effects of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, on intra-hospital mortality and development of positive cultures in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. In this study, patients with COVID 19 admitted in the ICU who were treated with tocilizumab plus standard care were enrolled and compared to controls. Main outcome: 1) intra-hospital mortality; Secondary Outcomes: 1) the need for renal replacement therapy, 2) use of antibiotics and positive culture, and 3) inflammatory and oxygenation markers. Results: There was no difference in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, use of antibiotics or positive cultures between the two groups. The use of corticosteroids was more frequent in the treatment group. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and WBC (white blood cells) counts declined significantly faster in the treatment group. Oxygenation markers rose significantly higher in patients in the tocilizumab group as compared to controls.

310,Association between epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 infection and ABO blood group types,"Background: Covid-19 pandemic is the most critical challenge nowadays for the manhood, and the infection and death cases are still speedily increasing. Since there are no available vaccine and specifically effective treatment, to break the infectious way of the pandemic remains the unique measure to efficiently combat Covid-19 infection. Understanding factors that affect the Covid-19 infection can help make better balance between activity restriction and infection dynamics. This study sought to investigate association between Covid-19 infection and blood type distribution. Methods: The big data provided by World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University were taken to assess epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 infection. Growth rate and doubling time of infection and death cases, reproductive number, infection and death cases in the mid-exponential phase were analyzed in relation to blood type distribution. Results: Growth rate of infection and death cases correlated significantly to blood type A proportion of the population positively while to blood type B proportion negatively. In comparison with lower blood type A population (< 30%) people with higher blood type A ([&ge;] 30%) had more infection and death cases in the early exponential phase, higher growth rates, and shorter case doubling time for infection and death. Discussion: Covid-19 infection is significantly associated with blood type distribution and people with blood type A are more susceptible to Covid-19 infection and have higher epidemic dynamics and higher case fatality rate. The results of this study provide important and useful information for fighting Covid-19 pandemic.","Liu, Y.; Steinacker, J.

311,CHEST DRAIN AEROSOL GENERATION IN COVID-19 AND EMISSION REDUCTION USING A SIMPLE ANTI-VIRAL FILTER,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by significant in-hospital virus transmission and deaths among healthcare workers. Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 microns). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs, reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count/cubic foot (pc/ft3) within six channel sizes: 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and >10 microns. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p-values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS Aerosol emissions increased with increased air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3-3 microns). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 microns) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc/ft3 at 1, 3 and 5 L/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H2O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSIONS A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter. These data should be considered when designing measures to reduce in-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2.","DUFFY, C.; KIDD, A.; FRANCIS, S.; TSIM, S.; MCNAUGHTON, L.; FERGUSON, K.; FERGUSON, J.; RODGERS, G.; McGROARTY, C.; SAYER, R.; BLYTH, K.

312,Endocrine disrupting chemicals and COVID-19 relationships: a computational systems biology approach,"Background: Patients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. Objectives: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. Methods: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. Results: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. Conclusions: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Q.; Coumoul, X.; Grandjean, P.; Barouki, R.; Audouze, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
313,"Effect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: Preliminary results from a multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial.","Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of in vitro activity, uncontrolled data, and small randomized studies. Methods: The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is a randomized, controlled, open-label, platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We report the preliminary results for the comparison of hydroxychloroquine vs. usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results: 1561 patients randomly allocated to receive hydroxychloroquine were compared with 3155 patients concurrently allocated to usual care. Overall, 418 (26.8%) patients allocated hydroxychloroquine and 788 (25.0%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.23; P=0.18). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60.3% vs. 62.8%; rate ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99) and those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25). There was no excess of new major cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality but was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.","Horby, P.; Mafham, M.; Linsell, L.; Bell, J.

315,Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States,"Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.","Hu, Y.; Riley, L.

316,Work Related and Personal Predictors of Covid 19 transmission,"The paper provides new evidence from a survey of 2000 individuals in the US and UK related to predictors of Covid-19 transmission. Specifically, it investigates work and personal predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker, evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, risk-aversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to prevent or contain transmission.","Anand, P.; Allen, H.; Ferrer, R.; Gold, N.; Gonzales Martinez, R.

318,Estimating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections: systematic review,"Abstract Background: Accurate seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations could help gauge the true magnitude and spread of the infection seroprevalence. Reported estimates have varied greatly, but many have derived from biased samples, and inadequate testing methods. Objective: To estimate the range of valid seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations, and compare these seroprevalence estimates with the cumulative cases seen in the same population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints from January 2020 to 25 May 2020 that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of either the general community or of defined sub-populations, such healthcare workers and other organizations. Results: Of the 837 studies identified, 49 were assessed and 14 were includable.

The seroprevalence proportions in 10 studies ranged between 1%-10%, and 2 study estimates under 1%, and 2 over 10% - from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt in Germany and from Northwest Iran. The two studies in healthcare workers, in Italy and Spain, had seroprevalence rates at higher range of estimates, with the Barcelona hospitals having a higher rate than the Spanish national survey. For only one study was the seroprevalence estimate higher than the cumulative incidence, though these were proximate for several studies. In five studies, the seroprevalence was similar to the cumulative case numbers in the same population. For seropositive cases not previously detected as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 mostly less than 10% with the level of infection lower in the general community, suggesting levels well below herd immunity. The similarity of seroprevalence and reported cases is several studies, and high symptom rates in seropositive cases suggest that gaps between seroprevalence rates and reported cases are likely due to undertesting of symptomatic people.","Byambasuren, O.; Dobler, C.

319,Connecting in COVID 19: Neurology tele-follow-up experience,"Introduction: The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic led to temporary closure of routine hospital services. This prompted the initiation of teleconsult follow-up in our department. The study outlines the experience of tele-follow-up at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, and the perspective of neurologists about this novel approach. Methods: The tele-follow-up was started from 26th March 2020. Data of follow up appointments was provided by the medical record section. The faculty and senior residents conducted the tele-follow-up. Communication was made via voice calls. The data for initial ten days was analyzed to find the utility and experience of the new service. Results: In the initial ten working days, data of 968 patients was provided for tele-follow-up. A successful communication was made in 50.3% patients (contact with patients: 27.7% and family members 22.6%). The phone numbers which were not contactable/invalid/not available constituted 36.8% of the data. A total of 35 faculty and residents conducted the tele-follow-up. The utility of tele-follow-up was perceived as good by 71.4% of neurologists. Majority of neurologists (71.4%) observed that [&ge;]90% of patients were continuing medications. Patients outside the city constituted 50-75% of the list. The survey revealed that all neurologists felt the need to continue tele-follow-up for far off stable patients post lock down and resumption of regular outpatient services. Conclusion: The survey established the feasibility and utility of teleconsult for follow up of patients with neurological diseases who were attending the regular outpatient services before the lock down.","Vibha, D.; Srivastava, M.

320,"The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier: Kinetics, distribution, mechanisms, and influence of ApoE genotype, sex, and inflammation","Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 {+/-} 0.024 L/g-min and 0.294 {+/-} 0.032 L/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood. ApoE isoform or sex did not affect whole brain uptake, but had variable effects on olfactory bulb, liver, spleen, and kidney uptakes. In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.

321,Comparative multiplexed interactomics of SARS-CoV-2 and homologous coronavirus non-structural proteins identifies unique and shared host-cell dependencies,"Human coronaviruses (hCoV) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 - an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed anti-viral therapeutics.","Davies, J. P.; Almasy, K. M.; McDonald, E.

322,An Antioxidant Enzyme Therapeutic for COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people worldwide, and there are currently no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines. We report herein a therapeutic based on catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species, which are excessively produced resulting from the infection and inflammatory process. Catalase assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity. Such a therapeutic can be readily manufactured at low cost as a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Qin, M.; Cao, Z.; Wen, J.; Yu, Q.; Liu, C.; Wang, F.; Yang, F.; Li, Y.; Fishbein, G.

323,Evidence of SARS-CoV2 entry protein ACE2 in the human nose and olfactory bulb,"Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptom. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human, post-mortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium.

Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia of via the olfactory pathway.","Klingenstein, M.; Klingenstein, S.; Neckel, P.

324,The Effect Of Famotidine On SARS-CoV-2 Proteases And Virus Replication,"The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Loffredo, M.; Lucero, H.; Chen, D.-Y.; O'Connell, A.; Bergqvist, S.; Munawar, A.; Bandara, A.; DeGraef, S.; Weeks, S.

325,Antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in response to immune pressure,"The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially driven by the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the virus.","Forni, D.; Cagliani, R.; Pontremoli, C.; Mozzi, A.; Pozzoli, U.; Clerici, M.; Sironi, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
326,Bioinformatic analysis of shared B and T cell epitopes amongst relevant coronaviruses to human health: Is there cross-protection?,"Within the last 30 years 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have evolved and adapted to cause disease and spread amongst the human population. From the three, SARS-CoV-2 has spread world-wide and to July 2020 it has been responsible for more than 11 million confirmed cases and over half a million deaths. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, social distancing has been the most effective measure to control the pandemic. However it has become evident that as the virus spreads the only tool that will allow us to fully control it is an effective vaccine. There are currently more than 150 vaccine candidates in different stages of development using a variety of viral antigens, with the S protein being the most targeted antigen. Although some new experimental evidence suggests cross-reacting responses between coronaviruses are present in the population, it remains unknown whether potential shared antigens between different coronaviruses could provide cross-protection. Given that coronaviruses are emerging pathogens and continue to represent a threat to global health, the development of a SARS-Cov-2 vaccine that could provide  universal protection against other coronaviruses should be pushed forward. Here we present a thorough review of reported B and T cell epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and other relevant coronaviruses, in addition we used web-based tools to predict novel B and T cell epitopes that have not been reported before. Analysis of experimental evidence that is constantly emerging complemented with the findings of this study allow us support the hypothesis that cross-reactive responses, particularly those coming from T cells, might play a key role in controlling infection by SARS-CoV-2. We hope that with the evidence presented in this manuscript we provide arguments to encourage the study of cross-reactive responses in order to elucidate their role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Finally we expect our findings will aid targeted analysis of antigen-specific immune responses and guide future vaccine design aiming to develop a cross reactive effective vaccine against respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.","Pacheco-Olvera, D.

327,Comprehensive analysis of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in different geographic regions of India: An endeavour to classify Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains on the basis of co-existing mutations,"Accumulation of mutations within the genome is the primary driving force for viral evolution within an endemic setting. This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility as well as antigenic shift to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we aimed at genome-wide analyses of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses for the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their spatial distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 441 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 21 being distinctive to India. Emergence of novel mutations were observed in S glycoprotein (7/33), NSP3 (6/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33) and N (2/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.4 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on the co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that representative strain of each group divided themselves into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. India was dominated by A2a clade (55.60%) followed by A3 (37.38%) and B (7%), but exhibited heterogeneous distribution among various geographical regions. The A2a clade mostly predominated in East India, Western India and Central India, whereas A3 clade prevailed in South and North India. In conclusion, this study highlights the divergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains and co-circulation of multiple clades in India. Monitoring of the emerging mutations would pave ways for vaccine formulation and designing of antiviral drugs.","Sarkar, R.; Mitra, S.; Chandra, P.; Saha, P.; Banerjee, A.; Dutta, S.; Chawla-Sarkar, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
328,Alignment-free machine learning approaches for the lethality prediction of potential novel human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide,"A newly emerging novel coronavirus appeared and rapidly spread worldwide and World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The roles and characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe on humans. The detection of the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide perspective for treatment. We developed alignment-free machine learning approaches for an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide. We performed extensive experiments through six different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms in combination with digital signal processing to infer the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses using previous existing strains. The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human coronaviruses. Our study achieves high levels of prediction performance based on raw RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge. The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this alignment-free machine learning-based approach can offer a reliable real-time estimation for its viral lethality.","YIN, R.; Luo, Z.; Kwoh, C.

329,Prophylactic and Therapeutic Inhibition of In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Oleandrin,"With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","Plante, K. S.; Plante, J.

As SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily due to airborne droplets, it is critical to verify the filtration efficiency of these alternate media based facemasks. While several media are being tested and used, commercially available dust cleaners have shown reasonable filtration efficiency. This may also be due to the potential electrostatic charge on the surface which enhances capture of the fine particles.

331,Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"Background and Purpose Reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology. Methods We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022). Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","Ayub, N.; Cohen, J.; Jing, J.; Jain, A.; Tesh, R.; Mukerji, S.

332,Women in power: Female leadership and public health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Some countries have been more successful than others at dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. When we explore the different policy approaches adopted as well as the underlying socio-economic factors, we note an interesting set of correlations: countries led by women leaders have fared significantly better than those led by men on a wide range of dimensions concerning the global health crisis. In this paper, we analyze available data for 35 countries, focusing on the following variables: number of deaths per capita due to COVID-19, number of days with reported deaths, peaks in daily deaths, deaths occurred on the first day of lockdown, and excess mortality. Results show that countries governed by female leaders experienced much fewer COVID-19 deaths per capita and were more effective and rapid at flattening the epidemic's curve, with lower peaks in daily deaths. We argue that there are both contingent and structural reasons that may explain these stark differences. First of all, most women-led governments were more prompt at introducing restrictive measures in the initial phase of the epidemic, prioritizing public health over economic concerns, and more successful at eliciting collaboration from the population. Secondly, most countries led by women are also those with a stronger focus on social equality, human needs and generosity. These societies are more receptive to political agendas that place social and environmental wellbeing at the core of national policymaking.","Coscieme, L.; Fioramonti, L.; Mortensen, L.

Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","Schmidt, N.; Lareau, C.

334,"Differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, and rates per million population in the first five months of the pandemic","Abstract Objective: To describe differences by country-level income in COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, incidence rates, and death rates per million population. Methods: Publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from December 31, 2019 to June 3, 2020 were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine associations of country-level income with COVID-19 cases, deaths, case-fatality rates, incidence rates, and death rates. Results: A total of 380,803 deaths out of 6,348,204 COVID-19 cases were reported from 210 countries and territories globally in the period under study, and the global case-fatality rate was 6.0%. Of the total globally reported cases and deaths, the percentages of cases and deaths were 59.9% and 75.0% for high-income countries, and 30.9% and 20.7% for upper-middle-income countries. Countries in higher-income categories had higher incidence rates and death rates. Between April and May, the incidence rates in higher-income groups of countries decreased, but in other groups, it increased. Conclusions In the first five months of the COVID-19 pandemic, most cases and deaths were reported from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and those countries had higher incidence rates and death rates per million population than did lower-middle and low-income countries.

335,"RT-PCR testing to detect a COVID-19 outbreak in Austria: rapid, accurate and early diagnosis in primary care (The REAP study)","Background Delay in COVID-19 detection has led to a major pandemic. We report rapid early detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people. Methods Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection. Findings All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness (OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or cough.

336,A Quantitative Lung Computed Tomography Image Feature for Multi-Center Severity Assessment of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions and congested healthcare systems globally. Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations ({kappa}-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%). Therefore, key highlights of this severity assessment feature are accuracy, lower dependency on expert availability, and wide utility across multiple imaging centers.","Ghosh, B.; Kumar, N.; Sadhu, A.

The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","Hussein, M.

338,Bivalent binding of a fully human IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins reveals mechanisms of potent neutralization,"In vitro antibody selection against pathogens from naive combinatorial libraries can yield various classes of antigen-specific binders that are distinct from those evolved from natural infection1-4. Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction5. Here we report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naive human Fab library. Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the ""up"" and the other in the ""down"" position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, B.; Asarnow, D.; Lee, W.-H.; Huang, C.-W.; Faust, B.; Ng, P. M. L.; Ngoh, E. Z.

Multi-strain sequence alignments of coronaviruses (CoV) provide important information for interpreting the genome and its variation. We apply a comparative genomics method, ConsHMM, to the multi-strain alignments of CoV to annotate every base of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with conservation states based on sequence alignment patterns among CoV. The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and the state annotations are more predictive than existing genomic annotations in prioritizing bases without non-singleton mutations, which are likely enriched for important genomic bases. We expect the conservation states to be a resource for interpreting the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mutations.","Kwon, S.

340,Syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells,"Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with extensive lung damage and the presence of infected multinucleated syncytial pneumocytes. The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.

341,SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells,"With more than 13 million cases and 570,000 deaths, and with the resulting social upheaval, the COVID-19 pandemic presents one of the greatest challenges ever to the scientific community. It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface and to drive fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes, thus allowing transfer of viral RNA to the cytosol. Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.","Bayati, A.; Kumar, R.; Francis, V.; McPherson, P.

342,The antibody response to the glycan α-Gal correlates with COVID-19 disease symptoms,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Urra, J.

343,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Depends on Cellular Heparan Sulfate and ACE2,"We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its Receptor Binding Domain. Docking studies suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.","Clausen, T. M.; Sandoval, D. R.; Spliid, C.

344,Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies depicts the evolution of mutation sites amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India,"With the exponential spread of COVID-19 pandemic across the world within the last six months, SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously trying to adapt themselves in their host environment by random mutations. While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential should get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation probability patterns are evolving in 864 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 30 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of four months. Out of these, the mutational probabilities of 25 variants including C14408T (in RdRp gene), A23403G (in spike gene), C6312A (nsp3 gene) are continuously increasing suggesting that these mutations are being propagated with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. In contrast, the mutational probabilities of five variants including C6312A (nsp3 gene), G11083T (nsp6 gene), C28311T (N gene) have significantly decreased in May-June as compared to March-April, suggesting these mutations are being terminated with time.

345,Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycan-assisted endocytosis as a COVID-19 therapeutic option,"Drugs capable of blocking the infectious cycle of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to tackle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the viral Spike (S) protein to human ACE2, has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target. Here we use murine leukemia viruses pseudotyped with Spike from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated coronavirus entry can be mitigated by heparin, a heparan sulfate-related glycan, or by genetic ablation of biosynthetic enzymes for the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A drug repurposing screen targeting HSPG-dependent endocytosis identifies pharmacologically active endocytosis inhibitors that also abrogate coronavirus cell entry. Among them, Mitoxantrone (EC50=~10 nM) targets HSPGs directly, whereas Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to impair HSPG-assisted viral entry. Gene expression profiling suggests potential combination regimens that optimally target HSPG-dependent viral entry. Altogether, our study establishes HSPGs as an assisting factor for ACE2 in endocytosis-mediated coronavirus entry and identifies drugs that can be repurposed to target this important stage in the viral life cycle.","Zhang, Q.; Chen, C.; Swaroop, M.; Xu, M.; Wang, L.; Lee, J.; Pradhan, M.; Shen, M.; Luo, Z.; Xu, Y.; Huang, W.; Zheng, W.; Ye, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,False

Method: After developing a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model with COCOA and voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG), we assumed that COCOA can reduce infectiousness by 10-50% points through self-quarantine at home after receiving notification from COCOA. Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one.

347,Impact of COVID-19 on 2020 US life expectancy for the Black and Latino populations,"The Black and Latino populations have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and risk of death for those infected. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, as of July 4, 2020, deaths to Black and Latino individuals comprised 23% and 17%, respectively, of the approximately 115,000 COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 mortality is likely to result in a larger decline in life expectancy during 2020 than the US has experienced for decades as well as a particularly large reduction for Black and Latino individuals. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 for 2020, by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths-one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our most likely estimate indicates a reduction in life expectancy at birth greater than 1.5 years for both the Black and Latino populations, which is one year larger than the reduction for whites. This would imply that the Black-white gap would increase by 30%, from 3.6 to 4.7 years, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2008 and reversing an overall trend of steeper mortality declines among the Black population since the early 1990s.

Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood and easily usable by the general population are needed in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO RDT and the results have been submitted for publication and are currently under review. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by common folk in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use Methods 142 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plants workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use with or without a tutorial video was made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users ability to read the results. Results 88.4 % of the test users judged the instruction for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3 % of the users obtained a valid results and according to the supervisors 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the user. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback toward the COVID PRESTO as a potential self-test. No influence of age and education was observed. Conclusion COVID-PRESTO was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its utilization was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing a promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This RDT can become an easy-to-use tool to help know whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the perspective of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.","prazuck, t.; Phan Van, J.; sinturel, F.; levray, f.; Elie, A.; Camera, D.; Pialloux, g.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152660v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152660v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
349,Complexity signatures in the COVID-19 epidemic: power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves,"We apply a versatile growth model, whose rate of change is given by a generalised beta distribution, to describe the complex behaviour of the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries in Europe and Asia. We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the death toll but also the risk of resurgence.","Vasconcelos, G. L.; Macedo, A. M.

350,Public Opinions towards COVID-19 in California and New York on Twitter,"Background: With the pandemic of COVID-19 and the release of related policies, discussions about the COVID-19 are widespread online. Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with ""protective measures"" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states. Conclusions: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences.","Wang, X.; Zou, C.; Xie, Z.; Li, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151936v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151936v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
351,"The natural history of symptomatic COVID-19 in Catalonia, Spain: a multi-state model including 109,367 outpatient diagnoses, 18,019 hospitalisations, and 5,585 COVID-19 deaths among 5,627,520 people","Background The natural history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has yet to be fully described, with most previous reports focusing on hospitalised patients. Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and/or related mortality. Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","Burn, E.; Tebe, C.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Recalde, M.; Roel, E.; Prats-Uribe, A.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Duarte-Salles, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

We developed a surrogate neutralization test (sVNT) to assess at what degree serum antibodies interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD to ACE2. The sVNT revealed neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies in the sera of 90% of mildly and 100% of severely affected coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients. Importantly, sVNT results correlated strongly to the results from pseudotyped-vesicular stomatitis virus-vector-based neutralization assay and to levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies. Moreover, levels of neutralizing antibodies also correlated to duration and severity of clinical symptoms, but not patient age or gender. These findings together with the sVNT will not only be important for evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in a population but also for identifying promising plasma donors for successful passive antibody therapy.","Bosnjak, B.; Stein, S.

We reveal two regions that rich of linear epitopes, i.e., CTD and a region close to the S2' cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find RBD is lack of linear epitope. Besides 3 moderate immunogenic peptides from RBD, 16 highly immunogenic peptides from other regions of Spike protein are determined.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate. Results: The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness. Conclusions: High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.","Sun, S.; Lin, D.; Operario, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

We therefore investigated the effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that selective statins reduced SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and inhibited high and low pathogenic coronavirus infection in human cells. A retrospective study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 implies that reduced high density lipoprotein levels, which are typically counteracted by statin therapy, are associated with aggravated disease outcome. These results suggest that statin therapy poses no additional risk to individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and that some statins may have a mild beneficial effect on COVID-19 outcome.","Moeller, R.; Zapatero-Belinchon, F.

356,COVID-19 scenarios for the United States,"The United States (US) has not been spared in the ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease. COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.","IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team,; Hay, S.

357,Development of a severity of disease score and classification model by machine learning for hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression.

In Spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite lacking evidence-based guidance. Objective: To describe clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, including cost implications, immediately following testing availability. Design: Retrospective chart review of patients who received antibody testing from May 14, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Setting: A large academic medical center, one of the first in the US to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians. Patients: 447 consecutive patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Measurements: Clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, cost implications, and comparison with current expert-based guidance from the IDSA and CDC. Results: Of 444 individual antibody test results meeting inclusion criteria, the two most commonly described indications for ordering the antibody test, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n=223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19 compatible illness (n=105) with no previous molecular testing and in asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure or contact with a person with COVID-19 compatible illness (n=60). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (p<0.0001) among those indications inconsistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance. Total cost estimates ranged from $57,720 to $97,680, of which 42% was for testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance. Limitations: The duration of antibody response following infection is unclear and asymptomatic individuals may not develop a positive antibody response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these two groups. Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs.","Wiencek, J. R.; Head, C. L.; Sifri, C.

To reveal the missing information, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang of China. Design Cross-sectional study Setting Three blood centers, located in the central, south and north China, respectively, recruiting from January to April 2020. Participants 38,144 healthy blood donors donated in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang were enrolled, who were all met the criteria for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Main outcome measures Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including total antibody (TAb), IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (IgG-RBD) and nucleoprotein (IgG-N), and IgM. Pseudotype lentivirus-based neutralization test was performed on all TAb-positive samples. In addition, anonymous personal demographic information, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation and educational level, and blood type were collected. Results A total of 519 samples from 410 donors were confirmed by neutralization tests. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors was 2.29% (407/17,794, 95%CI: 2.08% to 2.52%) in Wuhan, 0.029% (2/6,810, 95%CI: 0.0081% to 0.11%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0074% (1/13,540, 95%CI: 0.0013% to 0.042%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. The earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in blood donors was identified on January 20, 2020 in Wuhan. The weekly prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Wuhan's blood donors changed dynamically and were 0.08% (95%CI: 0.02% to 0.28%) during January 15 to 22 (before city lockdown), 3.08% (95%CI: 2.67% to 3.55%) during January 23 to April 7 (city quarantine period) and 2.33% (95%CI: 2.06% to 2.63%) during April 8 to 30 (after lockdown easing). Female and older-age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among donors in Wuhan. Conclusions The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China was low, even in Wuhan city. According to our data, the earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan's donors should not earlier than January, 2020.

361,Identification of Vulnerable Populations and Areas at Higher Risk of COVID-19 Related Mortality in the U.S.,"Background The role of health-related disparities including sociodemographic, environmental, and critical care capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly understood. In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.","Correa-Agudelo, E.; Mersha, T.; Hernandez, A.; Branscum, A.

Methods We studied the association between prehospitalization PPI use and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results In our study, 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPI. Mortality among PPI-users was 2.3 times higher than non-users, along with 2.5 times higher risk of mechanical ventilation. This relationship existed even after adjusting for confounding variables. Discussion These results warrant further investigation to evaluate if PPI-induced hypochlorhydria is associated with a higher risk of GI symptoms and worse outcomes because of the omnipresence of ACE-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.","Ramachandran, P.; Perisetti, A.; Gajendran, M.; Jean-Louise, F.; Dwivedi, A.

363,Efficacy of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background The antimalarial agents, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) show promising SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral activity in vitro; however, clinical studies have reported conflicting results. We sought to systematically evaluate the effect of CQ and HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZ) on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published through July 7, 2020. We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, preprints and grey literature. We included studies that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without AZ. We pooled only adjusted effect estimates of mortality using a random effect model and estimated between studies heterogeneity using I2 statistic. We summarized the effect of CQ or HCQ on viral clearance and ICU admission/ mechanical ventilation. Results Out of 1463 citations screened for eligibility, five RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included (20,263 patients, all hospitalized but with a variable disease severity spectrum). Thirteen studies (1 RCT and 12 cohorts) with 19,573 patients examined the effect of HCQ on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted OR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.96-1.15, I2=0 %, p=0.647). Six cohort studies examined the effect of HCQ and AZ combination among 3430 patients. After excluding a study that examined only patients with cancers, the pooled adjusted OR was (1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.34, I2=0.0%). Two cohort studies and three RCTs found no significant effect of HCQ on viral clearance. One RCT with 48 patients demonstrated improved viral clearance in patients treated with CQ and HCQ. Three cohort studies found that HCQ with or without AZ had no significant effect on mechanical ventilation/ ICU admission. Conclusion Moderate certainty evidence suggests that HCQ, with or without AZ, lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings are consistent with the recommendations from medical societies that HCQ should only be used to treat COVID-19 patients in the context of clinical trials. Trials of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis are ongoing.","Kashour, Z. T.; Riaz, M.; garbati, M.; Aldosary, O.; Tlayjeh, H.; Gerber, D.; Murad, M. H.; Sohail, M. R.; Kashour, T.; Tleyjeh, I.

364,"Outbreak of COVID-19 and Interventions in One of the Largest Jails in the United States: Cook County, IL, 2020","Background: Correctional and detention facilities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to shared space, contact between staff and detained persons, and movement within facilities of detained persons, many with pre-existing medical conditions. On March 18, 2020, Cook County Jail, one of the United States' largest, identified its first suspected case of COVID-19 in a detained person. Methods: This analysis includes SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by molecular detection among detained persons and Cook County Sheriff's Office staff. We examined occurrence of symptomatic cases in each building and proportions of asymptomatic detained persons testing positive. We describe timing of interventions including social distancing, mask use, and expanded testing and show outbreak trajectory in the jail versus contemporaneous case counts in Chicago. Results: During March 1-April 30, 907 symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected among detained persons (n = 628) and staff (n = 279), with nine deaths. Symptomatic cases occurred in all housing divisions; in 9/13 buildings, staff cases occurred first. Among asymptomatic detained persons in quarantine, 23.6% tested positive. Programmatic activity and visitation stopped March 9, cells were converted into single occupancy beginning March 26, and universal masking was implemented for staff (April 2) and detained persons (April 13). Cases at the jail declined while cases in Chicago increased. Conclusion: Aggressive intervention strategies coupled with widespread diagnostic testing of detained and staff populations can limit introduction and mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in correctional and detention facilities.","Zawitz, C.; Welbel, S.; Ghinai, I.; Mennella, C.; Levin, R.; Samala, U.; Bryant Smith, M.; Gubser, J.; Jones, B.; Varela, K.; Kirbiyik, U.; Rafinski, J.; Fitzgerald, A.; Orris, P.; Bahls, A.; Black, S.

365,The Efficacy of IL-6 Inhibitor Tocilizumab in Reducing Severe COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review,"Without proven, targeted therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19, potentially utilizing existing drugs. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, also called a cytokine storm. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine which drives the cytokine storm and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. 9 case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for a qualitative synthesis. In all of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC and a combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.482 (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.326-0.713). Additionally, 12 uncontrolled trials were identified for a qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 13.6%. Results from the systematic analysis provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ, validating the merit and need for ongoing clinical trials of the drug to treat severe COVID-19.","Kaye, A.

366,Low-Dose Whole-Lung Radiation for COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: Safety of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19 pneumonia has been established in two phase I trials. By focally dampening pulmonary cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve outcomes in hospitalized and oxygen-dependent COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or at least until hospital discharge, and compared to an age- and comorbidity-matched control cohort. COVID-19-positive patients eligible for this protocol were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, and serologic responses. Results: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared to ten matched control patients, of whom six received COVID-directed therapy. Median time to clinical recovery was 12 days for the control cohort vs 3 days for LD-RT (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 and 12 days, p=0.19), and intubation rates (40% and 10%, p=0.12) were shorter for the LD-RT cohort. The LD-RT cohort had faster radiographic improvement (p=0.03), even among patients with high COVID burden. Serologic recovery in specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, and inflammatory markers occurred more rapidly following LD-RT than among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including a 3-fold risk reduction in time to clinical improvement, were observed following LD-RT compared to matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the global availability of radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts to investigate the optimal role of LD-RT in COVID-19 pneumonia are justified.

368,The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) systematically underestimates the risk of in-hospital mortality in unplanned COVID-19 admissions to hospital.,"Background: Although the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its latest version NEWS2 are recommended for monitoring for deterioration in patients admitted to hospital, little is known about their performance in COVID-19 patients. We analysed the performance of National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

369,Development of a data-driven COVID-19 prognostication tool to inform triage and step-down care for hospitalised patients in Hong Kong: A population based cohort study,"Abstract Background: This is the first study on prognostication in an entire cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the city of Hong Kong. Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. Methods: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1,037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. Results: The 1,037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD {+/-} 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro- and micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%-91.3% and 96.0%-95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%-94.2% and 97.8%-97.1% under Day-5 model. as compared to 94.2%, 95.0%-97.1% and 98.3%-98.6% under Day-5 model. Conclusions: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome.

370,Municipality- level predictors of COVID-19 mortality in Mexico: a cautionary tale,"Background. Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico. Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported. Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000). Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions.

We jointly modelled the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We used changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nationally, we estimated 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the population had been infected by 1st June 2020, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

372,"Quantification of the South African Lockdown Regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, and the Levels of Immunity They Require to Work","This research quantifies the various South African lockdown regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in terms of the basic reproduction number, r0. It further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work, then predicts their perceived values, should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","Childs, S.

373,Pericarditis and myocarditis long after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a cross-sectional descriptive study in health-care workers,"Background: Cardiac sequelae of past SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly documented. We conducted a cross-sectional study in health-care workers to report evidence of pericarditis and myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We studied 139 health-care workers with confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection (103 diagnosed by RT-PCR and 36 by serology). Participants underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, laboratory tests including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Pericarditis was diagnosed when classical criteria were present, and the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on the updated CMR Lake-Louise-Criteria. Results: Median age was 52 years (IQR 41-57), 100 (72%) were women, and 23 (16%) were previously hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. At examination (10.4 [9.3-11.0] weeks after infection-like symptoms), all participants presented hemodynamic stability. Chest pain, dyspnoea or palpitations were observed in 58 (42%) participants; electrocardiographic abnormalities in 69 (50%); NT-pro-BNP was elevated in 11 (8%); troponin in 1 (1%); and CMR abnormalities in 104 (75%). Isolated pericarditis was diagnosed in 4 (3%) participants, myopericarditis in 15 (11%) and isolated myocarditis in 36 (26%). Participants diagnosed by RT-PCR were more likely to still present symptoms than participants diagnosed by serology (73 [71%] vs 18 [50%]; p=0.027); nonetheless, the prevalence of pericarditis or myocarditis was high in both groups (44 [43%] vs 11 [31%]; p=0.238). Most participants (101 [73%]) showed altered immune cell counts in blood, particularly decreased eosinophil (37 [27%]; p<0.001) and increased CD4-CD8-/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (24 [17%]; p<0.001). Pericarditis was associated with elevated CD4-CD8-/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (p=0.011), while participants diagnosed with myopericarditis or myocarditis had lower (p<0.05) plasmacytoid dendritic cell, NK-cell and plasma cell counts and lower anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels (p=0.027). Conclusions: Pericarditis and myocarditis with clinical stability are frequent long after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in presently asymptomatic subjects. These observations will probably apply to the general population infected and may indicate that cardiac sequelae might occur late in association with an altered (delayed) innate and adaptative immune response.","Eiros, R.; Barreiro-Perez, M.; Martin-Garcia, A.; Almeida, J.; Villacorta, E.; Perez-Pons, A.; Merchan, S.; Torres-Valle, A.; Sanchez-Pablo, C.; Gonzalez-Calle, D.; Perez-Escurza, O.; Toranzo, I.; Diaz-Pelaez, E.; Fuentes-Herrero, B.; Macias-Alvarez, L.; Oliva-Ariza, G.; Lecrevisse, Q.; Fluxa, R.; Bravo-Grandez, J.

374,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 are distinct in children with MIS-C compared to adults with COVID-19,"Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.","Weisberg, S.

376,Multidisciplinary approach to COVID-19 risk communication: A framework and tool for individual and regional risk assessment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded over ten million cases globallywith no vaccine available yet. Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from anywhere.","Parajuli, R.

377,Knowledge and Behaviors towards COVID-19 among University of Aleppo Students: An Online Cross-sectional Survey,"Abstract Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infection caused by a novel coronavirus that affects respiratory tract. People's awareness and knowledge of, and behavior and attitude toward COVID-19 are scarcely investigated , making medical literature related to this point poor. we aim to measure the knowledge of, and the reaction to COVID-19 among University of Aleppo students in Syria, and the determinants of their awareness and behavior regarding this disease. Materials and Methods: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, that was conducted from 21st March to 30 March 2020. We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics ,knowledge and behaviours . Every participant's knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people -which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases. Conclusion: Junior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses. Finally, we should be aware of the negative impact of quarantine on public health to take it into consideration for current campaigns and future policies.","alhamid, a. m.; Alhamid, A.

378,"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Policy on Homicide, Suicide, and Motor Vehicle Deaths in Peru","Introduction: Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, R.

379,Placental SARS-CoV-2 in a patient with mild COVID-19 disease,"Background: The full impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy remains uncharacterized. Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality,1 and COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women.2 We present a case of placental SARS-CoV-2 virus in a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy and mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A pregnant woman was evaluated at University of Missouri Women and Childrens Hospital. Institutional review board approval was obtained; information was obtained from medical records. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. A gynecological pathologist examined the placenta and performed histolopathology. Sections were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; slides were cut and subjected to hematoxylin-and-eosin or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. IHC was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. Findings: A 29 year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias two days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her parents were in self-isolation for COVID-19 positivity; husband was asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19, but exposed to a workplace (meatpacking facility) outbreak. Prenatal course was uncomplicated, with no gestational hypertension. She was afebrile and asymptomatic with normal vital signs throughout hospitalization. Her myalgias improved prior to admission. A liveborn male infant was delivered vaginally. Newborn course was uneventful; he was appropriate for gestational age, physical was unremarkable, and he was discharged home at 36 hours. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative at 24 hours. At one-week follow-up, newborn was breastfeeding well, with no fevers or respiratory distress. Overall placental histology is consistent with acute uterine hypoxia (subchorionic laminar necrosis) superimposed on chronic uterine hypoxia (extra-villous trophoblasts and focal chronic villitis). IHC using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens throughout the placenta in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and rarely in CK7-expressing trophoblasts. Negative control placenta (November 2019 delivery) and ferret nasal turbinate tissues (not shown) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: In this report, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the placenta, but newborn was COVID-19 negative. Our case shows maternal vascular malperfusion, with no features of fetal vascular malperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental COVID-19 despite mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy (with no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); specifically, this patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her having mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for possible placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and other pregnancy complications) as well as for potential vertical transmission -- especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed, to determine whether women with mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic COVID-19 may have SARS-CoV-2 virus that can cross the placenta, cause fetal vascular malperfusion, and possibly affect the fetus. This raises important public health and public policy questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing on a regular basis throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, A.

380,Quantifying Respiratory Airborne Particle Dispersion Control Through Improvised Reusable Masks,"Objective: To determine the effectiveness of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings in controlling airborne dispersion from exhalation (both droplet and aerosol), and to aid in establishing public health strategies on the wearing of masks to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Design: This comparative effectiveness study using an exhalation simulator to conduct 94 experiment runs with combinations of 8 different fabrics, 5 mask designs, and airflows for both talking and coughing. Setting: Non-airtight fume hood and multiple laser scattering particle sensors. Participants: No human participants. Exposure: 10% NaCl nebulized solution delivered by an exhalation simulator through various masks and fabrics with exhalation airflows representative of ""coughing"" and ""talking or singing."" Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was reduction in aerosol dispersion velocity, quantity of particles, and change in dispersion direction. Measurements used in this study included peak expiratory flow (PEF), aerosol velocity, concentration area under curve (AUC), and two novel metrics of expiratory flow dispersion factor (EDF) and filtration efficiency indicator (FEI). Results: Three-way multivariate analysis of variance establishes that factors of fabric, mask design, and exhalation breath level have a statistically significant effect on changing direction, reducing velocity or concentration (Fabric: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Mask design: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Breath level: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .004). There were also statistically significant interaction effects between combinations of all primary factors. Conclusions and Relevance: The application of facial coverings or masks can significantly reduce the airborne dispersion of aerosolized particles from exhalation. The results show that wearing of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings can help increase the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) especially where infectious contaminants may exist in shared air spaces. However, the effectiveness varies greatly between the specific fabrics and mask designs used.","Edwards, N.

381,"Stress, burnout and depression in women in health care during COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Scoping Review","ABSTRACT Objectives The overall objectives of this rapid scoping review are to (a) synthesize the common triggers of stress, burnout, and depression faced by women in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) identify individual-, organizational-, and systems-level interventions that can support the well-being of women HCWs during a pandemic. Design This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from 2003 until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.

382,Discrete simulation analysis of COVID-19 and prediction of isolation bed numbers,"Background. The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods. We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the reasonable number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. Results. Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease cure time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P * (-0.273 + 0.009I +0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) * (1+V).","Li, X.; Cai, Y.; Ding, Y.; Li, J.-d.; Huang, G.; Liang, Y.; Xu, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152330v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152330v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
383,The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19,"Background: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. Methods: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. Findings: With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). Interpretation: While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.","Russell, T.

384,Predictive performance of international COVID-19 mortality forecasting models,"Forecasting models have provided timely and critical information about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, predicting both the timing of peak mortality, and the total magnitude of mortality, which can guide health system response and resource allocation. Out-of-sample predictive validation--checking how well past versions of forecasting models predict subsequently observed trends--provides insight into future model performance. As data and models are updated regularly, a publicly available, transparent, and reproducible framework is needed to evaluate them in an ongoing manner. We reviewed 384 published and unpublished COVID-19 forecasting models, and evaluated seven models for which publicly available, multi-country, and date-versioned mortality estimates could be downloaded. These included those modeled by: DELPHI-MIT (Delphi), Youyang Gu (YYG), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Imperial College London (Imperial), and three models produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a curve fit model (IHME-CF), a hybrid curve fit and epidemiological compartment model (IHME-CF SEIR), and a hybrid mortality spline and epidemiological compartment model (IHME-MS SEIR). Collectively models covered 169 countries, as well as the 50 states of the United States, and Washington, D.C., and accounted for >99% of all reported COVID-19 deaths on July 20th, 2020. As expected, errors in mortality predictions increased with a larger number of weeks of extrapolation. For the most recent models, released in June, at six weeks of forecasting the best performing model was the IHME-MS SEIR model, with a cumulative MAPE of 10.2%, followed by YYG (11.3%) and LANL (12.6%). Looking across models, errors in cumulative mortality predictions were highest in sub-Saharan Africa and lowest in high-income countries, reflecting differences in data availability and prediction difficulty in earlier vs. later stages of the epidemic. For peak timing prediction, among models released in April, median absolute error values at six weeks ranged from 20 days for the Imperial model to 35 days for the YYG model. In sum, we provide a publicly available dataset and evaluation framework for assessing the predictive validity of COVID-19 mortality forecasts. We find substantial variation in predictive performance between models, and note large differences in average predictive validity between regions, highlighting priority areas for further study in sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging-epidemic contexts.","Friedman, J.; Liu, P.; Gakidou, E.; IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151233v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151233v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
385,Modelling suggests blood group incompatibility may substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Several independent datasets suggest blood type A is over-represented and type O under-represented among COVID-19 patients. Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient. Comparison of model outputs to published data on COVID-19 prevalence indicates that if this scenario holds true, ABO incompatibility may reduce virus transmissibility by 60% or more. Paradoxically, however, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A or ""super-spreader"" type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity amongst the remaining susceptible individuals. I stress that these results illustrate a theoretical model of ABO blood group interaction with virus transmission and require confirmation by observation.","Ellis, P.

However, most studies thus far are based on hospitalized patients and lack longitudinal follow up. As the majority of COVID-19 cases are not hospitalized, prospective studies of symptoms in the population presenting to primary care are needed. Objective: To assess the longitudinal dynamic of clinical symptoms in non-hospitalized individuals prior to and throughout the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: From 1/3/2020 to 07/06/2020, information on symptoms from either surveys or primary care visits was available for 206,377 individuals, including 2,471 who tested positive for COVID-19. Data were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) of the second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel, consisting of both results of PCR tests and symptoms recorded by primary care physicians, and linked longitudinal self reported symptoms. Exposures: Diagnosis of COVID-19 disease was made by PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Longitudinal prevalence of clinical symptoms Results: In adults, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in EHR were cough (11.6%), fever (10.3%), and myalgia (7.7%) and the most prevalent self-reported symptoms were cough (21%), fatigue (19%) and rhinorrhea and/or nasal congestion (17%). In children, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in the EHR were fever (7%), cough (5.5%) and abdominal pain (2.4%). Emotional disturbances were documented in 15.9% of the positive adults and 4.2% of the children. Loss of taste and smell, either self-reported or documented by a physician, 3 weeks prior to testing, were the most discriminative symptoms in adults (OR =11.18 and OR=5.47 respectively). Additional symptoms included self reported confusion (OR =4.02), and fatigue (OR = 1.73) and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea (OR = 2.09 for both ) and fever (OR= 1.62 ) by a physician. Mean time to recovery was 23.5 +- 9.9 days. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration (21.7 +- 8.8 days, p-value=0.01). Several symptoms, including fatigue, myalgia, runny nose and shortness of breath were reported weeks after recovery.

388,Assessing required SARS-CoV-2 blanket testing rates for possible control of the outbreak in the epicentre Lusaka province of Zambia with consideration for asymptomatic individuals: a simple mathematical modelling study.,"Abstract. Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [&ge;] 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [&ge;] 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [&ge;] 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

390,"Tobacco, but not nicotine and flavor-less electronic cigarettes, induces ACE2 and immune dysregulation","COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions worldwide. This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig/smoking.","Lee, A. C.; Chakladar, J.; Li, W.

391,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG from severely ill COVID-19 patients promotes macrophage hyper-inflammatory responses,"For yet unknown reasons, severely ill COVID-19 patients often become critically ill around the time of activation of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail. Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk.

The viral fusion spike (S) protein ectodomain is the primary target for vaccine development. Here we report an unexpected cold sensitivity of a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain construct currently being widely used for immunogen design. We found that when stored at 22 or 37 {degrees}C for 1 week, the S-protein displayed well-ordered trimeric spikes by negative stain electron microscopy. However, storage at 4 {degrees}C reduced the trimeric spikes to <10%, accompanied by decreased stability and enhanced exposure of the ACE-2 receptor binding site. Well-formed S particles could be recovered from cold-stored samples by a brief incubation at 37 {degrees}C. Our results will have broad impact on structural, functional and vaccine studies using the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain.

393,PT150 is a modulator of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.,"PT150 is a clinical stage molecule, taken orally, with a strong safety profile having completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for its original use as an anti-depressant. It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 M. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Theise, N.

394,Identifying Key Determinants of SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 Tight Interaction,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","Ngo, V.

395,Single-cell analysis reveals the function of lung progenitor cells in COVID-19 patients,"The high mortality of severe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barriers, pulmonary edema and consequently inflammatory tissue damage. Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1. Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration. Altogether this work uncovered the mechanism that how various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent and replenish alveoli loss post severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zuo, W.; Zhao, Z.; Zhao, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, X.; Zhang, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200188v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200188v1?rss=1,2020-07-13,2020-07-13,,False
396,Comparisons of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and those of other betacoronaviruses,"The genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is most closely related to viral metagenomes isolated from bats and, more distantly, pangolins. All are of sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. We have unravelled their recombinational and mutational histories. All showed clear evidence of recombination, most events involving the 3 half of the genomes. The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.","Rodriguez-Roman, E.; Gibbs, A.

This marks a unique opportunity to study how a virus spreads and evolves in a worldwide context. However, currently there is not a useful haplotype classification system to help tracking the virus evolution. Here we identified eleven mutations with 10 % or more frequency in a data set of 7848 genomes. Using these mutations, we identified 6 SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes or OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit) that correlate well with a phylogenomic tree. After that, we analyzed the geographical and temporal distribution of these OTUs, as well as their correlation with patient status. Our geographical analysis showed different OTUs prevalence between continents and the temporal distribution analysis revealed an evolution-like pattern in SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we observed a homogenous distribution of OTUs in mild and severe patients and a great prevalence of OTU 2 in asymptomatic patients. However, genomes in the asymptomatic category, comes from isolates on three consecutive days in February (15 to 17), weakening this observation and highlighting the need to increase genomic analyzes in asymptomatic and severe patients. Our classification system is phylogenetically consistent and allows us to easily track geographic and temporal distribution of important mutations around the world.

Here we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional landscape. These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus. RNA-Seq profiling implicated the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the underlying mechanism of inhibition and suggested that targeting this aspect of host biology may significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.","Hoagland, D.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.",Cindy Hoerner; Christoph Schuermann; Arne Auste; Aileen Ebenig; Samada Muraleedharan; Maike Herrmann; Barbara Schnierle; Michael D Muehlebach,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,False

SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2.

In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically  controlled fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by  orderly phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity.

408,Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector protects against SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of human infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Accordingly, an effective vaccine is of critical importance in mitigating coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) and curtailing the pandemic. We developed a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine by introducing a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene in place of the native glycoprotein gene (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2). Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung indicating protection against pneumonia. Finally, passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals protects naive mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These data support development of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 as an attenuated, replication-competent vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",James Brett Case; Paul Rothlauf; Rita E. Chen; Natasha Kafai; Julie M.

409,Genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat: Underlying role of variants in disease epidemiology,"Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.

Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis.

410,A drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis C antivirals as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be [~]2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of [~]6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found [~]50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 [&le;] 50 M. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M), Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.",Jeremy D Baker; Rikki L Uhrich; Gerald C Kraemer; Jason E Love; Brian C Kraemer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False

Characterising the pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hACs limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry.

412,Molecular analysis of binding region of an ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 between humans and mammals,"In June 2020, a second wave of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infections raised concern in Beijing, where salmon sold a fresh fish wholesale market was suspected of being the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. It has raised questions in the press and elsewhere about the scientific basis of salmon as a source of infection. With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed. However, a non-high structural homology of ACE2 between salmon and humans was observed.

413,"Inactivation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by specimen transport media, nucleic acid extraction reagents, detergents and fixatives","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid multi-faceted response by the scientific community, bringing researchers, health officials and industry together to address the ongoing public health emergency. To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment.

414,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of human ACE2 transgenic mice causes severe inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and compromised respiratory function","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has spread worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.",Emma S Winkler; Adam L Bailey; Natasha M Kafai; Sharmila Nair; Broc T McCune; Jinsheng Yu; Julie M Fox; Rita E Chen; James T Earnest; Shamus P Keeler; Jon H Ritter; Liang-I Kang; Sarah Dort; Annette Robichaud; Richard Head; Michael J Holtzman; Michael S Diamond,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False

Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was  exhausted or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the non-exhausted subsets from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-{kappa}B signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects displayed polyfunctional features.

416,Comprehensive in-vivo secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals novel regulatory motifs and mechanisms,"SARS-CoV-2 is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes COVID-19, a disease that has triggered a major human health and economic crisis. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis.

417,Discovery of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection using a phenotypic screening strategy and network-analysis to predict their potential to treat covid-19,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain.

However, lung concentration (6.7 {micro}g/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity.

Here we report the 3.5-[A] cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer. Unlike VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 binding by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their ""up"" and ""down"" positions. BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape.

To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitch platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types.

423,Human B cell clonal expansion and convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,"During virus infection B cells are critical for the production of antibodies and protective immunity. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped naive responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19 patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the presence of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-binding domain. These findings offer molecular insights into shared features of human B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic spillover coronaviruses.",Sandra C. A. Nielsen; Fan Yang; Katherine J. L.

424,Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and fatal respiratory disease,"ABSTRACTThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created an international health crisis. Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Joseph W.

425,A single-dose live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidate,"The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines to quench the unrestrained spread of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising vaccine platforms, developed in recent years, are leveraged for a rapid emergency response to COVID-191. We employed the live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as a vector to express the prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. In mice, the vaccine candidate, tentatively named YF-S0, induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and a favorable Th1 cell-mediated immune response. In a stringent hamster SARS-CoV-2 challenge model2, vaccine candidate YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals even within 10 days.

426,Screening and testing for a suitable untransfected cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies,"At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.

Author summaryIn the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.",Claudia Pommerenke; Ulfert Rand; Cord C.

427,Dual nature of human ACE2 glycosylation in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike,"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.",Ahmad Reza Mehdipour; Gerhard Hummer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,False
428,Molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 9-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The in situ architecture of the ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. These characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to an unprecedented resolution, and shed lights on how the virus packs its ~30 Kb long single-segmented RNA in the ~80 nm diameter lumen. Overall, the results unveiled the molecular architecture and assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 in native context.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Hangping Yao; Yutong Song; Yong Chen; Nanping Wu; Jialu Xu; Chujie Sun; Jiaxing Zhang; Tianhao Weng; Zheyuan Zhang; Zhigang Wu; Linfang Cheng; Danrong Shi; Xiangyun Lu; Jianlin Lei; Max Crispin; Yigong Shi; Lanjuan Li; Sai Li,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.192104v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.192104v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,False
429,Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases,"BackgroundLittle is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases.

Methods and findingsWe explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative.

430,Decline of humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals,"In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of [&ge;]1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.",Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussières; Annemarie Laumaea; Sai Priya Anand; Jérémie Prévost; Romain Gasser; Guillaume Goyette; Halima Medjahed; Josée Perreault; Tony Tremblay; Antoine Lewin; Laurie Gokool; Chantal Morrisseau; Philippe Bégin; Cécile Tremblay; Valérie Martel-Laferrière; Daniel E.

431,"Comprehensive variant and haplotype landscapes of 50,500 global SARS-CoV-2 isolates and accelerating accumulation of country-private variant profiles","Understanding the genetic etiology of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive understanding of the variant and haplotype landscape of all reported genomes of SARS-COV-2, the causative virus of the disease. Country-, state/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently.

Evidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May.

In summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.",Lishuang Shen; Jennifer Dien Bard; Jaclyn A.

432,Towards the design of multiepitope-based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis.

433,Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations,"AimThe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.

MethodsAn extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with {+/-}1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/).

ResultsA total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction.

434,Continuous flexibility analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike prefusion structures,"With the help of novel processing workflows and algorithms, we have obtained a better understanding of the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion state. We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Roberto Melero; Carlos Oscar S.

The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies.

436,In vivo structural characterization of the whole SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome identifies host cell target proteins vulnerable to re-purposed drugs,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells.

438,Enhanced COVID-19 data for improved prediction of survival,"The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the rapid world-wide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is having severe consequences for human health and the world economy. The virus effects individuals quite differently, with many infected patients showing only mild symptoms, and others showing critical illness. To lessen the impact of the pandemic, one important question is which factors predict the death of a patient? Here, we construct an enhanced COVID-19 dataset by processing two existing databases (from Kaggle and WHO) and using natural language processing methods to enhance the data by adding local weather conditions and research sentiment.Author summary In this study, we contribute an enhanced COVID-19 dataset, which contains 183 samples and 43 features. Application of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on the enhanced dataset achieves 95% accuracy in predicting patients survival, with country-wise research sentiment, and then age and local weather, showing the most importance.

439,Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated-transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapeutic development.",James Chen; Brandon Malone; Eliza Llewellyn; Michael Grasso; Patrick M.

440,Favipiravir and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hamster model,"Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Here we used a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its pharmacokinetics. When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. The antiviral efficacy observed in this study was achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials and was associated with weight losses in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.","Driouich, J.-S.; Cochin, M.; Lingas, G.; Moureau, G.; Touret, F.; Petit, P.-R.; Piorkowski, G.; Barthelemy, K.; Coutard, B.; Guedj, J.; de Lamballerie, X.; Solas, C.; Nougairede, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
441,The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","Tavares, R. d.

442,SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds ribosomal mRNA channel to inhibit translation,"The non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), also referred to as the host shutoff factor, is the first viral protein that is synthesized in SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells to suppress host innate immune functions1,2. By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5’ untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Schubert, K.; Karousis, E.

443,Unique transcriptional changes in coagulation cascade genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells: A potential factor in COVID-19 coagulopathies,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.

Sixty-one siRNA molecules, predicted by the bioinformatics programs, were screened for the possibility of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using an in vitro plaque assay. Among six siRNA leads with the efficacy of reducing plaque number, the siRNA targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced fever and virus titer in the Golden Syrian hamster and rhesus macaque.

445,A Fluorescence-based High Throughput-Screening assay for the SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

446,Spike protein fusion loop controls SARS-CoV-2 fusogenicity and infectivity,"The Spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We have investigated the Spike from six β-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β-coronavirus MHV-A59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo. The Spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.Summary The Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is the prime mediator of COVID-191 because of its central role in virus-host attachment, virus-entry, and virus-spread2. The contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the Spike glycoprotein3, its high affinity of binding to human ACE2 receptor4, and cleavage5. While these may be imperative, it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity. Here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of SARS-CoV-2 Spike that triggers the virus fusion, distinguishes it from the other five β-coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic, including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides. The fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive β-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β-coronavirus, MHV-A59 studies6. The synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process, which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Pal, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
447,"Genes Encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Related Proteins Mediating SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry are Upregulated with Age in Human Cardiomyocytes","Age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in patients following COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Robinson, E.

448,A rapidly adaptable biomaterial vaccine for SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Langellotto, F.; Seiler, B.

449,Alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks by integer linear programming: SARS-CoV-2,"Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","Llabres, M.; Valiente, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
450,The evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within the coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus,"SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2 receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","Wells, H.

We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate pre-challenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal pre-screening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.

453,Conserved Genomic Terminals of SARS-CoV-2 as Co-evolving Functional Elements and Potential Therapeutic Targets,"ABSTRACTTo identify features in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3’-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3’-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, A.

454,Comparison of Transgenic and Adenovirus hACE2 Mouse Models for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Rathnasinghe, R.; Strohmeier, S.; Amanat, F.; Gillespie, V.

455,Identification of potent and safe antiviral therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xiao, X.; Wang, C.; Chang, D.; Wang, Y.; Dong, X.; Jiao, T.; Zhao, Z.; Ren, L.; Dela Cruz, C.

456,N and O glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motifs on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sanda, M.; Morrison, L.; Goldman, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
457,Discovery of Drug-like Ligands for the Mac1 Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3,"ABSTRACTThe Mac1 domain of the multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) is a potential COVID-19 drug target because it is suspected to enhance the ability of the virus to evade the human immune system. The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain binds ADP-ribose and proteins harboring this important post-translational modification. Small molecules that bind the Mac1 domain in place of ADP-ribose might therefore be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for antiviral drug discovery. Two high throughput screens were used here to identify such ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. The first screen used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, aka the thermal shift or ThermoFluor assay) to examine the melting temperature of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain in the presence of various compounds. In the second screen, various high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structures were used with Autodock VINA to identify potential ligands. Numerous hit compounds were either steroids (estradiol valerate &amp; flunisolide), beta-lactams (cefaclor &amp; cefatrizine), or benzimidazoles (telmisartan, rabeprazole, omeprazole, &amp; esomeprazole). Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to confirm that rabeprazole, omeprazole, and compounds in other chemical classes, such as irinotecan, nifedipine, trifluoperazine, bind SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with an affinity similar to ADP-ribose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Virdi, R.

458,Gene Expression Network Analysis Provides Potential Targets Against SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTBACKGROUND Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

459,Renal carcinoma is associated with increased risk of coronavirus infections,"The current pandemic COVID-19 has affected most severely to the people with old age, or with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and cancers. Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors’ expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tripathi, S.

460,SARS-CoV-2 contributes to altering the post-transcriptional regulatory networks across human tissues by sponging RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key pos-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Srivastava, R.; Daulatabad, S.

461,Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity,"AbstractTo dissect the mechanisms underlying the observed inflation of variants in SARS-CoV-2 genome, we present the largest up-to-date analysis of intra-host genomic diversity, which reveals that the majority of samples present a complex sublineage architecture, due to the interplay between host-related mutational processes and transmission dynamics.Strikingly, the deconvolution of the entire set of intra-host variants reveals the existence of mutually exclusive viral mutational signatures, which prove that distinct hosts differently respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Graudenzi, A.; Maspero, D.; Angaroni, F.; Piazza, R.; Ramazzotti, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
462,Comparison of three TaqMan Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2,"Quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for COVID-19 control. Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively).

463,Snapshot of the evolution and mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history. Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhao, J.; zhai, x.; Zhou, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1,2020-07-05,2020-07-05,,False
464,A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global pathogen1,2, sparking urgent vaccine development efforts with the trimeric spike3,4. However, the inability of antibodies like CR30225, which binds a cryptic spike epitope with nanomolar affinity6, to neutralize virus, suggests a spike-based means of neutralization escape. Here, we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have 10% the unfolding enthalpy of a globular protein at physiological pH, where it is recognized by antibodies like CR3022, and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where it sheds such antibodies, suggesting that the spike evades potentially neutralizing antibody through a pH-dependent mechanism of conformational masking. To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH. In the absence of ACE2, cryo-EM analyses indicated lower pH to reduce conformational heterogeneity. Single-receptor binding domain (RBD)-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH through lowering of RBD and refolding of a pH-dependent switch. Notably, the emerging Asp614Gly strain7 partially destabilizes the switch that locks RBD down, thereby enhancing functional interactions with ACE2 while reducing evasion by conformational masking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhou, T.; Tsybovsky, Y.; Olia, A.

They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV.

466,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant D614G increases infectivity and retains sensitivity to antibodies that target the receptor binding domain,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus worldwide in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of various mammalian ACE2 orthologs. Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.","Yurkovetskiy, L.; Pascal, K.

Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","Park, C.; Lee, J.; Hassan, Z. U.; Ku, K. B.; Kim, S. J.; Kim, H.

470,Map of SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes not shielded by glycans.,"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, calls for the urgent development of a vaccine. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sikora, M.; von Bülow, S.; Blanc, F.

471,A CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay that is robust against viral evolution and RNA editing,"Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations.

Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 clades that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sapoval, N.; Mahmoud, M.; Jochum, M.

An investigation of the viral distribution within the human body in correlation to tissue damage can help understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.We present a detailed mapping of viral RNA in 61 tissues and organs of 11 deceased patients with the diagnosis COVID-19. The autopsies were performed within the (very) early postmortem interval (mean: 5.6 hours) to avoid bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Viral loads, blood levels of cytokines, prothrombotic factors as well as macro- and micro-morphology were correlated.Very high (&gt; 104 copies/ml) viral loads were detected in the lungs of most patients and then correlated to severe tissue damage. Intact viral particles could be verified in the lung tissue by transmission electron microscopy. Viral loads in the lymph nodes were associated with a loss of follicular architecture. Viral RNA was detected throughout further extra-pulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage. Inflammatory cytokines as well as the prothrombotic factors were elevated in all patients.In conclusion, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2-RNA throughout the body supports the hypothesis of a maladaptive host response with viremia and multi-organ dysfunction.View Full Text","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Wittschieber, D.; Sanft, J.; Kleemann, S.; Elschner, S.; Haupt, K.

475,Using iCn3D and the World Wide Web for structure-based collaborative research: Analyzing molecular interactions at the root of COVID-19,"ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Youkharibache, P.; Cachau, R.

We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies.

477,Association between neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and commercial serological assays,"Introduction Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tang, M.

480,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for large amounts of diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA, which commercial suppliers are increasingly unable to deliver. In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","Kalnina, L.; Mateu-Regue, A.; Oerum, S.; Hald, A.; Gerstoft, J.; Oerum, H.; Cilius Nielsen, F.; Iversen, A.

We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Sheffield, UK. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sub-genomic RNA. We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis. Finally variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sub-genomic RNAs with high fidelity in most cases.

482,Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundRT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

ConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","Chaix, M.-L.; Wirden, M.; Feghoul, L.; Bertine, M.; Nere, M.-L.; Le Hingrat, Q.; Abdi, B.; Boutolleau, D.; Ferre, V.

483,Assessment of Proton-Coupled Conformational Dynamics of SARS and MERS Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases: Implication for Designing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Inhibitors,"Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future ones. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine.

484,High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity.

485,Discovery of Synergistic and Antagonistic Drug Combinations against SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro,"COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Bobrowski, T.; Chen, L.; Eastman, R.

486,Attenuated Subcomponent Vaccine Design Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein RNA Binding Domain: In silico analysis,"ABSTRACTThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has previously never been identified with humans, thereby creating devastation in public health. The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chukwudozie, O.

487,SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals are likely expanded by beta-coronaviruses,"The current pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and large progress in understanding the pathology of the virus has been made since its emergence in late 2019. Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Stervbo, U.; Rahmann, S.; Roch, T.; Westhoff, T.

488,Genetic architecture of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2,"Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid  in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

489,Next-generation diagnostics: virus capture facilitates a sensitive viral diagnosis for epizootic and zoonotic pathogens including SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.

MethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.

ResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.

ConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","Wylezich, C.; Calvelage, S.; Schlottau, K.; Ziegler, U.; Pohlmann, A.; Hoeper, D.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False
490,If the link missed：Could inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increase the risk of COVID-19?,"Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emerged globally. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is crucial for SARS-COV-2 entering into the cells. The expression of ACE2 in skin suggested that skin might be a way of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. We found the elevated ACE2 level of patients with psoriasis but downregulated after IL-17 antibody treatment. Further results showed that ACE2 expression increased either in psoriasis or in atopic dermatitis, which were typical inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction. And elevated ACE2 level was also detected in mouse models of dermatitis induced by imiquimod, calcipotriol, repeated tape-stripping or 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) respectively. Moreover, alleviation of cutaneous inflammation with skin recovery moisture also lowered expression of ACE2 in mouse models with barrier deteriorated inflammatory skin disorders. Furthermore, inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increased the penetration of topical FITC conjugated spike protein into the skin. Conversely, improvement in skin permeability barrier could prevent this penetration. Thus, indicating the special link between inflammatory skin disorders with skin barrier dysfunction and increasing risk of COVID-19.","Xu, Q.; Chen, L.; Zhang, L.; Li, X.; Zheng, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False
491,Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from North Africa: viral origins and mutational spectrum,"In Morocco two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded. The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.

At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.

Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries.

492,Early data on the performance of a combined SARS-CoV-2 spike-nucleocapsid antibody lateral flow device compared to a nucleocapsid-only device,"Background There is a critical need for reliable antibody detection methods in order to study and evaluate the public health and clinical response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices offer the prospect of rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), but the performance of these devices must be evaluated for robustness before they can be adopted for routine clinical and public health use.Methods Plasma and serum specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n = 131) and RNA-negative (n = 16) patients were taken from various time points with respect to the onset of symptoms. All 147 anonymised specimens were tested for IgM and IgG using the Hangzhou AllTest 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and the Abbexa COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit.Results IgM sensitivity ranged from 13% to 68%, depending on the date of symptom onset and the device. Regarding IgG, the Abbexa device outperformed the Hangzhou device at all cumulative timeline brackets, with sensitivity of 97·87% (Abbexa) versus 68·09% (Hangzhou) for samples beyond 21 days from symptom onset. Day 21 was therefore chosen as the cut-off for ascertaining test performance characteristics, beyond which the specificity was 100% for both devices and negative predictive value was 0·94 (Abbexa) versus 0·50 (Hangzhou).Discussion Based on this limited dataset, the performance characteristics of the Abbexa LFIA device were substantially better than those of the Hangzhou device. Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device meets the minimum (98%) sensitivity and specificity thresholds set by the UK Medicine &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou that targets only the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Linares, C.

We find that at low frequencies, the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations. Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values and exhibits no other peaks apart from one associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent that characterizes the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.","Tan, H.

495,Mutations from bat ACE2 orthologs markedly enhance ACE2-Fc neutralization of SARS-CoV-2,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","Mou, H.; Quinlan, B.; Peng, H.; Guo, Y.; Peng, S.; Zhang, L.; Davis-Gardner, M.; Gardner, M.; Voo, Z.

To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

500,Citizen Scientists Create an Exascale Computer to Combat COVID-19,"The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten global health and socioeconomic stability. Experiments have revealed snapshots of many of the viral components but remain blind to moving parts of these molecular machines. To capture these essential processes, over a million citizen scientists have banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the world’s first Exascale computer and simulate protein dynamics. An unprecedented 0.1 seconds of simulation of the viral proteome reveal how the spike complex uses conformational masking to evade an immune response, conformational changes implicated in the function of other viral proteins, and ‘cryptic’ pockets that are absent in experimental snapshots.

501,A Targeted Vaccine against COVID-19: S1-Fc Vaccine Targeting the Antigen-Presenting Cell Compartment Elicits Protection against SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Vaccination efficacy is enhanced by targeting the antigen-presenting cell compartment. Here, we show that S1-Fc antigen delivery targeting the Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cell compartment elicits anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-antigen specific IgG production in vivo exerting biologically functional and protective activity against live virus infection, assessed in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay in vitro. The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our promising findings on rS1-Fc protein immunization prompted us to further develop an affordable and safe product for delivery to our communities in need for COVID-19 vaccinations.","Herrmann, A.; Maruyama, J.; Yue, C.; Lahtz, C.; Zhou, H.; Kerwin, L.; Guo, W.; Zhang, Y.; Soo Hoo, W.; Yei, S.; Kwon, S.; Fu, Y.; Johnson, S.; Ledesma, A.; Zhuang, Y.; Zhuang, Y.; Yei, E.; Adamus, T.; Praessler, S.; Ji, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178616v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178616v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False

The spike (S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). A 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycan-dependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain involving multiple protomers.

503,Structure of the full SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected cells,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models. The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lan, T.

504,A High Content Screen for Mucin-1-Reducing Compounds Identifies Fostamatinib as a Candidate for Rapid Repurposing for Acute Lung Injury during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Drug repurposing is the only method capable of delivering treatments on the shortened time-scale required for patients afflicted with lung disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","Malimova, M.; Sidhom, E.-H.; Satyam, A.; Dvela-Levitt, M.; Melanson, M.; Chamberlain, B.

505,Validation and Comparison of a Modified CDC Assay with two Commercially Available Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Specimen,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the globe since it was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.","Lima, A.; Healer, V.; Vendrone, E.; Silbert, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179192v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179192v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False
506,SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Human Lung Alveolar Type 2 Cells Elicits a Rapid Epithelial-Intrinsic Inflammatory Response,"ABSTRACTThe most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Huang, J.; Hume, A.

507,"A Fast and Accessible Method for the Isolation of RNA, DNA, and Protein to Facilitate the Detection of SARS-CoV-2","Management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Ponce-Rojas, J.

508,Anti-frameshifting ligand active against SARS coronavirus-2 is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins. Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress −1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of −1 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Neupane, K.; Munshi, S.; Zhao, M.; Ritchie, D.

509,Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-EM,"The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xu, C.; Wang, Y.; Liu, C.; Zhang, C.; Han, W.; Hong, X.; Wang, Y.; Hong, Q.; Wang, S.; Zhao, Q.; Wang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Chen, K.; Zheng, W.; Kong, L.; Wang, F.; Zuo, Q.; Huang, Z.; Cong, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False

We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 (n=7). The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects (n=6) or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women (n=2).

511,Phosphorylation modulates liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1–3. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7–11. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12–15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Carlson, C.

516,Assessment of the use and quick preparation of saliva for rapid microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of direct real time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in heated saliva samples, avoiding the RNA isolation step. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs together with saliva samples were obtained from 51 patients clinically diagnosed as potentially having COVID-19. Two different methods were compared: 1. RNA was extracted from 500 l of sample using a MagNA Pure Compact Instrument with an elution volume of 50l and 2. 700{micro}L of saliva were heat-inactivated at 96{degrees}C for 15 minutes, and directly subjected to RT-PCR. One step real time RT-PCR was performed using 5 l of extracted RNA or directly from 5 l of heated sample. RT-PCR was performed targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene region. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the results of the RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 81.08%, 92.86%, 96.77% and 65.00%, respectively when RNA extraction was included in the protocol with saliva, whereas sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83.78%, 92.86%, 68.42% and 96.88%, respectively, for the heat-inactivation protocol. However, when the analysis was performed exclusively on saliva samples with a limited time from the onset of symptoms (<9 days, N=28), these values were 90%, 87.5%, 44% and 98.75% for the heat-inactivation protocol. The study showed that RT-PCR can be performed using saliva in an RNA extraction free protocol, showing good sensitivity and specificity.","Vila, J.; Fernandez-Pittol, M.; Hurtado, J.

517,Rational Design of the Remdesivir Binding Site in the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Potential Resistance,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Padhi, A.; Shukla, R.; Tripathi, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
518,Role of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different cohorts: Can they provide clues for appropriate patient triaging?,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global health crisis. Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were positive for serum IgG, 13 (72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%) patients did not present with any COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria. All 4 (100%) patients that were positive by rRT-PCR had symptoms of COVID-19 disease. A longitudinal study from the inpatient population suggested there was a sharp increase in the serum IgG titers in 5 patients, a moderate increase in 1 patient and a plateau in 3 patients. Sero-prevalence of COVID-19 disease in pre-procedure patients was 5.5%. Our findings suggest serological tests can be used for appropriate patient triaging when performed as an adjunct to existing molecular testing.","Mutnal, M. B.; Mohammad, A. A.; Arroliga, A.

519,Angiotensin-(3-4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection,"The renal lesions – including severe acute kidney injury – are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Luzes, R.; Muzi-Filho, H.; Pereira-Acacio, A.; Crisostomo, T.; Vieyra, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
520,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and boosts proinflammatory activity,"ABSTRACTThere is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

521,An in vitro assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral preparations of iodine complexes (RENESSANS),"Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 g/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 g/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 g/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication ({Delta}CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively).

522,SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathological damage and constitutes an antiviral target,"Cytokine storm and multi-organ failure are the main causes of SARS-CoV-2-related death. However, the origin of the virus excessively damaging abilities remains unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is sufficient to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damage in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 2-E protein induced rapid pyroptosis-like cell death in various susceptible cells and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen. Overexpressed 2-E protein formed cation channels in host cell membranes, eventually leading to membrane rupture. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, their channel inhibition, cell protection and antiviral activities were positively correlated with each other, supporting 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Gao, Z.; Xia, B.; Shen, X.; He, Y.; Pan, X.; Wang, Y.; Yang, F.; Fang, S.; Wu, Y.; Zuo, X.; Xie, Z.; Jiang, X.; Chi, H.; Meng, Q.; Zhou, H.; Zhou, Y.; Cheng, X.; Cheng, T.; Xin, X.; Jiang, H.; Xiao, G.; Zhao, Q.; Zhang, L.-K.; Shen, J.; Li, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
523,Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. We systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sekine, T.; Perez-Potti, A.; Rivera-Ballesteros, O.; Straling, K.; Gorin, J.-B.; Olsson, A.; Llewellyn-Lacey, S.; Kamal, H.; Bogdanovic, G.; Muschiol, S.; Wulliman, D.

524,Comprehensive annotations of the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a fast and accurate pipeline,"In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain). We believe this will aid in the surveillance of any proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever-increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.","Rahman, M.

525,Perversely expressed long noncoding RNAs can alter host response and viral proliferation in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundSince December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.

ResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.

ConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","Turjya, R.

However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.","Suresh, V.; Parida, D.; Minz, A.

527,"Integrate Structural Analysis, Isoform Diversity, and Interferon-Inductive Propensity of ACE2 to Refine SARS-CoV2 Susceptibility Prediction in Vertebrates","The current new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused globally near 0.4/6 million confirmed deaths/infected cases across more than 200 countries. As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, E.

528,A facile Q-RT-PCR assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has infected millions within just a few months and is continuing to spread around the globe causing immense respiratory disease and mortality. Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.

ImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.","Shema Mugisha, C.; Vuong, H.

529,Critical Sequence Hot-spots for Binding of nCOV-2019 to ACE2 as Evaluated by Molecular Simulations,"The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors.

530,"Structures, conformations and distributions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers on intact virions","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude. Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind the ACE2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells. S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with neutralizing antibodies.","Ke, Z.; Oton, J.; Qu, K.; Cortese, M.; Zila, V.; McKeane, L.; Nakane, T.; Zivanov, J.; Neufeldt, C.

531,Modified Vaccinia Ankara Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Expressing Full-Length Spike Induces Strong Neutralizing Antibody Response,"There is a great need for the development of vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Routhu, N.

532,Binding Ability Prediction between Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Reveals the Adaptive Strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in Humans,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.","Xue, X.; Shi, J.; Xu, H.; Qin, Y.; Yang, Z.; Feng, S.; Liu, D.; Jian, L.; Hua, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Huang, X.; Zhang, X.; Li, X.; Chen, C.; Guo, J.; Tang, W.; Liu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1,2020-06-27,2020-06-27,,False

Detection of the viral genome through RT-qPCR is the golden standard for this test, however, the high demand of the materials and reagents needed to sample individuals, purify the viral RNA, and perform the RT-qPCR test has resulted in a worldwide shortage of several of these supplies. Here, we show that directly lysed saliva samples can serve as a suitable source for viral RNA detection that is cheaper and can be as efficient as the classical protocol that involves column purification of the viral RNA. In addition, it surpasses the need for swab sampling, decreases the risk of the healthcare personnel involved in this process, and accelerates the diagnostic procedure.","Moreno-Contreras, J.; Espinoza, M.

We recently illustrated that leukemia patients are identified by machine learning (ML) based on their blood transcriptomes. However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed because of privacy legislation. To facilitate integration of any omics data from any data owner world-wide without violating privacy laws, we here introduce Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized machine learning approach uniting edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination as well as privacy protection without the need for a central coordinator thereby going beyond federated learning. Using more than 14,000 blood transcriptomes derived from over 100 individual studies with non-uniform distribution of cases and controls and significant study biases, we illustrate the feasibility of SL to develop disease classifiers based on distributed data for COVID-19, tuberculosis or leukemias that outperform those developed at individual sites. Still, SL completely protects local privacy regulations by design.

We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus prior to RNA extraction, thus significantly improving detection of the virus using a real-time RT-PCR assay across a range of viral titers, from 100 to 1,000,000 viral copies/mL; in particular, detection of virus in low viral load samples is enhanced when using the method coupled with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit.

Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.","Barclay, R.

536,Tipiracil binds to uridine site and inhibits Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease with C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family. It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme’s active site, providing basis for the uracil scaffold-based drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Kim, Y.; Wower, J.; Maltseva, N.; Chang, C.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Wilamowski, M.; Kang, S.; Nicolaescu, V.; Randall, G.; Michalska, K.; Joachimiak, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False
537,Evaluation of K18-hACE2 mice as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract/SummaryMurine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical for elucidating the biological pathways underlying COVID-19 disease. Because human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing the human ACE2 gene have shown promise as a potential model for COVID-19. Five mice from the transgenic mouse strain K18-hACE2 were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020. Mice were followed twice daily for five days and scored for weight loss and clinical symptoms. Infected mice did not exhibit any signs of infection until day four, when weight loss, but no other obvious clinical symptoms were observed. By day five all infected mice had lost around 10% of their original body weight, but exhibited variable clinical symptoms. All infected mice showed high viral titers in the lungs as well as altered lung histology associated with proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar septal thickening. Overall, these results show that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can be established in the K18-hACE2 transgenic background and should be a useful mouse model for COVID-19 disease.","Moreau, G.

Compared to recombinant S, the viral S is more heavily glycosylated and occurs predominantly in a closed pre-fusion conformation. We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges that give the globular domain unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of safe vaccines.

The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the {beta}-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (37S and 267A) were found to exist only in its N protein, along with an extended {beta}-hairpin in the N-Terminal Domain. Collectively, this study strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789, providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein found in these coronaviruses.

We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamic simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions.

Reports indicate that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from CNS symptoms. Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of infection are. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection of human brain organoids, clear evidence of infection was observed, with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons. Further, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Finally, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality.

544,Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane,"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.)

Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection. Our data have therefore delivered a key genomic resource for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission research and enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, D.; Wang, Y.; Sun, W.; Zhang, L.; Ji, J.; Zhang, Z.; Cheng, X.; Li, Y.; Xiao, F.; Zhu, A.; Zhong, B.; Ruan, S.; Li, J.; Ren, P.; Ou, Z.; Xiao, M.; Li, M.; Deng, Z.; Zhong, H.; Li, F.; Chen, W.; Zhu, S.; Wang, W.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, X.; Jin, X.; Zhao, J.; Zhong, N.; Zhang, W.; Zhao, J.; Li, J.; Xu, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173203v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173203v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False
547,Glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Control the Receptor Binding Domain Conformation,"The glycan shield of the beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) Spike (S) glycoprotein provides protection from host immune responses, acting as a steric block to potentially neutralizing antibody responses. The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Henderson, R.; Edwards, R.

548,Elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of cystine and theanine through transcriptome analysis of mice and comparison with COVID-19 gene set data,"We previously showed that oral administration of cystine and theanine (CT) to mice confers resistance to influenza virus infection. In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.","Mitsui, A.; Sakai, R.; Miwa, K.; Shibahara, S.; Kurihara, S.; Nagao, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False

They widely exist in the environment, with characteristics of variety, spreading quickly and easily causing adverse reactions. In this work, an Ag-based material is used to be incorporated and functionalized in polycotton fabrics using pad-dry-cure method. This composite proved to be effective for inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decreasing the number of replicates in 99.99% after an incubation period of 2 minutes.

550,"Molecular features similarities between SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS and key human genes could favour the viral infections and trigger collateral effects","In December 2019 rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel {beta}-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide causing thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses. The results presented here, settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.","Maldonado, L.; Kamenetzky, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167072v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167072v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False
551,Increased Expression of Chondroitin Sulfotransferases following AngII may Contribute to Pathophysiology Underlying Covid-19 Respiratory Failure: Impact may be Exacerbated by Decline in Arylsulfatase B Activity,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to respiratory epithelium through the ACE2 receptor, an endogenous receptor for Angiotensin II (AngII). The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets.","Bhattacharyya, S.; Kotlo, K.; Tobacman, J.

Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","Sjaarda, C.

553,Cellular exocytosis gene (EXOC6/6B): a potential molecular link for the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19 in diabetic patients,"Diabetes is one of the most critical comorbidities linked to an increased risk of severe complications in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6/6B compared to healthy lungs.

554,Antiviral Drug Screen of Kinase inhibitors Identifies Cellular Signaling Pathways Critical for SARS-CoV-2 Replication,"Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

Until now, there are no available antiviral drugs have been reported that can effectively block virus infection. The study aimed to discover the potential compounds to prevent viral spike proteins to bind to the human ACE2 proteins from Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds (TDEC) by structure-based virtual screening. In this study, to rapidly discover potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the molecular docking calculation was performed by AutoDock Vina program.

557,Molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 structural genes: evidence of positive selection in spike glycoprotein,"SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in early 2020 and has resulted in more than 8,000,000 infections as well as 430,000 deaths in the world so far. Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","Zhan, X.-Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhou, X.; Huang, K.; Qian, Y.; Leng, Y.; Yan, L.; Huang, B.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False
558,"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs","BackgroundThe newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.

MethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

ResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

The power inherent in publicly available data can be demonstrated via comparative transcriptome analyses. In the current study, we collected high-throughput gene expression data related to human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses (SARS, H1N1, rhinovirus, avian influenza, and Dhori) and compared the effect of these viruses on the human transcriptome. The analyses identified fifteen genes specifically expressed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2; these included CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and S100A8 and S100A9 (calcium-binding proteins), all of which are involved in lung/respiratory disorders. The analyses showed that genes involved in the Type1 interferon signaling pathway and the apoptosis process are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, results of protein-protein interaction analyses were consistent with a functional role of CSF2 in COVID-19 disease.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in patient samples and are used extensively in clinical settings. Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection. Overall, these findings highlight the need for assay validation and optimization and demonstrate the inability to precisely compare viral quantification from different PCR methodologies without calibration.","Ratcliff, J.; Nguyen, D.; Andersson, M.; Simmonds, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.168013v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.168013v1?rss=1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,,False
561,CoronaHiT: large scale multiplexing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Nanopore sequencing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started in China in late 2019. Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 24 samples at a time. There is a need for a higher throughput method to reduce cost per genome. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 95 small genomes on a single Nanopore flowcell, which uses transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of symmetric barcodes. We demonstrate the method using 48 and 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per flowcell, amplified using the ARTIC protocol, and compare performance with Illumina and ARTIC ONT sequencing. Results demonstrate that all sequencing methods produce inaccurate genomes when the RNA extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical sample has a cycle threshold (Ct) >= 32. Results from set same set of 23 samples with a broad range of Cts show that the consensus genomes have >90% coverage (GISAID criteria) for 78.2% of samples for CoronaHiT-48, 73.9% for CoronaHiT-94, 78.2% for Illumina and 73.9% for ARTIC ONT, and all have the same clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per nanopore flowcell without compromising the quality of the resulting genomes while reducing library preparation complexity and significantly reducing cost. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.","Baker, D. J.; Kay, G. L.; Aydin, A.; Le-Viet, T.; Rudder, S.; Tedim, A.

562,SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human fetal and pediatric gastric organoids,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global public health emergency. COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Giobbe, G.

563,"Pixatimod (PG545), a clinical-stage heparan sulfate mimetic, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus","A major global effort is currently ongoing to search for therapeutics and vaccines to treat or prevent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Repurposing existing entities is one attractive approach. The heparan sulfate mimetic pixatimod is a clinical-stage synthetic sulfated compound that is a potent inhibitor of the glycosidase heparanase, and has known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and also antiviral properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and alters its conformation. Notably, this site overlaps with the known ACE2 binding site in the S1 RBD. We find that pixatimod inhibits binding of recombinant S1 RBD to Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, in assays with three different isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus we show that pixatimod effectively inhibits viral infection of Vero cells. Importantly, its potency is well within its safe therapeutic dose range. These data provide evidence that pixatimod is a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. Together with its other known activities this provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation as a new multimodal therapeutic for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Guimond, S.

Materials & methodsBioinformatics tools were used to analyse and predict cis-acting regulatory elements by obtaining viral sequences from available databases.

ResultsComputational analysis prediction revealed the presence of RNA stem-loop structures within the 3 end of the ORF1ab region that are analogous to the previously identified SARS-CoV genomic packaging signals. Alignment-based RNA secondary structures prediction of the 5 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified also conserved CREs.

565,Integration of viral transcriptome sequencing with structure and sequence motifs predicts novel regulatory elements in SARS-CoV-2,"In the last twenty years, three separate coronaviruses have left their typical animal hosts and became human pathogens. An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral pathogenicity.","Cox, B.

566,Lung expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules and antiviral restriction factors: interindividual differences are associated with age and germline variants,"Germline variants in genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2) may influence the susceptibility to infection, as may polymorphisms in genes involved in the innate host response to viruses (e.g. APOBEC3 family). We searched for polymorphisms acting, in lung tissue, as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, whose expression levels did not associate with either sex or age of the 408 patients whose non-diseased lung tissue was analyzed. Instead, we identified seven cis-eQTLs (FDR<0.05) for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G (rs139296, rs9611092, rs139331, rs8177832, rs17537581, rs61362448, and rs738469). The genetic control of the expression of APOBEC3 genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication, may explain interindividual differences in risk or severity of viral infections. Future studies should investigate the role of host genetics in COVID-19 patients using a genome-wide approach, to identify other genes whose expression levels are associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

Author summaryIdentification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has become commonplace in functional studies on the role of individual genetic variants in susceptibility to diseases. In COVID-19, it has been proposed that individual variants in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and innate host response genes may influence the susceptibility to infection. We searched for polymorphisms acting, in non-diseased lung tissue of 408 patients, as eQTLs for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. Seven cis-eQTLs were detected for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. Therefore, the identified eQTLs may represent candidate loci modulating interindividual differences in risk or severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","Cotroneo, C. E.; Mangano, N.; Dragani, T.

567,"Development of a fluorescence based, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay","In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.

IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis.

569,"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization","STUDY QUESTIONIs SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) expressed in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and does it participate in endometrial decidualization?

SUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).

LARGE SCALE DATAN/A.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

570,Intestinal receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in inflamed IBD tissue is downregulated by HNF4A in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon,"Patients with IBD are considered immunosuppressed, but do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19. Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.

We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.

Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.","Verstockt, B.; Verstockt, S.; Adbu Rahiman, S.; Ke, B.-J.; Arnauts, K.; Cleynen, I.; Sabino, J.; Ferrante, M.; Matteoli, G.; Vermeire, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,,False
571,N-glycosylation network construction and analysis to modify glycans on the spike S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background The spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is N-glycosylated. The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies. Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine development work.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Krishnan, S.; Krishnan, G.

572,A nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 for rapid neutralization testing and screening of anti-infective drugs for COVID-19,"A high-throughput platform would greatly facilitate COVID-19 serological testing and antiviral screening. Here we report a nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. We demonstrate that the optimized reporter virus assay in Vero E6 cells can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera and produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluated a collection of approved and investigational antivirals and other anti-infective drugs. Nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat were identified as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 M). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 M.

Here, we report identification of CD209L/L-SIGN and a related protein, CD209/DSIGN as alternative receptors capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed a prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelial and endothelial cells of small and medium-sized vessels, whereas CD209 was detected only in a limited number of cell types. Biochemical assays revealed that ectopically expressed CD209L and CD209 bind to S-RBD and mediate SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped virus entry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human endothelial cells endogenously express CD209L and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Soluble CD209L-Fc neutralized virus entry.

575,An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (""priming"") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases. Nafamostat and camostat are currently in clinical trials against COVID19. The rank order potency for the three inhibitors is: nafamostat (IC50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC50 = 6.2 nM) and gabexate (IC50 = 130 nM). Further profiling of these three inhibitors against a panel of proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","Shrimp, J. H.; Kales, S. C.; Sanderson, P.

576,"Selection, biophysical and structural analysis of synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2","The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies constitute a key short-to-medium term approach to tackle COVID-19. However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC50 of 0.6 {micro}g/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed a novel conformation of the spike where two RBDs are in the  up ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly emerging viruses.","Custodio, T. F.; Das, H.; Sheward, D.

577,Climatic-niche evolution of SARS CoV-2,"Adaptation of species to new environments is governed by natural selection that discriminates among genetic variations and favors survival of the fittest. Here, we propose climate plays an important role in the evolution of SARS CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 all over the world which was previously not known. To understand the climatic factors responsible for shaping the molecular determinants of the novel coronavirus, genotyping SARS CoV-2 across different latitudes and Koppens climate is imperative. It seems this virus follows inverse latitudinal biodiversity gradient due to its preference towards Koppens temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed division of 176 SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2, well defined by four mutations. Initially, SARS CoV-2 was restricted to a ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) climate of southeast China, which soon spread all over the world having C climate. Genomic information superimposed on global Koppens climate map elucidates that the gradation ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) and ""marine-temperate"" (Cfb) to ""humid-continental"" (Dfa-Dfb) climate drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. It seems an early infection in Europe and USA is due to the dominance of C climate. Russia and North America were infected through linkage of C to D climate and South America from C to A climate. Our study elucidates viruses are sensitive to climate and combined genomic and climatic studies provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways during a pandemic which will enable us to take pre-emptive precautionary measures in such outbreaks.

578,Loss of pH switch unique to SARS-CoV2 supports unfamiliar virus pathology,"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","Camacho, C.

579,Structure-Based Design with Tag-Based Purification and In-Process Biotinylation Enable Streamlined Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Molecular Probes,"Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from [~]0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.","Zhou, T.; Teng, I.-T.; Olia, A.

580,SARS-CoV-2 mutations altering regulatory properties: deciphering host's and virus's perspectives,"Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its genome while spreading throughout the globe. However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, A.

581,"Expression of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in mouse ear tissue","ObjectivesIntracellular entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends on the interaction between its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depends on Furin-mediated spike 23 protein cleavage and spike protein priming by host cell proteases including 24 transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Tmprss1, Tmprss3, and Tmprss5 are expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and the organ of Corti in the inner ear; however, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the middle ear remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression in the middle and inner ear of mice.

582,A graph-based approach identifies dynamic H-bond communication networks in spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2,"Corona virus spike protein S is a large homo-trimeric protein embedded in the membrane of the virion particle. Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","Karathanou, K.; Lazaratos, M.; Bertalan, E.; Siemers, M.; Buzar, K.; Schertler, G.

583,"RAAS blockade, kidney disease, and expression of ACE2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in kidney epithelial and endothelial cells","SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells. Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney. ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of ACEi/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi/ARB use in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease. Our study illuminates the dynamics of ACE2 expression in specific kidney cells, with implications for SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenicity.","Subramanian, A.; Vernon, K.; Slyper, M.; Waldman, J.; Luecken, M.

584,"Accommodating individual travel history, global mobility, and unsampled diversity in phylogeography: a SARS-CoV-2 case study.","Spatiotemporal bias in genome sequence sampling can severely confound phylogeographic inference based on discrete trait ancestral reconstruction. This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.","Lemey, P.; Hong, S.; Hill, V.; Baele, G.; Poletto, C.; Colizza, V.; O'Toole, A.; McCrone, J.

ObjectivesTo provide preliminary results on cardiac global outcomes (such as cardiac output, ventricular pressures) obtained by means of computational models in plausible scenarios characterized by COVID-19.

MethodsWe considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system, which models, from the mechanical point of view, the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through mathematical equations of the underlying physical processes. To study the effect of COVID-19, we varied the heart rate, the contractility and the pulmonary resistances in suitable ranges.

ResultsOur computations on individuals with both otherwise normal and impaired cardiac functions revealed that COVID-19 worsen cardiac function, as shown by a decrease of some cardiac biomarkers values such as cardiac output and ejection fraction. In the case of existing impaired cardiac function, the presence of COVID-19 lead to values outside the normal ranges.

ConclusionsComputational models revealed to be an effective tool to study the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Such effect could be significant for patients with impaired cardiac function. This is especially useful to perform a sensitivity analysis of the hemodynamics for different conditions.

Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors.

590,Systemic analysis of putative SARS-CoV-2 entry and processing genes in cardiovascular tissues identifies a positive correlation of BSG with age in endothelial cells,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread throughout the world with unprecedented global healthcare and socio-economic consequences. There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19 characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four important observations: (i)Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2 and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic.

591,ViralLink: An integrated workflow to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on intracellular signalling and regulatory pathways,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. The workflow is available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/ViralLink) in an easily accessible Python wrapper script, or as customisable modular R and Python scripts.Author summary Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets and speeds the process of discovery. Such ways of working are especially important at present due to the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we present a systems biology workflow which models the effect of viral proteins on the infected host cell, to aid collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily applied to different datasets as they are made available. Application to diverse SARS-CoV-2 datasets will increase our understanding of the mechanistic details of the infection at a cell type specific level, aid drug target discovery and help explain the variety of clinical manifestations of the infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Treveil, A.; Bohar, B.; Sudhakar, P.; Gul, L.; Csabai, L.; Olbei, M.; Poletti, M.; Madgwick, M.; Andrighetti, T.; Hautefort, I.; Modos, D.; Korcsmaros, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167254v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167254v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
592,Biochemical evidence of furin specificity and potential for phospho-regulation at Spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site in SARS-CoV2 but not in SARS-CoV1 or MERS-CoV,"The Spike protein of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 contains an insertion 680SPRRAR{downarrow}SV687 forming a cleavage motif RxxR for furin-like enzymes at the boundary of S1/S2 subunits. Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR{downarrow}SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site. Although phosphoregulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.","Örd, M.; Faustova, I.; Loog, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
593,Genetic Diversity and Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 in Morocco,"COVID-A9 is an infection disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), declared as a pandemic due to its rapid expansion worldwide. In this study we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using 22 virus genome sequences reported by three different laboratories in Morocco till the date 07/06/2020 as well as (40366) virus genomes from all around the world.

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Moroccan patients revealed 62 mutations of which 30 were missense mutations. The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred one time in our sequences with no record in other sequence worldwide. These mutations should be investigated to figure out their potential effects on all around the world virulence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses pertaining to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C. This finding suggest that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. For multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country. Furthermore, very likely, the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulated in cryptic way in Morocco starting from the fifteen January before the discovering of the first case the second of March.","Badaoui, B.; Sadki, K.; Talbi, C.; Tazi, L.; Salah, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.165902v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.165902v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
594,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as ACE2 blockers to inhibit viropexis of COVID-19 Spike psedotype virus,"Background: COVID-19 has been affecting global health since the end of 2019 and so far, no any sign shows the relief of the pandemic. The major issue for controlling the infection disease is lacking efficient prevention and therapeutic approaches. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been reported to treat the disease, but underlying mechanism still keeps controversial. Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate whether CQ and HCQ could be an ACE2 blocker to inhibit COVID-19 infection. Methods: In our study, we used CCK-8 stain, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent stain to evaluated the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ respectively on ACE2 high expressed HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We further analyzed the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and molecule docking, and COVID-19 spike pseudotype virus was also used to observe the viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ in ACEh cells. Results: Results showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2h cells than CQ, both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2 with KD (7.31{+/-}0.62)e-7 and (4.82{+/-}0.87)e-7, respectively. They also exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of COVID-19 spike pseudotype virus into ACE2h cells. Conclusions: CQ and HCQ both inhibite the entrance COVID-19 virus into cell by blocking the binding of the virus with ACE2. Our finding provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of CQ and HCQ treatment effect on the virus infection.","Wang, N.; Han, S.; Liu, R.; Meng, L.; He, H.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, C.; Lv, Y.; Wang, J.; Li, X.; Ding, Y.; Fu, J.; Hou, Y.; Lu, W.; Ma, W.; Zhan, Y.; Dai, B.; Zhang, J.; Pan, X.; Hu, S.; Gao, J.; Jia, Q.; Zhang, L.; Ge, S.; Wang, S.; Liang, P.; Hu, T.; Lu, J.; Wang, X.; Zhou, H.; Ta, W.; Wang, Y.; Lu, S.; He, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164665v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164665v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
595,Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike glycoprotein putative antigenic epitopes in vitro by intracellular aminopeptidases,"Presentation of antigenic peptides by MHCI is central to cellular immune responses against viral pathogens. While adaptive immune responses versus SARS-CoV-2 can be of critical importance to both recovery and vaccine efficacy, how protein antigens from this pathogen are processed to generate antigenic peptides is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of overlapping precursor peptides spanning the entire sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, by three key enzymes that generate antigenic peptides, aminopeptidases ERAP1, ERAP2 and IRAP. All enzymes generated shorter peptides with sequences suitable for binding onto HLA alleles, but with distinct specificity fingerprints. ERAP1 was the most efficient in generating peptides 8-11 residues long, the optimal length for HLA binding, while IRAP was the least efficient. The combination of ERAP1 with ERAP2 greatly limited the variability of peptide sequences produced. Less than 7% of computationally predicted epitopes were found to be produced experimentally, suggesting that aminopeptidase processing may constitute a significant filter to epitope presentation. These experimentally generated putative epitopes could be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity studies and vaccine design. We furthermore propose that this in vitro trimming approach could constitute a general filtering method to enhance the prediction robustness for viral antigenic epitopes.","Stamatakis, G.; Samiotaki, M.; Mpakali, A.; Panayotou, G.; Stratikos, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
596,Various RNA-binding proteins and their conditional networks explain miRNA biogenesis and help to reveal the potential SARS-CoV-2 host miRNAome system,"BackgroundIn-spite of ubiquitous expression of DROSA/DICER, miRNA formation and maturation are highly spatiotemporal implying involvement of other factors in their biogenesis. Several key studies have elucidated functions of few other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in miRNAs biogenesis, making it necessary to look miRNA biogenesis models with fresh approach.

ResultsA comprehensive study of >25TB of high-throughput data revealed that various combinations of RBPs and their networks determine the miRNA pool, regardless of DROSHA/DICER. The discovered RBP and miRNA associations displayed strong functional alliances. An RBP, AAR2, was found highly associated with miRNAs biogenesis, which was experimentally validated. The RBPs combinations and networks were tested successfully across a large number of experimentally validated data and cell lines for the observed associations. The RBP networks were finally modeled into a XGBoosting-regression based tool to identify miRNA profiles without any need of doing miRNA-seq, which scored a reliable average accuracy of 91% on test sets. It was further tested across >400 independent experimental samples and scored consistently high accuracy. This tool was applied to reveal the miRNAome of Covid19 patients about which almost negligible information exists. A significant number of Covid19 specific miRNA targets were involved in IFN-gamma, Insulin/IGF/P3K/AKT, and Ub-proteasome systems, found in cross-talk with each other and down-regulated heavily, holding promise as strong candidates for therapeutic solution. A large number of them belonged to zinc-finger family.

ConclusionThere are several RBPs and their networks responsible for miRNA biogenesis, regardless of DROSHA/DICER. Modeling them successfully can reveal miRNAomes with deep reaching impact.","Pradhan, U. K.; Anand, P.; Sharma, N.

597,Companion vaccine Bioinformatic design tool reveals limited functional genomic variability of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain,"Tracking the genetic variability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for several reasons, such as to identify target sequences to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution; and to mine for viral variants associated with reduced or increased severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic analyses have been released for this purpose; four main viral clades have been described via phylogenetic analyses. Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (April-June 2020) confirms no high variability pressure on the viral genome in terms of quality and quantity of mutations. We then focused our analysis on the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein and only found a few variants associated with particular geographic locations that should be tracked over time. Finally, additional immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility and T-cell recognition for most frequent human HLAs.","Massacci, A.; D'Ambrosio, L.; Sperandio, E.; Palombo, F.; Aurisicchio, L.; Ciliberto, G.; Pallocca, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.133355v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.133355v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
598,"Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is a promising candidate for COVID-19 prophylaxis","COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (1), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 (2). While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7 were shortlisted for validation. We show for the first time that the active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol, exhibits significant potent activity against SARS-CoV-2.

599,"In vivo antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age","Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-{kappa}B signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","Lieberman, N.
