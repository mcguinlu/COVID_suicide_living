0,On COVID-19-safety ranking of seats in intercontinental commercial aircrafts: A preliminary multiphysics computational perspective,"The evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into a pandemic has severely hampered the usage of public transit systems. In a post-COVID-19 world, we may see an increased reliance on autonomous cars and personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with inherent physical distancing, over buses, trains, and aircraft for intracity, intercity, and interstate travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted from the nose/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy of the aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).","Desai, P.

1,"Keep calm and carry on: safety, feasibility and early outcomes of head and neck cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Patients with cancer are considered at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and increased severity of infection. Anti-cancer treatment may further increase those risks. The aim of this work is to report early outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated during the pandemic. Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study in a UK tertiary level oncology centre between 1st March and 23 June 2020, including patients with HNC who were either newly diagnosed, had developed new recurrent/metastatic disease, or were already scheduled to receive treatment during that period. Results 200 patients were evaluated. Median age was 64 years, 65.5% had multiple co-morbidities, 77.5% were current or ex-smokers and 59.5% lived in areas of deprivation. 99 patients were treated with 6 weeks of radical (chemo) radiotherapy. Systemic anti-cancer treatment was delivered to 40 patients. 2 (1.0%) patients with HNC had confirmed COVID-19 infection; 1 patient prior to primary radical RT - no delay to treatment was required and RT was completed as planned, 1 patient acquired COVID-19 after primary surgery but recovered well and started adjuvant RT 9.7 weeks after surgery. The proportion of patients receiving supportive care only (19.5%) was in keeping with that pre-COVID-19. The proportion of patients not completing (chemo) radiotherapy (3.4%) or with gaps in treatment (14.1%) was similar to pre-COVID-19. 30-day mortality after radical (chemo)radiotherapy was 2.3%, no higher than in previous years. Conclusions It is feasible and safe to deliver standard treatment for patients with HNC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Walker, S.; Thomson, M. C.; Campbell, F.; Hay, L.

2,"Accurately Differentiating COVID-19, Other Viral Infection, and Healthy Individuals Using Multimodal Features via Late Fusion Learning","Effectively identifying COVID-19 patients using non-PCR clinical data is critical for the optimal clinical outcomes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants' clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.","Xu, M.; Ouyang, L.; Gao, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yu, T.; Li, Q.; Sun, K.; Bao, F.

3,"Decline of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and IgA in convalescent COVID-19 patients within 100 days after hospital discharge","Monitoring the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies such as IgG, M and A in COVID-19 patient is an alternative method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and an simple way to monitor immune responses in convalescent patients and after vaccination. Here, we assessed the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in twenty-seven COVID-19 convalescent patients over 28-99 days after hospital discharge. Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients' RBD-specific IgG reaches to an undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively. This investigation and report will aid current and future studies to develope SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are potent and long-lasting.","Ma, H.; Zhao, D.; Zeng, W.; Yang, Y.; Hu, X.; Zhou, P.; Weng, J.; Cheng, L.; Zheng, X.; Jin, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20175950v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20175950v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
4,"Pediatric surgical services in Bangladesh during the COVID 19 pandemic: How they are affected and how to overcome the backlog, keeping healthcare professionals safe.","Background: Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has turned into a pandemic. All countries have implemented multiple strategies to try mitigating the losses caused by this virus. To stop the rapid spread of the disease and in compliance with the World Health Organizations social distancing policy, the government of Bangladesh has implemented a number of strategies, one of which is to limit the spread of the virus in hospitals by postponing elective procedures and providing only emergency services in the hospitals. The objective of this survey was to assess the current status of pediatric surgical procedures in different hospitals in Bangladesh and assess the effects of the current restrictions along with their implications in the long run. Materials and Methods: A survey was performed among doctors from public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the status on pediatric surgery. Results: The results clearly revealed the lack of a significant reduction in doctors exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by postponing elective procedures. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the socioeconomic and health care conditions of the country, the author recommend resuming elective surgical procedures.

5,Real-time spatial health surveillance: mapping the UK COVID-19 epidemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","Fry, R.; Hollinghurst, J.; Stagg, H.

6,Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy,"Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19. They point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways and set the stage for larger prospective trials that will benchmark these complement-targeting agents in COVID-19.","Mastellos, D.

7,The Mental Health of Healthcare Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: It Depends on How Much They Work and Their Age,"Background: Healthcare staff are the forefront of fight against COVID-19 and they are under enormous pressure due to the fast growth in the number and severity of infected cases. This creates their mental issues such as distress, depression and anxiety. Exploring healthcare staff's mental health during the pandemic contributes to improving their persistence in the growing challenges created by COVID-19 and enabling effective management of their mental health. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all the 31 provinces of Iran was conducted during April 5 to 20, 2020. The survey assessed staff's distress, depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff suffered from distress, depression and anxiety. Females and more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Compared to personnel who did not have COVID-19, those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression. The number of COVID-19 cases among the staff's colleagues or friends positively predicted their anxiety. Compared to radio technologists, doctors were less likely to experience distress and anxiety. Technicians and obstetrics experienced less anxiety. Analysis the interaction between weekly working days and age of the staff indicated the chance of experiencing distress and depression varied greatly by working days among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: Exploring the potential predictors of mental health issues assists healthcare organizations to develop approaches to prevent and decrease the issues among staff and improve their task performance in sever crises such as COVID-19, so they can stay motivated in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is useful to identify more working characteristic predictors for healthcare staff at different ages.","Xu, X.; Zhang, S.

8,Summer COVID-19 third wave: faster high altitude spread suggests high UV adaptation,"We present spread parameters for first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemy for USA states, and third wave for 32 regions (19 countries and 13 states of the USA) detected beginning of August 2020. USA first/second wave spreads increase/decrease with population density, are uncorrelated with temperature and median population age. Pooling all 32 regions, third wave spread is slower than for first wave, similar to second wave, and increases with mean altitude (second wave slopes decrease above 900m). Apparently, viruses adapted in spring (second wave) to high temperatures and infecting the young, and in summer (third) waves for spread at altitudes above 1000m. Third wave slopes are not correlated to temperature, so patterns with elevation presumably indicate resistance to relatively high UV regimes. Environmental trends of the COVID-19 pandemy change at incredible rates, making predictions based on classical epidemiological knowledge particularly uncertain.","Seligmann, H.; Vuillerme, N.; Demongeot, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176628v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176628v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
9,COVID-19: Exhaled virus detected by Face Mask Sampling provides new links to disease severity and potential infectivity.,"Background Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) are the mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two studies. Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up. Interpretation FMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe disease.","Williams, C.; Pan, D.; Decker, J.; Wisniewska, A.; Sze, S.; Fletcher, E.; Haigh, R.; Abdulwhhab, M.; Bird, P.; Holmes, C.; Al-Taie, A.; Saleem, B.; Pan, J.; Garton, N.; Pareek, M.; Barer, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
10,Clinical Characterisation of Lateral Flow Assays for Detection of COVID-19 Antibodies in a population,"Importance: Serological assays can help diagnose and determine the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population. Objective: We characterized and compared 11 different lateral flow assays for their performance in diagnostic or epidemiological settings. Design, Setting, Participants: We used two cohorts to determine the speci- ficity: (i) up to 350 blood donor samples from past influenza seasons and (ii) up to 110 samples which tested PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Switzerland. The sensitivity was determined using up to 370 samples which tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same time and is representative for age distribution and severity. Main Outcome: We found a single test usable for epidemiological studies in the current low-prevalence setting, all other tests showed lacking sensitivity or specificity for a usage in either epidemiological or diagnostic setting. However, orthogonal testing by combining two tests without common cross-reactivities makes testing in a low-prevalence setting feasible. Results: Nine out of the eleven tests showed specificities below 99%, only five of eleven tests showed sensitivities comparable to established ELISAs, and only one ful- filled both criteria. Contrary to previous results from lab assays, five tests measured an IgM response in >80% of the samples. We found no common cross-reactivities, which allows orthogonal testing schemes for five tests of sufficient sensitivities. Conclusions and Relevance: This study emphasizes the need for large and diverse negative cohorts when determining specificities, and for diverse and repre- sentative positive samples when determining sensitivities of lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Failure to adhere to statistically relevant sample sizes or cohorts exclusively made up of hospitalised patients fails to accurately capture the performance of these assays in epidemiological settings. Our results allow a rational choice between tests for different use cases.","rudolf, f.; Kaltenbach, H.-M.; linnik, J.; Ruf, M.-T.; Niederhauser, C.; Nickel, B.; Gygax, D.; Savic, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177204v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177204v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
11,"Comparing the Fit of N95, KN95, Surgical, and Cloth Face Masks and Assessing the Accuracy of Fit Checking","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has made well-fitting face masks a critical piece of protective equipment for healthcare workers and civilians. While the importance of wearing face masks has been acknowledged, there remains a lack of understanding about the role of good fit in rendering protective equipment useful. In addition, supply chain constraints have caused some organizations to abandon traditional quantitative or qualitative fit testing, and instead, have implemented subjective fit checking. Our study seeks to quantitatively evaluate the level of fit offered by various types of masks, and most importantly, assess the accuracy of implementing fit checks by comparing fit check results to quantitative fit testing results. Methods: Seven participants first evaluated N95 and KN95 masks by performing a fit check. Participants then underwent quantitative fit testing wearing five N95 masks, a KN95 mask, a surgical mask, and fabric masks. Results: N95 masks offered higher degrees of protection than the other categories of masks tested; however, it should be noted that most N95 masks failed to fit the participants adequately. Fit check responses had poor correlation with quantitative fit scores. All non-N95 masks achieved low fit scores. Conclusion: Fit is critical to the level of protection offered by masks. For an N95 mask to provide the promised protection, it must fit the participant. Performing a fit check was an unreliable way of determining fit.","O'Kelly, E.; Arora, A.; Pirog, S.; Ward, J.; Clarkson, P.

12,The ImmuneRACE Study: A Prospective Multicohort Study of Immune Response Action to COVID-19 Events with the ImmuneCODE™ Open Access Database,"Background: Adaptive Biotechnologies has built an immune medicine platform based on the sequencing of immune receptors (immunoglobulins, B-cell receptors [BCRs] and T-cell receptors [TCRs]) with myriad applications in health and disease. This broad platform technology can be used to assess the diversity of the cellular adaptive immune system and track disease-associated TCRs and BCRs during the course of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading rapidly throughout the world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Researchers, governments, and biotechnology companies are mobilizing to develop and distribute diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives to try to curb this global pandemic. Methods: In collaboration with our partners LabCorp/Covance, Adaptive Biotechnologies has opened the ImmuneRACE study to prospectively collect samples from individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, or who have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: We believe that the information contained within the genetics of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can improve our understanding of the immunobiology of this devasting virus and may inform efforts to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate scientific and clinical advancement in the fight against COVID-19, the TCR sequence data resulting from the primary aims of this study will be made publicly available to scientists and researchers across the globe, an effort made possible through a collaboration with Microsoft.

13,"ESTIMATING CUMULATIVE COVID-19 INFECTIONS BY A NOVEL ""PANDEMIC RATE EQUATION""","A fundamental problem dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has been to estimate the rate of infection, since so many cases are asymptomatic and contagious just for a few weeks. For example, in the US, estimate the proportion P(t) = N/330 where N is the US total who have ever been infected (in millions)at time t (months, t =0 being March 20). This is important for decisions on social restrictions, and allocation of medical resources, etc. However, the demand for extensive testing has not produced good estimates. In the US, the CDC has used the blood supply to sample for anti-bodies. Anti-bodies do not tell the whole picture, according to the Karolinska Instituet , many post infection cases show T-cell immunity, but no anti-bodies. We introduce a method based on a difference-differential equation (dde) for P(t). We emphasize that this is just for the present, with no prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The dde uses only x=x(s), which is the number/million testing positive, and y=y(s), the number/million who have been tested for all time 0 < s < t (months), with no assumptions on the dynamics of the pandemic. However, we need two parameters. First, R , the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected cases. Second, T , the period of active infection when the virus can be detected. Both are random variables with distribution which can be estimated. For fixed R, we prove uniform bounds (1+ R) x/(y +1) < P(t) < (1+ R) x(t) , are best possible, with range depending on T . One advantage of our theory is being able to estimate P for many regions and countries where x and y is the only information available.","Hamilton, D.

14,Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19-positive patients in Bangladesh,"Background: As of August 15, 2020, Bangladesh lost 3591 lives since the first Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case announced on March 8. The objective of the study was to report the clinical manifestation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: A online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted for initial recruitment of participants with subsequent telephone interview by the three trained physicians in 237 adults with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. The study period was between 27 April to 26th May, 2020. Consent was ensured before commencing the interview. Collected data were entered in a predesigned case report form and subsequently analyzed by SPSS 20. Results: The mean age at presentation was 41.59 (13.73 SD) years and most of the cases were male (73%). A total of 90.29% of patients reside in urban areas. Among the positive cases, 13.1% (n=31) were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic cases were significantly more common in households with 2 to 4 members (p=.008). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients shared similar ages of presentation (p=0.23), gender differences (p=0.30), and comorbidities (p=0.11). Only 5.3% of patients received ICU care during their treatment. The most frequent presentation was fever (88.3%), followed by cough (69.9%), chest pain (34.5%), body ache (31.1%), and sore throat (30.1%). Thirty-nine percent (n=92) of the patients had comorbidities, with diabetes and hypertension being the most frequently observed. Conclusion: There has been an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. Patients were mostly middle-aged and male. Typical presentations were fever and cough.

15,"Use, reuse or discard: quantitatively defined variance in N95 respirator integrity following vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: COVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking. Aims: 1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination. Methods: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP. Findings: There was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions. Conclusions: Our data revealed variability in the integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and reuse programs.","Levine, C.; Grady, C.; Block, T.; Hurley, H.; Russo, R.; Peixoto, B.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
16,A DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION USING CHEST X-RAY IMAGES IN HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 PATIENTS,"Purpose: Early identification of a potentially deteriorating clinical course in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical since there exists a resource-demand gap for the ventilators. Materials: We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based approach to predict the need for mechanical ventilation as early as at the time of initial radiographic evaluation. We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images derived from 528 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for purpose of validation. Results: We found that our deep learning model predicted the need for ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately three days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24-13.25%. Conclusion: Our deep learning model accurately predicted the need for mechanical ventilation early during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. Until effective preventive or treatment measures become widely available for COVID-19 patients, prognostic stratification as provided by our model is likely to be highly valuable.","Kulkarni, A.

17,Urban Sprawl of Covid-19 Epidemic in India: Lessons in the First Semester,"Background and Objective: The covid-19 epidemic is rapidly escalating in India and unlike developed countries there is no evidence of plateau or decline in the past 6 months. To evaluate association of state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study. Methods: Publicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained and cases and deaths/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearson correlation and logarithmic trends. Results: Covid-19 in India has led to more than 2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large variation in state-level cases/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to less than 300/million in a few. Deaths/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51 (Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r= 0.65, R squared= 0.35) and deaths (r= 0.60, R squared= 0.28) and weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables. From March to July 2020, stable R squared value for urbanization is observed with cases (0.37 to 0.39) while it is increasing for deaths (0.10 to 0.28). Conclusions: Covid-19 epidemic is escalating in India and cases as well as deaths are significantly greater in more urbanized states. Prevention, control and treatment should focus on urban health systems.","Gupta, R.; Dhamija, R. K.; Gaur, K.; Khedar, R.

18,Breastmilk; a source of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies,"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many put their hopes in the rapid development of effective immunizations. For now patient isolation, physical distancing and good hygiene are the sole measures for prevention. Processed breast milk with antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 may serve as additional protection. We aimed to determine the presence and neutralization capacity of antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 in breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig. To assess the effect of pasteurization breastmilk was exposed to Holder Pasteurization and High Pressure Pasteurization. Results: Breastmilk contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using any of the assays in 24 out of 29 (83%) proven cases, in six out of nine (67%) suspected cases and in none of the 13 controls. In vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate virus strain was successful in a subset of serum (13%) and milk samples (26%). Although after pasteurization of the milk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected with both methods of pasteurization, virus neutralizing capacity of those antibodies was only retained with the HPP approach. Conclusion: Breastmilk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19 contains significant amounts of IgA against SARS-CoV-2, both before and after pasteurization.","van Keulen, B.

20,Retrospective screening of routine respiratory samples revealed undetected community transmission and missed intervention opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom,"In the early phases of the SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, testing focused on individuals fitting a strict case definition involving a limited set of symptoms together with an identified epidemiological risk, such as contact with an infected individual or travel to a high-risk area. To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea - also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","Chappell, J.

21,"Severity-stratified and longitudinal analysis of VWF/ADAMTS13 imbalance, altered fibrin crosslinking and inhibition of fibrinolysis as contributors to COVID-19 coagulopathy","Background: Early clinical reports have suggested that the prevalence of thrombotic complications in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 may be as high as 30% in intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients and could be a major factor contributing to mortality. However, mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombo-coagulopathy, and its impact on patient morbidity and mortality, are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation and thromboinflammatory factors in plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Furthermore, we assessed the functional impact of these factors on clot formation and clot lysis. Results: Across all COVID-19 disease severities (mild, moderate and severe) we observed a significant increase (6-fold) in the concentration of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers compared to healthy controls. This is likely the result of an interleukin (IL)-6 driven imbalance of VWF and the regulatory protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Upregulation of this key pro-coagulant pathway may also be influenced by the observed increase (~6-fold) in plasma -defensins, a consequence of increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil activation. Markers of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte activation were accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of Factor XIII (FXIII) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. In patients with high FXIII we observed alteration of the fibrin network structure in in vitro assays of clot formation, which coupled with increased PAI-1, prolonged the time to clot lysis by the t-PA/plasmin fibrinolytic pathway by 52% across all COVID-19 patients (n=23). Conclusions: We show that an imbalance in the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis causing increased VWF reactivity may contribute to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Through immune and inflammatory responses, COVID-19 also alters the balance of factors involved in fibrin generation and fibrinolysis which accounts for the persistent fibrin deposition previously observed in post-mortem lung tissue.","South, K.; Roberts, L.; Morris, L.

22,REPERCUSSIONS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF PREGNANT AND PUERPERAL WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW,"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused negative impacts on the physical and mental health of the population worldwide. Pregnant and puerperal women comprise the population most vulnerable to impacts on mental health. Objective: To synthesize the scientific evidence on the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women. Methods: systematic review focused on answering the question what is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnan and puerperal women?. In order to perform the search of the studies, we used combinations among the keywords: pregnan*, puerper*, prenatal, perinatal, mental health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. In total, we identified 150 studies from the databases and 14 studies were selected from preprints. We identified another four studies through manual search, totaling 18 studies to compose the final sample of this review. Results: Anxiety and depression were the main outcomes found, being shown in 15 and 11 studies, respectively. Other outcomes found in more than one study were: concerns related to several factors, loneliness, stress and fear. Conclusion: From this review, we can infer that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women, with depression and anxiety being the most frequent changes. The social detachment, the media pressure, the fear of contracting the infection, the economic scenario and the rupture of family rituals are shown as intensifying factors of psychological distress, thus causing changes in the mental health of these women.","Vieira, L.

23,SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in lungs of African green monkeys,"Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for unraveling the viral and host factors that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes. Our dataset provides a detailed view of changes in host and virus replication dynamics over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.","Speranza, E.; Williamson, B.

High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gorshkov, K.; Chen, C. Z.; de la Torre, J.

25,SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies provides insight into its genetic dynamics during infection,"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first- to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as 'One-King'): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The 'One-King' model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","Sun, F.; Wang, X.; Tan, S.; Dan, Y.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Xu, J.; Tan, Z.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Zhang, W.; Chen, Y.; Tan, W.; Deng, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False

The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir.

Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R. gammac KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, T.-D.; Vir, P.; Shashikumar, S.; Karim, A.

29,What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents? Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify mutation signatures and classify SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a Bag of Words (BoW) to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the distribution of the identified mutation signatures on the global map of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","Nagpal, S.; Srivastava, D.; Mande, S.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides a methodology for the generation of preventive and therapeutic antibody drugs for emerging infectious diseases.","Han, X.; Wang, Y.; Li, S.; Tang, N.; Hu, C.; Li, T.; Xie, Y.; Shen, M.; Wang, J.; Gu, C.; Hu, J.; Gong, F.; Wu, R.; Gao, F.; Huang, J.; Mu, S.; Luo, F.; Long, Y.; Song, S.; Long, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, Q.; Li, L.; Wu, Y.; Xu, W.; Cai, X.; Gao, Q.; Zhang, G.; He, C.; Wang, K.; Deng, K.; Du, L.; Nai, Y.; Wang, W.; Huang, A.; Jin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
31,COVID-19: Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in the United States before Phased Removal of Social Distancing Protections Varies by Region,"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in January 2020, there is no quantified effect size for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to control the outbreak in the continental US. Objective. To quantify national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs in the US. Design. This is an observational study for which we obtained daily county level COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22, 2020 through the phased removal of social distancing protections. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT) analytical approach is used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Data include 3142 counties from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures. County-level NPIs were obtained from online county and state policy databases, then classified into four intervention levels: Level 1 (low), declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate), school closures, restricting nursing home access, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high), non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive). sheltering in place / stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. Additional county-level data were obtained to record racial (Black, Hispanic), economic (educational level, poverty), demographic (rural/urban) and climate factors (temperature, specific humidity, solar radiation). Main Outcomes. The primary outcomes are rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case doubling times. NPI effects are measured separately for nine US Census Region (Pacific, Mountain, West North Central, East North Central, West South Central, East South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England). Results. Aggressive NPIs (level 4) significantly reduced COVID-19 case and death rates in all US Census Regions, with effect sizes ranging from 4.1% to 25.7% and 5.5% to 25.5%, respectively, for each day they were active. No other intervention level achieved significance across all US Regions. Intervention levels 3 and 4 both increased COVID-19 doubling times, with effects peaking at 25 and 40 days after initiation of each policy, respectively. The effectiveness of level 3 NPIs varied, reducing case rates in all regions except North Central states, but associated with significantly higher death rates in all regions except Pacific states. Intervention levels 1 and 2 did not indicate any effect on COVID-19 propagation and, in some regions, these interventions were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Heterogeneity of NPI effects are associated with racial composition, poverty, urban-rural environment, and climate factors. Conclusion. Aggressive NPIs are effective tools to reduce COVID-19 propagation and mortality. Reducing social and environmental disparities may improve NPI effects in regions where less strict policies are in place.","Pan, W.; Tyrovolas, S.; Gine Vazquez, I.; Raj, R.; Fernandez, D.; Zaitchik, B.; Lantos, P.; Woods, C.

To facilitate these objectives, we have profiled the repertoire of human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II)-bound peptides presented by HLA-DR diverse monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region.

34,"Air pollution, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 outcomes: A state-of-the-science review of a rapidly evolving research area","Background: As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, 692,000 (August 7, 2020) human lives and counting have been lost worldwide to COVID-19. Understanding the relationship between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for developing solutions to this global crisis. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. Method: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria; we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional study design. Results: 27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes. Discussion: We discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability in testing, mitigation measures and pandemic stage, clustering of health outcomes, and a lack of publicly available data and code.","Bhaskar, A.; Chandra, J.; Braun, D.; Cellini, J.; Dominici, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,True
35,Exploring G and C-quadruplex structures as potential targets against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.","Belmonte Reche, E.; Serrano-Chacon, I.; Gonzalez, C.; Gallo, J.; Banobre-Lopez, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257493v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257493v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
36,RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine BNT162b2 Selected for a Pivotal Efficacy Study,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have spread to millions of people globally. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. Conclusion: These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.","Walsh, E. E.; Frenck, R.; Falsey, A.

39,SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c Is a Membrane-Associated Protein that Suppresses Antiviral Responses in Cells,"Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

40,The necessary cooperation between governments and public in the fight against COVID-19: why non-pharmaceutical interventions may be ineffective,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures. However the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the population's disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.","Borges, C. M.; Coelho, M.

Methods: An observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of Australians who received an AR between the 26 January to the 23 June 2020. The main outcome measures were patient diagnostic category proportions and trends prior (28 January to 15 March), during (16 March to 4 May), and following (5 May to 23 June 2020) social isolation restrictions. Results: There were 16981 ARs consisting of 1959 (11.5) primary evacuations (PE) and 12724 (88.5) inter-hospital transfer (IHT), with a population median age of 52 years old (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0 69.0), with 49.0% (n= 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n= 6399) being female. There were a total of 6 confirmed and 209 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases (n=114; 53.0%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups. This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods (OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02 1.24 and OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08 1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in the post restriction period (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04 1.64), and increases for congenital conditions in the restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39 4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53 0.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for a retrievals of the respiratory system (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67 0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.6 1.0). Distribution between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (p<0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a significant reduction in activity. Conclusion: The lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital conditions. However, this period also resulted in a reduction of overall activity, possibly due to a reduction in other infectious disease rates, such as influenza, due to social distancing.","Gardiner, F.

42,Boosting SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR detection combining pool sample strategy and mathematical modeling,"qRT-PCR is the gold standard technique available for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the long test run time and costs associated with this type of molecular testing are a challenge in the actual pandemic scenario. Due to high testing demand, pooling sample strategy is an interesting approach to allow cost savings. We aim to evaluate pooling tests in experimental procedures, as well as perform in silico statistical modeling analysis validated with specimen samples obtained from a mass testing program of Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Although the sensitivity reduction in samples pooled with 32 individuals was observed, the high-test sensitivity is maintained even when 16 and 8 samples were pooled. The in silico analysis showed high-cost savings in populations with positive rates lower than 15.0% according to the pool size. This data was validated with the results obtained in our mass testing program: statistical modeling predicted a cost saving of 48.0%, which in practice, was 51.5%, already considering the expenditures with pool sampling that were analyzed individually. Our data confirmed that mathematical modeling is a powerful strategy to improve the pooling approach for SARS-CoV-2 mass testing around the world while maintaining high sensitivity and robustness.","Correa, I.

Our data showed that CTSL, rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from COVID-19 patients. Dysregulation of protein translation, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism was detected in multiple organs. Our data suggested upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperinflammation might be triggered which in turn induces damage of gas exchange barrier in the lung, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrosis in the lung, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and thyroid. Evidence for testicular injuries included reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis and sperm mobility.

44,Effects of case- and population-based COVID-19 interventions in Taiwan,"In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, broad usage of non-pharmaceutical interventions played a crucial role in controlling epidemics. However, the substantial economic and societal costs of continuous use of border controls, travel restrictions, and physical distancing measures suggest that these measures may not be sustainable and that policymakers have to seek strategies to lift the restrictions. Taiwan was one of the few countries that demonstrated initial success in eliminating the COVID-19 outbreak without strict lockdown or school closure. To understand the key contributors to the successful control, we applied a stochastic branching model to empirical case data to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of more targeted case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and less targeted population-based interventions (including social distancing and face mask use) in Taiwan. We found that case-based interventions alone would not be sufficient to contain the epidemic, even in a setting where a highly efficient contact tracing program was in place.

45,Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

Author SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world.

46,Information given by websites selling home self-sampling COVID-19 tests: An analysis of accuracy and completeness,"Objectives: To assess the accuracy and completeness of information provided by websites selling home self-sampling and testing kits for COVID-19. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: All websites (n=27) selling direct to user home self-sampling and testing for COVID-19 (41 tests) in the UK (39 tests) and US (2 tests) identified by a website search on 23rd May 2020. Main outcome measures: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. Results: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32/41; 78%), when to use the test (10/41; 24%), test accuracy (12/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27/41 (66%) tests); we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values). For molecular virus tests, 9/23 (39%) websites explained that test positives should self-isolate, and 8/23 (35%) explained that test negatives may still have the disease. For antibody tests, 12/18 (67%) websites explained that testing positive does not necessarily infer immunity from future infection. Seven (39%) websites selling antibody tests claimed the test had a CE mark, when they were for a different intended use (venous blood rather than finger-prick samples). Conclusions: At the point of online purchase of home self-sampling COVID-19 tests, users in the UK are provided with incomplete, and in some cases misleading information on test accuracy, intended use and test interpretation. Best practice guidance for communication about tests to the public should be developed and enforced for online sales of COVID-19 tests.","Taylor-Phillips, S.; Berhane, S.; Sitch, A.; Freeman, K.; Price, M.; Davenport, C.; Geppert, J.; Harris, I.; Osokogu, O.; Skrybant, M.; Deeks, J.

47,Suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell response associated with the prominent HLA-A*02:01 phenotype,"An improved understanding of human T-cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 is important if we are to optimize therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T-cell memory to shared peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2. Following re-infection, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells enhance recovery and diminish clinical severity. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in vitro, with CD4+ sets being typically robust. For CD8+ T-cells taken directly ex vivo, we identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, A2/S269-277 and A2/Orf1ab3183-3191. Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of the A2/S269+CD8+ and A2/Orf1ab3183+CD8+ populations indicated that the more prominent A2/S269+CD8+ set was detected at comparable frequency (1.3x10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. But, while the numbers were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (2.5x10-6), they were low when compared with frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M158) and EBV-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (1.38x10-4) populations. Phenotypic analysis ex vivo of A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents showed that A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells were predominantly negative for the CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T-cells were granzyme and/or perforin-positive. Furthermore, the bias towards naive, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T-cell activation. Priming with an appropriate vaccine may thus have great value for optimizing protective CD8+ T-cell immunity in COVID-19.","Habel, J. R.; Nguyen, T. H. O.; van de Sandt, C. E.; Juno, J.

48,"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19, Prevalence of Pre-Existing Conditions, and Access to Essential Resources and Health Services in Somali IDP Camps","Background: Three million internally displaced Somalis live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities, and inaccessible health services. This vulnerable population is especially susceptible to COVID-19, which is expected to have worsened health outcomes and exacerbate existing structural challenges in the implementation of public health measures. This study examines knowledge of COVID-19, self-reported prevalence of preexisting conditions, and access to essential health services among residents of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Somalia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design assessing demographics, current health profiles, knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, and access to resources was used. 401 Somali IDP camp residents completed the survey. Results: Though 77% of respondents reported taking at least one COVID-19 preventative public health measure, respondents reported a severe lack of access to adequate sanitation, an inability to practice social distancing, and nearly universal inability to receive a COVID-19 screening exam. Questions assessing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 prevention and treatment yielded answers of ""I don't know"" for roughly 50% of responses. The majority were not familiar with basic information about the virus or confident that they could receive medical services if infected. Those who perceived their health status to be ""fair,"" as opposed to ""good,"" showed 5.69 times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19. Respondents who felt more anxious or nervous and those who introduced one behavioral change to protect against COVID-19 transmission showed 10.16 and 5.20 times increased odds of being concerned about disease contraction, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights immense gaps in the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 and access to treatment and preventative services among individuals living in Somali IDP camps. A massive influx of additional resources is required to adequately address COVID-19 in Somalia, starting with educating those individuals most vulnerable to infection.","Alawa, J.; Walz, L.

49,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in pregnant women: characterization of symptoms and syndromes predictive of disease and severity through real-time, remote participatory epidemiology.","Background: From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women have been considered at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality. However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community. Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. Study design: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects. Results: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes. Conclusions: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Molteni, E.; Astley, C. M.; Ma, W.; Sudre, C. H.; Magee, L.

50,Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers,"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab)2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab)2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","Cunha, L.

51,Drug Repurposing Screen for Compounds Inhibiting the Cytopathic Effect of SARS-CoV-2,"Drug repurposing is a rapid approach to identifying therapeutics for the treatment of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. To address the urgent need for treatment options, we carried out a quantitative high-throughput screen using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic assay with a compound collection of 8,810 approved and investigational drugs, mechanism-based bioactive compounds, and natural products. Three hundred and nineteen compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were identified and confirmed, including 91 approved drug and 49 investigational drugs. Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported. Chlorprothixene, methotrimeprazine, and piperacetazine were the three most potent FDA approved drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These three compounds have not been previously reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, although their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus have been reported.

52,Bacterial modification of the host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modulates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.

We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","Oulas, A.; Zanti, M.; Tomazou, M.; Zachariou, M.; Minadakis, G.; Bourdakou, M.

Here we present for the first time that whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication. Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Fan, H.; Luo, Y.; Hong, B.; Wang, L.; Jin, X.; Chen, Y.; Hu, Y.; Li, T.; Zhuang, H.; Zhou, Y.-H.; Tong, Y.-G.; Xiang, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False
55,IFITM proteins promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) restrict numerous viral pathogens and are thought to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues. Our finding that IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under conditions approximating the in vivo situation shows that they may promote viral invasion during COVID-19.

56,In-depth blood proteome profiling analysis revealed distinct functional characteristics of plasma proteins between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over ten million patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor. Consequently, this study supports the development of blood biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to aid clinical decision-making and subsequently improve prognosis of COVID-19.","Park, J.; Kim, H.; Kim, S.

57,Spike protein mutational landscape in India: Could Mullers ratchet be a future game-changer for COVID-19?,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

SignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, R.; Basak, K.; Ghosh, A.; Rajachandran, V.; Sureka, K.; Ganguly, D.; Chattopadhyay, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False
58,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Depends on Heparan Sulfates and Is Blocked by Low Molecular Weight Heparins,"The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and new outbreaks worldwide highlight the need for preventive treatments. Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed by epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization. These results have imperative implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal an important target for novel prophylactic intervention.","Bermejo-Jambrina, M.; Eder, J.; Kaptein, T.

59,KG-COVID-19: a framework to produce customized knowledge graphs for COVID-19 response,"Integrated, up-to-date data about SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial for the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the biomedical research community. While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.

BIGGER PICTUREAn effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. KG-COVID-19 is a framework for producing knowledge graphs that can be customized for downstream applications including machine learning tasks, hypothesis-based querying, and browsable user interface to enable researchers to explore COVID-19 data and discover relationships.","Reese, J.

60,Erythroid precursors and progenitors suppress adaptive immunity and get invaded by SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, S.; Xu, L.; Osman, M.; Sligl, W.; Shields, J.; Joyce, M.; Tyrrell, L.; Oyegbami, O.; Elahi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

62,A Lymph Node Targeted Amphiphile Vaccine Induces Potent Cellular and Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to public health, economic, and social consequences that mandate urgent development of effective vaccines to contain or eradicate infection. To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, M. P.; Seenappa, L.

63,Quantifying the efficiency of non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, governments around the World have implemented a combination of public health responses based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), with significant social and economic consequences. Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","Garchitorena, A.; Gruson, H.; Cazelles, B.; ROCHE, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
64,On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data,"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible- Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.","TOVISSODE, C. F.; LOKONON, B.

65,COVID-19 ICU and mechanical ventilation patient characteristics and outcomes - A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background Insight into COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient characteristics, rates and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and associated outcomes as well as any regional discrepancies is critical in this pandemic for individual case management and overall resource planning. Methods and Findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes. Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","Chang, R.; Elhusseiny, K.

66,Acute Peritoneal Dialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Bellevue Hospital in New York City,"The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented strain on hospitals in New York City. Although practitioners focused on the pulmonary devastation, resources for the provision of dialysis proved to be more constrained. To deal with these shortfalls, NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue, NYU Brooklyn, NYU Medical Center and the New York Harbor VA Healthcare System, put together a plan to offset the anticipated increased needs for kidney replacement therapy. Prior to the pandemic, peritoneal dialysis was not used for acute kidney injury at Bellevue Hospital. We were able to rapidly establish an acute peritoneal dialysis program at Bellevue Hospital for acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit. A dedicated surgery team was assembled to work with the nephrologists for bedside placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheters. A multi-disciplinary team was trained by the lead nephrologist to deliver peritoneal dialysis in the intensive care unit. Between April 8, 2020 and May 8, 2020, 39 peritoneal dialysis catheters were placed at Bellevue Hospital. 38 patients were successfully started on peritoneal dialysis. As of June 10, 2020, 16 patients recovered renal function. One end stage kidney disease patient was converted to peritoneal dialysis and was discharged. One catheter was poorly functioning, and the patient was changed to hemodialysis before recovering renal function. There were no episodes of peritonitis and nine incidents of minor leaking, which resolved. Some patients received successful peritoneal dialysis while being ventilated in the prone position. In summary, despite severe shortages of staff, supplies and dialysis machines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to rapidly implement a de novo peritoneal dialysis program which enabled provision of adequate kidney replacement therapy to all admitted patients who needed it. Our experience is a model for the use of acute peritoneal dialysis in crisis situations.","Caplin, N.

67,Heart disease mortality during the early pandemic period in the United States.,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been associated with decreases in acute myocardial infarction diagnoses (AMI) and admissions in the United States. Whether this affected heart disease deaths is unknown. Objective: To determine whether changes in heart disease deaths occurred during the early pandemic period in the US, we analyzed areas without large COVID-19 outbreaks. This isolated the effect of decreased healthcare-seeking behavior during the early outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed an observational study of heart disease-specific mortality using National Center for Health Statistics data (NCHS). Weekly provisional counts were disaggregated by jurisdiction of occurrence during 2019 and 2020 for all-cause deaths, COVID-19 deaths, and heart disease deaths. For the primary analysis, jurisdictions were included if; 1) There was no all-cause excess mortality during the early pandemic period (weeks 14-17, 2020); 2) The completeness of that data was estimated by NCHS to be >97% as of July 22, 2020, and; 3) Decreases in emergency department (ED) visits occurred during the study period. We compared heart disease death rates during the early pandemic period with corresponding weeks in 2019 and a pre-pandemic control period of 2020 as a sensitivity analysis. Incident rate and rate ratios were calculated. Exposure: The US COVID-19 outbreak. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of heart disease deaths. Results: Twelve states met the primary inclusion criteria, capturing 747,375,188 person-weeks for the early pandemic period and 740,987,984 person-weeks for the 2019 control period. The mean incidence rate (per 100,000 person-weeks) for heart disease in states without excess deaths during the early pandemic period was 3.95 (95% CI 3.83 to 4.06) versus 4.19 (95% CI 4.14 to 4.23) during the corresponding period in 2019. The incident rate ratio (2020/2019) was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). No state recorded an increase from either the corresponding period in 2019 or the 2020 pre-pandemic control period. Two states recorded fewer heart disease deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: This observational study found a decrease in heart disease deaths during the early US outbreak in regions without significant COVID-19 burdens, despite decreases in ED utilization.

69,Abnormal Upregulation of Cardiovascular Disease Biomarker PLA2G7 Induced by Proinflammatory Macrophages in COVID-19 patients,"BACKGROUND. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggers distinct patterns of pneumonia progression with multiorgan disease, calling for cell- and/or tissue-type specific host injury markers. METHODS. An integrated hypothesis-free single biomarker analysis framework was performed on nasal swabs (n=484) from patients with COVID-19 in GSE152075. The origin of candidate biomarker was assessed in single-cell RNA data (GSE145926). The candidate biomarker was validated in a cross-sectional cohort (n=564) at both nucletide and protein levels. RESULTS. Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was identified as a candidate biomarker in COVID-19. PLA2G7 was predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, PLA2G7 was found in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, rather than patients suffered mild H1N1 influenza infection. The positive rates of PLA2G7 ranging from 29.37% to 100.00% were positively correlated with not only viral loads in patients with COVID-19 but also severity of pneumonia in non COVID-19 patients. Although Ct values of PLA2G7 in severe pneumonia was siginificantly lower than that in moderate pneumonia (P=7.2e-11), no differences were observed in moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 between severe pneumonia without COVID-19 (P=0.81). Serum protein levels of PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), were further found to be elevated and beyond the upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, especially among the re-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS. We firstly identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 patients at both nucletide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in COVID-19 patients. PLA2G7 could be a hallmark of COVID-19 for monitoring disease progress and therapeutic response.","LI, Y.; JIANG, Y.; ZHANG, Y.; LI, N.; YIN, Q.; LIU, L.; LV, X.; LIU, Y.; LI, A.; FANG, B.; LI, J.; YE, H.; YANG, G.; CUI, X.; LIU, Y.; QU, Y.; LI, C.; LI, J.; LI, D.; WANG, S.; GAI, Z.; ZHAN, F.; LIANG, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175505v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175505v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
70,Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter,"Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, A.; McPeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
71,Interobserver Agreement of Lung Ultrasound Findings of COVID-19,"Background: Lung ultrasound (LUS) may be used in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with COVID-19. An abnormal LUS is associated with increased risk for ICU admission in COVID-19. Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. Research Question: What is the interrater reliability of lung ultrasound findings in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: This study was conducted at conducted at two academic medical centers between 03/2020-06/2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n=4; emergency medicine: n=5) independently evaluated n=20 LUS scans (n=180 independent observations) collected from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values were used to calculate IRR. Results: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), >=3 B-lines observed (K=0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (K=0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (K=0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). Interpretation: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","Kumar, A.; Weng, Y.; Graglia, S.; Chung, S.; Duanmu, Y.; Lalani, F.; Gandhi, K.; Lobo, V.; Jensen, T.; Kugler, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176156v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176156v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True

73,Protection Level and Reusability of a Modified Full-Face Snorkel Mask as Alternative Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 drastically increased pressure on medical resources and highlighted the need for rapidly available, large-scale and low-cost personal protective equipment (PPE). In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. As the mask covers the eyes, mouth and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost and helps addressing the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles below 500 nm.","Schmitt, J.; Jones, L.

75,Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance of over ten thousand health care workers in the Providence Oregon cohort.,"ABSTRACT Frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are a high-risk population for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019 asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101 seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing, when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement, {kappa} = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","Leidner, R.; Frary, A.; Cramer, J.; Ball, D.; Weerasinghe, R.; Schmidt, M.; Jin, J.; Luzzi, V.; Saitman, A.; Young, J.

76,Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs,"Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","Della Ventura, B.; Cennamo, M.; Minopoli, A.; Campanile, R.; Bolletti Censi, S.; Terracciano, D.; Portella, G.; Velotta, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
77,"SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Antagonizes Type I and III Interferons by Targeting Multiple Components of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING Signaling Pathways","Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a catastrophic effect on human health and society. Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, L.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, J.; Nan, M.-L.; Wang, P.-H.; Gao, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False

79,"SARS-Cov-2-, HIV-1-, Ebola-neutralizing and anti-PD1 clones are predisposed","Antibody repertoire refers to the totality of the superbly diversified antibodies within an individual to cope with the vast array of possible pathogens. Despite this extreme diversity, antibodies of the same clonotype, namely public clones, have been discovered among individuals. Although some public clones could be explained by antibody convergence, public clones in naive repertoire or virus-neutralizing clones from not infected people were also discovered. All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals.

81,"Design of a highly thermotolerant, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment","Virtually all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in clinical testing are stored in a refrigerated or frozen state prior to use. This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 200mg/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, and upto 70{degrees}C in solution. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.","Malladi, S.

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries.

84,Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, D.

86,High titers of multiple antibody isotypes against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and nucleoprotein associate with better neutralization.,"Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, M.

87,Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 main protease by tafenoquine in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity.

88,In plain sight: the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in COVID-19 pathogenesis and therapeutics.,"Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases. These proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","Oguntuyo, K.

89,"Discovery of Clioquinol and Analogues as Novel Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection, ACE2 and ACE2 - Spike Protein Interaction In Vitro","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as an ongoing global pandemic. Presently, there are no clinically approved vaccines nor drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Here in, we discovered Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a FDA approved drug and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral activity showing strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction. Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for clinical development of potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Olaleye, O.

90,Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By T Cell Epitope Engineering,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S proteins immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the proteins native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigens structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","Ong, E.; Huang, X.; Pearce, R.; Zhang, Y.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
91,Differential methylation as a mediator of COVID-19 susceptibility,"The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","Steyaert, S.; Trooskens, G.; Delanghe, J.

92,In Silico Design of siRNAs Targeting Existing and Future Respiratory Viruses with VirusSi,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed global inadequacies in therapeutic options against both the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus and other newly emerged respiratory viruses. In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","Zhang, D.; Lu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
93,SRSF protein kinases 1 and 2 are essential host factors for human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2,"Antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to treat the pandemic disease COVID-19. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. Here, we performed a genome-wide screen in human lung epithelial cells to identify potential host therapeutic targets. We report that the kinase SRPK1, together with the closely related SRPK2, are jointly essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication; inhibition of SRPK1/2 with small molecules led to a dramatic decrease (more than 100,000-fold) in SARS-CoV-2 virus production in immortalized and primary human lung cells. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that SPRK1/2 phosphorylate the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at sites highly conserved across human coronaviruses and, due to this conservation, even a distantly related coronavirus was highly sensitive to an SPRK1/2 inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that SRPK1/2-targeted therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.","Heaton, B. E.; Trimarco, J.

94,"Ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells: rapid induction, prolonged contraction, and formation of functional memory","CD8+ T cells are critical for the elimination and long-lasting protection of many viral infections, but their role in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Schulien, I.; Kemming, J.; Oberhardt, V.; Wild, K.; Seidel, L.

95,Open Science Saves Lives: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In the last decade Open Science principles, such as Open Access, study preregistration, use of preprints, making available data and code, and open peer review, have been successfully advocated for and are being slowly adopted in many different research communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic many publishers and researchers have sped up their adoption of some of these Open Science practices, sometimes embracing them fully and sometimes partially or in a sub-optimal manner. In this article, we express concerns about the violation of some of the Open Science principles and its potential impact on the quality of research output. We provide evidence of the misuses of these principles at different stages of the scientific process. We call for a wider adoption of Open Science practices in the hope that this work will encourage a broader endorsement of Open Science principles and serve as a reminder that science should always be a rigorous process, reliable and transparent, especially in the context of a pandemic where research findings are being translated into practice even more rapidly.

96,Hydroxychloroquine: mechanism of action inhibiting SARS-CoV2 entry.,"BackgroundSARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic. Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry.

MethodsViral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 M propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains.

ResultsPropofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2.

ConclusionsWe conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ. HCQ disruption of the membrane appears to also disrupt the production of host defense peptide, hence an antimicrobial such as erythromycin could be an important combined treatment. Nonetheless erythromycin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may combine with HCQ to reduce infection.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and propofol?

Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to local and general anesthetics.

Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine and anesthetics appear to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering and ACE2 localization.","Yuan, Z.; Pavel, M.

97,Tissue-resident memory CD8 T-cell responses elicited by a single injection of a multi-target COVID-19 vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which enters the body principally through the nasal and larynx mucosa and progress to the lungs through the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.

Statement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","Gauttier, V.; Morello, A.; Girault, I.; Mary, C.; Belarif, L.; Desselle, A.; Wilhelm, E.; Bourquard, T.; Pengam, S.; Teppaz, G.; Thepenier, V.; Biteau, K.; De Barbeyrac, E.; Kiepferle, D.; Vasseur, B.; Le Flem, F.-X.; Debieuvre, D.; Costantini, D.; Poirier, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture.
