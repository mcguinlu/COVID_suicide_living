0,"Obesity, walking pace and risk of severe COVID-19: Analysis of UK Biobank","Obesity is an emerging risk factor for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Simple measures of physical fitness, such as self-reported walking pace, could also be important risk factors, but have not been well documented. This analysis includes 414,201 UK Biobank participants with complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data. We analysed the risk of severe (in-hospital) COVID-19 across categories of obesity status and walking pace. As of June 20th 2020 there were 972 cases of severe COVID-19 that had occurred within the cohort. Compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-9 in those with obesity was 1.49 (1.24, 1.78). Compared to those with a brisk walking pace, the OR in slow walkers was 1.84 (1.49, 2.27). Slow walkers had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 regardless of obesity status. For example, compared to normal weight brisk walkers, the odds of severe COVID-19 in obese brisk walkers was 1.39 (0.99, 1.98), whereas the odds in normal weight slow walkers was 2.48 (1.56, 3.93). Self-reported walking pace, a simple measure of functional fitness, appears to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that is independent of obesity. This may help inform simple pragmatic public health risk stratification and preventative strategies.","Yates, T.; Razieh, C.; Zaccardi, F.; Seidu, S.; Davies, M.

1,Psychological state and family functioning of University of Ibadan students during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background: The curtailment of social gatherings as well as lack of online academic engagement, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, could have potentially damaging effects on the psychological state of university students in Nigeria. This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at  0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

2,A minimal model for household effects in epidemics,"Shelter-in-place and other confinement strategies implemented in the current COVID-19 pandemic have created stratified patterns of contacts between people: close contacts within households and more distant contacts between the households. The epidemic transmission dynamics is significantly modified as a consequence. We introduce a minimal model that incorporates these household effects in the framework of mean-field theory and numerical simulations. We show that the reproduction number R0 depends on the household size in a surprising way: linearly for relatively small households, and as a square root of size for larger households. We discuss the implications of the findings for the lockdown, test, tracing, and isolation policies.","Huber, G.; Kamb, M.; Kawagoe, K.; Li, L.; Veytsman, B.; Yllanes, D.; Zigmond, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150227v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150227v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
3,Eurofins Covid-19 Sentinel TM Wastewater Test Provide Early Warning of a potential COVID-19 outbreak,"The Eurofins Covid-19 SentinelTM program was developed to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and for early detection of outbreaks. The study objective was to develop a wastewater testing method to analyze SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of community infection rate resurgence of COVID-19 or in well-defined sites such as production facilities or nursing homes. Eurofins performed >700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution & linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02%-0,1% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000). The wastewater testing method was used to monitor a Danish Community after a COVID-19 outbreak and it was shown that the method can be used as a semi-quantitative method to monitor the development of an outbreak.","Jorgensen, A.

4,What can the ideal gas say about global pandemics? Reinterpreting the basic reproduction number,"Through analysis of the ideal gas, we construct a random walk that on average matches the standard susceptible-infective-removed (SIR) model. We show that the most widely referenced parameter, the 'basic reproduction number' (R0), is fundamentally connected to the relative odds of increasing or decreasing the infectives population. As a consequence, for R0 > 1 the probability that no outbreak occurs is 1/R0. In stark contrast to a deterministic SIR, when R0 = 1.5 the random walk has a 67% chance of avoiding outbreak. Thus, an alternative, probabilistic, interpretation of R0 arises, which provides a novel estimate of the critical population density {gamma}/r without fitting SIR models. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 in the United States is consistent with our model and attempt an estimate of {gamma}/r. In doing so, we uncover a significant source of bias in public data reporting. Data are aggregated on political boundaries, which bear no concern for dispersion of population density. We show that this introduces bias in fits and parameter estimates, a concern for understanding fundamental virus parameters and for policy making. Anonymized data at the resolution required for contact tracing would afford access to {gamma}/r without fitting. The random walk SIR developed here highlights the intuition that any epidemic is stochastic and recovers all the key parameter values noted by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.","Dickson, B.

5,"A flexible COVID-19 model to assess mitigation, reopening, virus mutation and other changes","The COVID-19 epidemic which began in China last year has expanded worldwide. A flexible SEIRD epidemiological model with time-dependent parameters is applied to modeling the pandemic. The value of the effective reproduction ratio is varied to quantify the impact of quarantines and social distancing on the number of infections and deaths, on their daily changes. and on the maxima in these daily rates expected during the epidemic. The effect of changing Reff is substantial. It ought to inform policy decisions around resource allocation, mitigation strategies and their duration, and economic tradeoffs. The model can also calculate the impact of changes in infectiousness or morbidity as the virus mutates, or the expected effects of a new therapy or vaccine assumed to arrive at a future date. The paper concludes with a discussion of a potential endemic end of COVID-19, which might involve times of about 100 years.","Bienstock, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150029v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150029v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
6,Perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: A study with healthcare workers in Ghana,"Introduction: Healthcare workers' (HCWs) preparedness to respond to pandemics is critical to containing disease spread. Low-resource countries, however, experience barriers to preparedness due to limited resources. In Ghana, a country with a constrained healthcare system and high COVID-19 cases, we examined HCWs' perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 and associated factors. Methods: 472 HCWs completed questions in a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. Perceived preparedness was assessed using a 15-question scale (Cronbach alpha=0.91) and summative scores were created (range=0-45). Higher scores meant greater perceived preparedness. We used linear regression with robust standard errors to examine associations between perceived preparedness and potential predictors. Results: The average preparedness score was 24 (SD=8.9); 27.8% of HCWs felt prepared. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher perceived preparedness were: training ({beta}=3.35, 95%CI: 2.01 to 4.69); having adequate PPE ({beta}=2.27, 95%CI: 0.26 to 4.29), an isolation ward ({beta}=2.74, 95%CI: 1.15 to 4.33), and protocols for screening ({beta}=2.76, 95%CI: 0.95 to 4.58); and good perceived communication from management ({beta}=5.37, 95%CI: 4.03 to 7.90). When added to the model, perceived knowledge decreased the effect of training by 28.0%, although training remained significant, suggesting a partial mediating role. Perceived knowledge was associated with a 6-point increase in perceived preparedness score ({beta}=6.04, 95%CI: 4.19 to 7.90). Conclusion: HCWs reported low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19. Training, clear protocols, PPE availability, isolation wards, and communication play an important role in increasing preparedness. Government stakeholders must institute necessary interventions to increase HCWs' preparedness to respond to the ongoing pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.","Afulani, P. A.; Gyamerah, A.

7,Association of Cancer with Risk and Mortality of COVID-19: Results from the UK Biobank,"Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.","Shi, Z.; Resurreccion, W.

8,"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia","Introduction. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indonesia announced the first COVID-19 case on 2 March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Samarinda as the capital of East Kalimantan has been focused for its capability of handling COVID-19 patients. We report the epidemiological characteristics and immunofluorescence assay results of these patients. Methods. All patients with positive confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to hospitals and quarantine center in Samarinda. We retrospectively analyzed data from the daily report of the Samarinda City and East Kalimantan Health Office information system. Results. By June 25, 2020, 64 patients had been identified as having positive confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 {+/-} 13.8 years. Most of the patients were men (57 [90.6%] patients). Thirty-nine COVID-19 patients were imported cases with a history of traveling from South Sulawesi. Most of the patients were admitted to the Quarantine Center of Samarinda City. The mean duration from the first hospital admission for isolation to discharge was 25.6 {+/-} 13.1 days. There was only one death case of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda. There were the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Samarinda in early June 2020. There was a declining trend in the age of COVID-19 patients and the duration of isolation time in the hospital. Discussion. Imported cases still contributed to the increase of COVID-19 cases in Samarinda. Younger age of COVID-19 patients was more involved in frequent mobility which makes them cause the spread of the disease. Activation of the national reference laboratory for the COVID-19 examination in Samarinda has reduced the length of time patients treated in hospitals. Conclusion. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients show the ability of local governments to deal with this pandemic. This can be seen from the low case fatality rate in Samarinda.","Paramita, S.; Isnuwardana, R.; Rahmadi, A.; Rafshodia, O.; Kusasih, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151175v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151175v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
9,Serology in Children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19,"Objectives: We aimed to measure SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses in children hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) compared to COVID-19, Kawasaki Disease (KD) and other hospitalized pediatric controls. Methods: From March 17, 2020 - May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with MIS-C (n=10), symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n=10), KD (n=5), and hospitalized controls (n=4). With IRB approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG binding antibodies by quantitative ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed correlation analyses using linear regression. Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (R2=0.512, P<0.046) and with hospital and ICU lengths of stay (R2=0.590, P=0.010). Conclusion: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titers may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from other similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","Rostad, C.

10,Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States,"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","Olney, A.

11,Societal heterogeneity contributes to complex dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 pandemics: insights from a novel Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM),"After months of COVID-19 quarantine, businesses are reopening their doors and people are reentering society. Within the current COVID-19 data, after a slow-down of infection, a new peak in active cases is already forming. Here we developed a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM) to investigate genesis of complex pandemic patterns with the focus on the role of heterogenous societal structure. Using this model with R0 of COVID-19, we simulated viral infection in different scenarios where isolated, communities surround the main cluster of the population. Depending on the parameters of heterogeneity and isolation period, our simulations generated a multimodal growth periods with multiple peaks, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second wave of infection. We show that timing and magnitude of infection for previously unaffected isolated clusters of people, such as suburban neighborhoods, are critical aspects of these patterns. Our model can be applied to communities at any given scale of population described as a fractal-like structure, i.e. from the entire human population, to a country, down to a province or city levels with relevant societal heterogeneity structure. The current COVID-19 pandemic development worldwide and in the US follows a bimodal rise pattern, qualitatively similar to that in our simulations. We interpret our data to indicate that the secondary peak in the pattern is contributed by the states and counties in the US with late infection surges that are analogous to isolated suburbs in our model. Furthermore, the on-going early reopening, i.e. premature partial reopening in our model, is further accelerating the peak rise. This peak now reaches new heights, forcing many states in the US to reverse their policies and reestablish their quarantine measures. Our results support these timely and effective measures: we show that longer quarantine periods can reduce the number of deaths and transform the current trend into a substantially delayed (>1 year) second wave. If this scenario becomes a reality, it is important (i) to develop the vaccine and/or effective treatment before the second wave; (ii) to warn people living in suburbs that it is these isolated areas that may hold a false sense of security, but they should continue to take extra care for their public health.","Maltsev, A.

12,Addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care reduces mortality in severe COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 antibody that has been used for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing the mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of Tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care alone. Methods: Literature search for studies that compared Tocilizumab and Standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14th, 2020. Search words Tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 antibody, and COVID-19 or coronavirus 2019 in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data was gathered on an excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Five studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (>2283 males). There were thirteen retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the standard of care group and 1,153 patients in the Tocilizumab group. The death rate in the tocilizumab group, 22.4% (258/1153), was lower than the standard of care group, 26.21% (652/2,488) (Pooled odds ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.36-0.92] p=0.02). There was a significant heterogeneity (Inconsistency index= 80%) among the included studies. Conclusion: The addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care reduces mortality in severe COVID-19.

13,Serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection and analysis of IgG non-responders,"Background: To accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","Marklund, E.; Leach, S.; Axelsson, H.; Nordström, K.; Norder, H.; Bemark, M.; Angeletti, D.; Lundgren, A.; Nilsson, S.; Andersson, L.-M.; Yilmaz, A.; Lindh, M.; Liljeqvist, J.-A.; Gisslen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
14,An exploratory Integrated Moving Average Time Series Model of the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in six (6) significantly impacted Countries,"The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe. Government officials, policy makers and public health officials have been scrambling and struggling to flatten the curve to decelerate the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 given the significant economic destruction of the spread of the virus. Most flatten the curve models are based on Compartmental Models. This preliminary research is based on six (6) selected countries significantly impacted by COVID-19 and endeavors to build a new model based on moving averages lagged at different time periods to better hone in on the time the COVID-19 begins to decelerate using the date of first reported case and date of first reported death. This new model, the Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM) is based on each individual countrys date of Peak Increase in Mortality Rate (PINC MR) and the Moving Average since the peak increase in mortality rate (MA POSTINC). The CDM can be utilized of one of many quantitative tools to determine the strength of the deceleration of an infectious outbreak.","Pascarella, J.; Pascarella, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
15,Estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 with a state-space method,"After slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, many countries have started to relax their severe confinement measures in the face of critical damage to socioeconomic structures. At this point, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease; however, tracing back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, it may be possible to estimate the changes that may have occurred in the past, if we can suitably fit a proper model to daily event-occurrences. We have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. This method detects changes occurring in the spread of the contagion in each country. Furthermore, this method can assess the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number representing the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. This information might serve as a reference for the behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.","Koyama, S.; Horie, T.; Shinomoto, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150219v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150219v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
16,ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in aging mouse brain,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Through a systematic analysis of publicly available mouse brain sc/snRNA-seq data, we found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in small sub-populations of endothelial cells and mural cells, namely pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, functional changes in viral mRNA transcription and replication, and impaired blood-brain barrier regulation were most prominently implicated in the aged, ACE2-expressing endothelial cells, when compared to the young adult mouse brains. Concordant EC transcriptomic changes were further found in normal aged human brains. Overall, this work reveals an outline of ACE2 distribution in the mouse brain and identify putative brain host cells that may underlie the selective susceptibility of the aging brain to viral infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",SU Bin Lim; Valina L.

17,Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Indian state of Karnataka,"Karnataka, a state in south India, reported its first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on March 8, 2020, more than a month after the first case was reported in India. We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 47 full genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into six lineages (Pangolin lineages-A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 12 contact clusters and 11 cases with no known contacts. We found nine of the 12 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (8/12) were contained within a single district, consistent with local spread. In most of the twelve clusters, the index case (9/12) and spreaders (8/12) were symptomatic. Of the 47 sequences, 31 belonged to the B/B.6 lineage, including seven of eleven cases with no known contact, this is consistent with the ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka is consistent with multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution. This is the first study from India combining genomic data with epidemiological information emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to outbreak response.","Pattabiraman, C.; Habib, F.; PK, H.; Rasheed, R.; Reddy, V.; Dinesh, P.; Damodar, T.; Kiran Reddy, N.

18,A Highly Immunogenic Measles Virus-based Th1-biased COVID-19 Vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread world-wide with millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date. The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.
Significance: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",Cindy Hoerner; Christoph Schuermann; Arne Auste; Aileen Ebenig; Samada Muraleedharan; Maike Herrmann; Barbara Schnierle; Michael D Muehlebach,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,False
19,A simple protein-based SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assay,"With the COVID-19 pandemic surpassing 12M confirmed cases and 550K deaths worldwide, defining the key components of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical. Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present and validate a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). This test is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD and serves as a surrogate neutralization assay.Competing Interest StatementSteven J Drews has acted as a content expert for respiratory viruses for Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen).

20,"No Excess Mortality of COVID-19 in Japan until April, 2020","Background: As of the end of June, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited its highest peak on April 3. Nevertheless, no remarkable excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has been observed. Object: We sought to quantify excess mortality in April using the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) model. Method: We applied the NIID model to deaths of all causes from 1987 up through April, 2020. Results: Results show no significant excess mortality in March or April, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak affected Japan most. Discussion and Conclusion: Because changes in application rule of the International Classification of Diseases in 2017 affected the number of pneumonia deaths drastically, we were unable to use pneumonia deaths to estimate excess mortality. it might be important to continue to monitor excess mortality of COVID-19 carefully after May 2020.","Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Sugishita, Y.; Ohkusa, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20143164v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20143164v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
21,Identifying SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors through drug repurposing screens of SARS- S and MERS-S pseudotyped particles,"While vaccine development will hopefully quell the global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, small molecule drugs that can effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Here inhibitors of two coronavirus spike proteins (S) were identified by screening a library of approved drugs with SARS-S and MERS-S pseudotyped particle entry assays. Using high-throughput screening technology, we discovered three compounds (cepharanthine, abemaciclib and trimipramine) to be broad spectrum inhibitors for spike-mediated entry.

22,Transmission dynamics and control measures of COVID-19 outbreak in China: a modelling study,"COVID-19 is reported to have been effectively brought under control in China at its initial start place. To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we combine a mathematical modelling with multiple datasets to estimate its transmissibility and severity and how it was affected by the unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 29th January 2020, the ascertainment rate is 6.9%(95%CI: 3.5 - 14.6%); then it increased to 41.5%(95%CI: 30.6 - 65.1%). The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.23(95%CI: 1.86 - 3.22) before 8th February 2020; then it dropped to 0.04(95%CI: 0.01 - 0.10). This estimation also indicates that the effect on transmissibility of control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 emerged about two weeks late. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 4.41%(95%CI: 3.65 - 5.30%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from the undetected infected people. This implies that the successful control in China was achieved through decreasing the contact rates among people in general populations and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infected cases.","Zhang, X.; Vynnycky, E.; Charlett, A.; de Angelis, D.; Chen, Z.; Liu, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150086v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150086v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
23,The diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid point-of-care tests for human coronavirus: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many recent studies reported coronavirus point of care tests (POCTs) based on isothermal amplification. However, the performances of these tests have not been systematically evaluated. We searched databases for studies that provide data to calculate sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). We included 43 studies on 5204 specimens. Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Most studies (n = 21) used reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Summary estimated ln(DOR) for RT-LAMP of RNA purified COVID-19 samples is 6.50 (95%CI 5.25-7.76), similar to the previously reported value for RT-LAMP of other RNA virus. RT-LAMP from crude samples has significantly lower ln(DOR) at 4.46 (95%CI 3.53-5.38). SAMBA-II has the highest ln(DOR) at 8.00 (95%CI 6.14-9.87). Abbott ID Now performance is similar to RT-LAMP of crude sample. The performances of CRISPR diagnosis and RT-LAMP are not significantly different. Types of coronaviruses and publication status have no significant effect on diagnosis performance. Existing nucleic acid POCTs, particularly RT-LAMP, CRISPR diagnosis and SAMBA-II, have good diagnostic performance. Future work should focus on improving a study design to minimize the risk of biases.","Subsoontorn, P.; Lohitnavy, M.; Kongkaew, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150235v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150235v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
24,Magnitude and time-course of excess mortality during COVID-19 outbreak: population-based empirical evidence from highly impacted provinces in northern Italy,"Background: The real impact of SARS-CoV-2 on overall mortality remains uncertain and surveillance reports attributed to COVID-19 a limited amount of deaths during the outbreak. Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.","Conti, S.; Ferrara, P.; Mazzaglia, G.; D'Orso, M.

26,"Clinical utility of targeted SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to aid the diagnosis and management of suspected missed, late or post-COVID-19 infection syndromes: results from a pilot service","Objectives: Determine indications and clinical utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing in adults and children. Design: Prospective evaluation of initial three weeks of a daily Monday to Friday pilot SARS-CoV-2 serology service for patients. Setting: Early post 'first-wave' SARS-CoV-2 transmission period at single centre London teaching hospital that provides care to the local community, as well as regional and national referral pathways for specialist services. Participants: 110 (72 adults, 38 children, age range 0-83 years, 52.7% female (n=58)). Interventions: Patient serum from vetted referrals tested on CE marked and internally validated lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with result and clinical interpretation provided to the direct care team. Main outcome measures: Performance characteristics, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly the benefit for clinical decision-making. Results: The LFIA was deemed suitable for clinical advice and decision making following evaluation with 310 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients and 300 pre-pandemic samples, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. For the pilot, 115 referrals were received leading to 113 tests performed on 108 participants (sample not available for two participants); paediatrics (n=35), medicine (n=69), surgery (n=2) and general practice (n=2). 43.4% participants (n=49) had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There were three main indications for serology; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 infection e.g. PIMS-TS (n=26) and pulmonary embolism (n=5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent compatible illness (n=40), and making infection control and immunosuppression treatment decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n=6). Conclusions: This study shows acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of a SARS-CoV-2 serology service using a rapid, inexpensive and portable assay for adults and children presenting with a range of clinical indications. Results correlated closely with a confirmatory in-house ELISA. The study showed the benefit of introducing a serology service where there is a reasonable pre-test probability, and the result can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience thus far is that the volume of requests from hospital referral routes are manageable within existing clinical and laboratory services; however, the demand from community referrals has not yet been assessed. Given recent evidence for a rapid decline in antibodies, particularly following mild infection, there is likely a limited window of opportunity to realise the benefit of serology testing for individuals infected during the 'first-wave' before they potentially fall below a measurable threshold. Rapidly expanding availability of serology services for NHS patients will also help understand the long-term implications of serostatus and prior infection in different patient groups, particularly before emergence of any 'second-wave' outbreak or introduction of a vaccination programme.","Sweeney, N.; Merrick, B.; Pickering, S.; Pedro Galao, R.; Botgros, A.; Wilson, H.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera from recovered COVID-19 patients using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) at low (PRNT50) and high (PRNT90) stringency thresholds. We found that neutralizing activity increased with time post symptom onset (PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having neutralizing titers of at least 160 was ~93% (PRNT50) and ~54% (PRNT90).

In the present study, we have firstly compared two serologic tests on serum samples collected at two different time points from forty-six laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects. Secondly, eighty-five negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8 and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively.

29,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England during May 2020: REACT study,"Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results.

30,The 4C Initiative (Clinical Care for Cardiovascular disease in the COVID-19 pandemic): monitoring the indirect impact of the coronavirus pandemic on services for cardiovascular diseases in the UK,"Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affects cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) directly through infection and indirectly through health service reorganisation and public health policy. Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.","CVD-COVID-UK Consortium,; Ball, S.; Banerjee, A.; Berry, C.; Boyle, J.; Bray, B.; Bradlow, W.; Chaudhry, A.; Crawley, R.; Danesh, J.; Denniston, A.; Falter, F.; Figueroa, J.; Hall, C.; Hemingway, H.; Jefferson, E.; Johnson, T.; King, G.; Lee, K.; McKean, P.; Mason, S.; Mills, N.; Pearson, E.; Pirmohamed, M.; Poon, M.

31,Modeling and Preparedness: The Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Outbreak in Provinces of Ecuador,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan of China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease has become a pandemic in just a few months and spread globally with more than 2.89 million cases and 203,000 deaths across 185 countries, as of April 26th, 2020. Ecuador has reported one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, with more than 10K cases and 500 deaths in a country of approximately 17 million people. The dynamics of the outbreak is being observed quite different in different provinces of Ecuador with high reported prevalence in some low population density provinces. In this study, we aim to understand variations in outbreaks between provinces and provide assistance in essential preparedness planning in order to respond effectively to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The study estimated the critical level of quarantine rate along with corresponding leakage in order to avoid overwhelming the local health care system. The results suggest that provinces with high population density can avoid a large disease burden provided they initiate early and stricter quarantine measures even under low isolation rate. To best of our knowledge, this study is first from the region to determine which provinces will need much preparation for current outbreak in fall and which might need more help.","Bustamante Orellana, C.

32,ReCoNet: Multi-level Preprocessing of Chest X-rays for COVID-19 Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Life-threatening COVID-19 detection from radiomic features has become a dire need of the present time for infection control and socio-economic crisis management around the world. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively. The immense potential of ReCoNet may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle income countries where RT-PCR labs and/or kits are in a serious crisis.","Ahmed, S.; Yap, M.

33,What cost decisiveness? A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 in India,"On 24th March, 2020 the Government of India announced a national level lockdown to contain the spread of COVID. The lockdown policy has generated considerable controversy, with critics arguing that it was done without adequate notice or planning, exposed vulnerable section of the population to a humanitarian crisis, and failed to contain the spread of COVID. In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios. Our estimates reveal the net benefits of lockdown to be negative; moreover, the results are robust under all scenarios.","Dutta, M.; Husain, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148338v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148338v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
34,Bibliometric Analysis of COVID-19 in the Context of Migration Health: A Study Protocol,"Introduction: Human mobility has been pivotal to the spread of COVID-19 through travel and migration.To mitigate the spread, most countries have imposed strict travel restrictions that have severely affected both the wellbeing and livelihoods of many migrant and mobile populations (both internally and internationally), particularly those from impoverished communities, those affected by humanitarian crises, including populations displaced and/or living in camps and camp-like settings. The need to include migrants (both regular and irregular or undocumented) in national strategic response plans for disease prevention and control has been increasingly recognized. Better understanding of the existing scientific evidence in migration health is crucial in designing effective response measures. In this paper, we present a protocol for a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. Expected study findings aim to provide valuable information to support evidence mapping on COVID-19 and migration health, particularly the identification of important research gaps. Methods and analysis: Using Elseviers Scopus abstract and citation database, a comprehensive search strategy will be applied to map scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. The current analysis will focus on research published from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. The search query on migration health will largely focus on migration, migrant and human mobility-related terms. Three reviewers will screen publications for eligibility. The extracted bibliographic information will be analysed to determine the dominant research themes, country coverage and migrant groups. Collaboration networks will be analysed using VosViewer, a network analysis software. A deep dive on dominant research themes or migrant health-related topics will be done by creating visualization network maps of keywords from the retrieved publications.","Pernitez-Agan, S.; Bautista, M.

35,"Negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quantitative parameters, quality, and circadian alignment: Implications for psychological well-being and emotional regulation","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, affecting millions of people and exposing them to home quarantine, isolation, and social distancing. While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality. Online interventions including self-help sleep programs, stress management, relaxation practices, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training are available interventions in the current situation.","Salehinejad, M.

36,Pre-diagnostic circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 and risk of COVID-19 mortality: results from UK Biobank,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deteriorates suddenly primarily due to excessive inflammatory injury, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is implicated in endocrine control of the immune system. However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Further studies are required to determine whether and how targeting IGF-1 pathway might improve COVID-19 prognosis.","Fan, X.; Yin, C.; Wang, J.; Yang, M.; Ma, H.; Jin, G.; Song, M.; Hu, Z.; Shen, H.; Hang, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149369v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149369v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
37,Undocumented infectives in the Covid-19 pandemic,"Background. A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. Its mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.","Melis, M.; Littera, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149682v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149682v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
38,Lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: A rapid study of nine countries,"Lockdown measures have been introduced worldwide to contain the transmission of COVID-19. This paper defines the term lockdown and describes the design, timing and implementation of lockdown in nine countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It also discusses the manner in which lockdown is enforced, the need to mitigate the harms of lockdown, and the association between lockdown and the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While there are some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown, a more notable finding is the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures across the nine countries. We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms. This paper highlights the need for inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary research capable of providing a rigorous and holistic assessment of the harms and benefits of lockdown.","Haider, N.; Osman, A.

39,Characteristics and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in healthcare workers at a London teaching hospital,"Background Healthcare worker (HCW) associated COVID-19 is of global concern due to the potential for nosocomial spread and depletion of staff numbers. However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. Aim To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. Methods Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft ExcelTM. Findings COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Conclusion These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.

40,COVID-19 causing HELLP-like syndrome in pregnancy and role of angiogenic factors for differential diagnosis,"Importance: The clinical presentation of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome is one of the more severe forms of preeclampsia. COVID-19 infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery. Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia. Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7. Conclusion: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy. Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

41,SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction using magnetic beads for rapid large-scale testing by RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP,"Rapid large-scale testing is essential for controlling the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and alternative, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric RT-LAMP using N primers, as well as RT-qPCR using E gene primers showing that the here presented RNA extraction protocol can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput.

43,COVID-19 severity is predicted by earlier evidence of accelerated aging,"With no known treatments or vaccine, COVID-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. The age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type II diabetes. While it is unclear why these diseases predispose risk, we hypothesize that increased biological age, rather than chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity with age. To test this hypothesis, we applied our previously validated biological age measure (PhenoAge) composed of chronological age and nine clinical chemistry biomarkers to data of 347,751 participants from a large community cohort in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank), recruited between 2006 and 2010. Other data included disease diagnoses (to 2017), mortality data (to 2020), and the UK national COVID-19 test results (to May 31, 2020). Accelerated aging 10-14 years prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with test positivity (OR=1.15 per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.21, p=3.2x10-6) and all-cause mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=1.25, per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.44, p=0.002) after adjustment for demographics including current chronological age and pre-existing diseases or conditions. The corresponding areas under the curves were 0.669 and 0.803, respectively. Biological aging, as captured by PhenoAge, is a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than chronological age, and may inform risk stratification initiatives, while also elucidating possible underlying mechanisms, particularly those related to inflammaging.","Kuo, C.-L.; Pilling, L.

45,Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.","Seow, J.; Graham, C.; Merrick, B.; Acors, S.; Steel, K.

46,In vivo demonstration of microvascular thrombosis in severe Covid-19,Several autopsies studies showed the presence of microthrombi in the pulmonary circulation of the severe COVID-19. The major limitation of these investigations is that the autopsy provided static information. Some of these alterations could be secondary to the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) observed as the final common pathway of the multisystem organ failure exhibited in the critical patient. We report the preliminary results of an in vivo evaluation of the sublingual microcirculation in thirteen patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at the beginning of the hospitalization. They did not have any laboratorial DIC evidence. We observed multiple filling defects moving within the sublingual microvessels indicative of microthrombi in 11 (85%) patients.

47,Antibody dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19 patients,"Humoral immunity in asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well established. 63 healthy contacts, 63 asymptomatic individuals, and 51 mild patients were enrolled in this study and screened using nucleic acid testing (NAT) and commercial kits of serum IgM and IgG antibodies against recombinant nucleoprotein (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and mild patients were classified into at least four types based on NAT and serological tests, especially 81% and 25.4% negative NAT but positive IgM/IgG responses, respectively. Antibody dynamics were further demonstrated by IgM and IgG profile responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteome. IgM antibody responses against S1 were elicited in asymptomatic individuals as early to the seventh day after exposure and peaked on days from 17d to 25d, which might be used as early diagnostic biomarkers. Moreover, asymptomatic individuals evoked weaker S1 specific IgM and neutralizing antibody responses than mild patients. Most importantly, S1 specific IgM/IgG responses and the titers of neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic individuals gradually vanished in two months. Our findings might have important implications for serological survey, public health and immunization strategy.","Lei, Q.; Li, Y.; Hou, H.; Wang, F.; Zhang, Y.; Lai, D.; Jo-Lewis, B.

48,In-house modification and improvement of the CDC real-time PCR diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"The world is currently facing an unprecedented pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which was first reported in late 2019 by China to the World Health Organization (WHO). The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies/l for both nCoV 2019_N1/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies/l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","Das, S.; Dowell-Martino, C.; Arrigo, L.; Fiedler, P.

49,"Using simulation to assess the potential effectiveness of implementing screening at national borders during international outbreaks of influenza, SARS, Ebola virus disease and COVID-19","The effectiveness of screening travellers for signs of infection during times of international disease outbreak is contentious, especially as the reduction of the risk of disease importation can be very small. Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers. We compare our results to those already in the published literature.","Bays, D.; Bennett, E.; Finnie, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150664v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150664v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
50,Decreased serum levels of inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with clinical response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients,"Background. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. At least in western countries, the most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases. In this regard, we proposed that COVID-19 severity may be tightly related to inflammaging, i.e. the age-related onset of inflammation, which is responsible for age-related diseases. It has been reported that systemic hyper-inflammation may turn to be detrimental in COVID-19 patients. Objective. Here, we exploited a recently closed clinical trial (NCT04315480) on the anti-IL-6 drug tocilizumab to assess whether microRNAs regulating inflammaging can be assessed as biomarkers of drug response and outcome. Methods. Serum levels of miR-146a-5p, -21-5p, and -126-3p were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR by two independent laboratories on 30 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19, characterized by multifocal interstitial pneumonia confirmed by CT-scan and requiring oxygen therapy, and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. COVID-19 patients were treated with a single-dose intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab and categorized into responders and non-responders. Results. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to tocilizumab have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p=0.007). Moreover, among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p=0.008). Conclusion. Our data show that blood-based biomarkers, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide a molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to enlarge the drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","Sabbatinelli, J.; Giuliani, A.; Matacchione, G.; Latini, S.; Laprovitera, N.; Pomponio, G.; Ferrarini, A.; Svegliati Baroni, S.; Pavani, M.; Moretti, M.; Gabrielli, A.; Procopio, A.

51,Commercial Serology Assays Predict Neutralization Activity Against SARS-CoV-2,"Background. Currently it is unknown whether a positive serology results correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. Methods. A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and the levels of neutralizing antibodies detected was correlated. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. Results. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a PPA of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a NPA of 98.0% across 100 negative controls. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrates they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. Conclusions. For the first time, we demonstrate that three widely available clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. When a two-platform screen and confirm approach was used for SARS-CoV-2 serology, nearly 80% of two-platform positive specimens had neutralization titers (ID50 >50).","Suhandynata, R. T.; Hoffman, M.

52,Genetic associations for two biological age measures point to distinct aging phenotypes,"Biological age measures outperform chronological age in predicting various aging outcomes, yet little is known regarding genetic predisposition. We performed genome-wide association scans of two age-adjusted biological age measures (PhenoAgeAcceleration and BioAgeAcceleration), estimated from clinical biochemistry markers1,2 in European-descent participants from UK Biobank. The strongest signals were found in the APOE gene, tagged by the two major protein-coding SNPs, PhenoAgeAccel-rs429358 (APOE e4 determinant) (p=1.50 x 10-72); BioAgeAccel-rs7412 (APOE e2 determinant) (p=3.16 x 10-60). Interestingly, we observed inverse APOE e2 and e4 associations and unique pathway enrichments when comparing the two biological age measures. Genes associated with BioAgeAccel were enriched in lipid related pathways, while genes associated with PhenoAgeAccel showed enrichment for immune system, cell function, and carbohydrate homeostasis pathways, suggesting the two measures capture different aging domains. Our study reaffirms that aging patterns are heterogenous across individuals, and the manner in which a person ages may be partly attributed to genetic predisposition.","Kuo, C.-L.; Pilling, L.

This study offers an exhaustive analysis of the reproductive number (R0) in India with major intervention for COVID-19 outbreaks and analysed the lockdown effects on the Covid-19. Methodology: Covid-19 data extracted from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline.

54,Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration and Loading Variability from Grab and 24-Hour Composite Samples,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires a significant, coordinated public health response. Assessing case density and spread of infection is critical and relies largely on clinical testing data. However, clinical testing suffers from known limitations, including test availability and a bias towards enumerating only symptomatic individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained widespread support as a potential complement to clinical testing for assessing COVID-19 infections at the community scale. The efficacy of WBE hinges on the ability to accurately characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. To date, a variety of sampling schemes have been used without consensus around the appropriateness of grab or composite sampling. Here we address a key WBE knowledge gap by examining the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater grab samples collected every 2 hours for 72 hours compared with corresponding 24-hour flow-weighted composite samples. Results show relatively low variability (mean for all assays = 741 copies 100 mL-1, standard deviation = 508 copies 100 mL-1) for grab sample concentrations, and good agreement between most grab samples and their respective composite (mean deviation from composite = 159 copies 100 mL-1). When SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are used to calculate viral load, the discrepancy between grabs (log10 difference = 12.0) or a grab and its associated composite (log10 difference = 11.8) are amplified. A similar effect is seen when estimating carrier prevalence in a catchment population with median estimates based on grabs ranging 62-1853 carriers. Findings suggest that grab samples may be sufficient to characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, but additional calculations using these data may be sensitive to grab sample variability and warrant the use of flow-weighted composite sampling. These data inform future WBE work by helping determine the most appropriate sampling scheme and facilitate sharing of datasets between studies via consistent methodology.","Curtis, K.; Keeling, D.; Yetka, K.; Larson, A.; Gonzalez, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150607v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150607v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True

57,Diagnostic value of skin manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease. The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","Bataille, V.; Visconti, A.; Rossi, N.; Murray, B.; Bournot, A.; Wolf, J.; Ourselin, S.; Steves, C.; Spector, T.; Falchi, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150656v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150656v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
58,The Age Pattern of the Male- to- Female Ratio in Mortality from COVID-19 Mirrors that of Cardiovascular Disease but not Cancer in the General Population,"Background: Males are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex) ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in the general population. Methods: We obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in middle-to-high income countries. Findings: In both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European countries. Interpretation: The sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.","Nimgaonkar, I.; Valeri, L.; Susser, E.

Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors. Comorbidities may warrant careful attention as would COVID-19 exposure levels.","Burhan, E.; Syam, A. F.; Rahyussalim, A. J.; Prasenohadi, P.; Wulung, N. G. L.; Susanto, A. D.; Sajinadiyasa, I. G.

62,A drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis C antivirals as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be ∼2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ∼6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found ∼50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate &lt;0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 ≤ 50 μM. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 μM), Ciluprevir (20.77μM). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10μM), and Telaprevir (15.25μM). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Jeremy D Baker; Rikki L Uhrich; Gerald C Kraemer; Jason E Love; Brian C Kraemer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
63,A Strategy to Treat COVID-19 Disease with Targeted Delivery of Inhalable Liposomal Hydroxychloroquine: A Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic Study,"ABSTRACTSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 µg/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 µg/g (Cmax) in the lung. Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with normalized dose showed higher (∼30-fold) lung exposure, longer (∼2.5-fold) half-life in lung, but lower blood exposure with ∼20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics results in an animal model demonstrate the proof of concept that inhalable liposomal HCQ may provide clinical benefit and serve as a potential treatment for COVID-19.View Full Text",Tien-Tzu Tai; Tzung-Ju Wu; Huey-Dong Wu; Yi-Chen Tsai; Hui-Ting Wang; An-Min Wang; Sheue-Fang Shih; Yee-Chun Chen,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196618v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196618v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
64,Discovery of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection using a phenotypic screening strategy and network-analysis to predict their potential to treat covid-19,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.Summary sentence Discovery of drug repurposing candidates, inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, using a phenotypic screening strategy and network analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Douglas  Ferreira Sales-Medina; Ludmila Rodrigues Pinto Ferreira; Lavinia M.

65,"Inactivation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by specimen transport media, nucleic acid extraction reagents, detergents and fixatives","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid multi-faceted response by the scientific community, bringing researchers, health officials and industry together to address the ongoing public health emergency. To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens.View Full Text",Stephen Welch; Katherine Davies; Hubert Buczkowski; Nipunadi Hettiarachchi; Nicole Green; Ulrike Arnold; Matthew Jones; Matthew J Hannah; Reah Evans; Christopher Burton; Jane E Burton; Malcolm Guiver; Patricia A Cane; Neil Woodford; Christine B Bruce; Allen D.G Roberts; Marian J Killip,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.194613v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.194613v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
66,A Holistic Approach to Identification of Covid-19 Patients from Chest X-Ray Images utilizing Transfer Based Learning,"Novel coronavirus likewise called COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now outspread over the world. Around 8 millions of individuals previously got influenced by novel coronavirus and it causes at any rate 500,000 deaths. There are just about 90,000 individuals contaminated by COVID-19 in Bangladesh too. As it is an exceptionally new pandemic infection, its diagnosis is challenging for the medical community. In regular cases, it is hard for lower incoming countries to test cases easily. RT-PCR test is the most generally utilized analysis framework for COVID-19 patient detection. However, by utilizing X-ray image based programmed recognition can diminish the expense and testing time. So according to handling this test, it is important to program and effective recognition to forestall transmission to others. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish COVID-19 patients by chest X-ray images. We execute different pre-trained deep neural system models, for example, Sequential, DenseNet121, ResNet152 and EfficientNetB4 to assess the most productive outcome. And aims to utilize transfer-based learning. We assess this outcome by AUC, where EfficientNetB4 has 0.997 AUC, ResNet50 has 0.967 AUC, DenseNet121 has 0.874 AUC and the Sequential model has 0.762 AUC individually. And EfficientNetB4 has achieved 98.86% accuracy.","Rafi, T.

67,"Clinical, Behavioral and Social Factors Associated with Racial Disparities in Hospitalized and Ambulatory COVID-19 Patients from an Integrated Health Care System in Georgia","Introduction: Racial and ethnic minorities have shouldered a disproportioned burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection to date in the US, but data on the various drivers of these disparities is limited. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients and explore factors associated with hospitalization risk by race. Methods: Case series of 448 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), an integrated health care system serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, from March 3 to May 12, 2020. KPGA members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Multivariable analyses for hospitalization risk also included an additional 3489 persons under investigation (PUI) with suspected infection. COVID-19 treatment and outcomes, underlying comorbidities and quality of care management metrics, socio-demographic and other individual and community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. Results: Of 448 COVID-19 positive members, 68,3% was non-Hispanic Black (n=306), 18% non-Hispanic White (n=81) and 13,7% Other race (n=61). Median age was 54 [IQR 43-63) years. Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups. Beyond well-known physiologic and clinical factors, individual and community-level social indicators and health behaviors must be considered as interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 disparities and the systemic effects of racism are implemented.","Lobelo, F.; Bienvenida, A.

68,Molecular analysis of binding region of an ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 between humans and mammals,"In June 2020, a second wave of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infections raised concern in Beijing, where salmon sold a fresh fish wholesale market was suspected of being the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. It has raised questions in the press and elsewhere about the scientific basis of salmon as a source of infection. With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed. However, a non-high structural homology of ACE2 between salmon and humans was observed. Further experiments are needed to find the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the salmon.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",Takuma Hayashi; Kaoru Abiko; Masaki Mandai; Ikuo Konishi; Nobuo Yaegashi,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196378v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196378v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
69,IL-33 expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 correlates with seropositivity in COVID-19 convalescent individuals,"Our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still developing. We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist- activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33- producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV- 2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","Stanczak, M. A.; Sanin, D.

70,Validation and comparison of PICTURE analytic and Epic Deterioration Index for COVID-19,"Introduction The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented strain on healthcare facilities across the United States. Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. Methods The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results PICTURE successfully delineated between high- and low-risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 - 0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 - 0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 - 0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 - 0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 - 0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 - 0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 - 0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). Conclusion The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","Cummings, B. C.; Ansari, S.; Motyka, J. R.; Wang, G.; Medlin, R. P.; Kronick, S.

72,Robust three-dimensional expansion of human adult alveolar stem cells and SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of a present global pandemic, infects human lung alveolar cells (hACs). Characterising the pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hACs limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and the application of long-term 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Jeonghwan Youk; Taewoo Kim; Kelly V.

73,Comprehensive in-vivo secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals novel regulatory motifs and mechanisms,"SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes COVID-19, a disease that has triggered a major human health and economic crisis. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementA patent application on MarathonRT has been filed by Yale University.View Full Text",Nicholas C Huston; Han Wan; Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares; Craig B Wilen; Anna Marie Pyle,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197079v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197079v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
74,Stabilizing the Closed SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer,"The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and development efforts. Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the protein’s stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation.

75,Genomic Mutations and Changes in Protein Secondary Structure and Solvent Accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Virus),"ABSTRACTSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Thanh Thi Nguyen; Pubudu N.

76,"D614G Spike Variant Does Not Alter IgG, IgM, or IgA Spike Seroassay Performance","Emergence of a new variant of spike protein (D614G) with increased infectivity and transmissibility has prompted many to analyze the potential role of this variant in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants. This is an important finding both for SARS-CoV-2 disease biology and for potential antibody-based therapeutics.","Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Hicks, J.; Mehalko, J.; Drew, M.; Memoli, M.

77,Genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat: Underlying role of variants in disease epidemiology,"Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and &gt;18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat are forming distinct cluster under GH clade of GISAID.View Full Text",Madhvi Joshi; Apurvasinh C Puvar; Dinesh Kumar; Afzal Ansari; Maharshi Pandya; Janvi Raval; Zarna Patel; Pinal Trivedi; Monica Gandhi; Labdhi Pandya; Komal Patel; Nitin Savaliya; Snehal Bagatharia; Sachin Kumar; Chaitanya Joshi,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197095v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197095v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
78,Discriminating Mild from Critical COVID-19 by Innate and Adaptive Immune Single-cell Profiling of Bronchoalveolar Lavages,"ABSTRACTHow innate and adaptive lung immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 synchronize during COVID-19 pneumonitis and regulate disease severity is poorly established. To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically ‘controlled’ fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by ‘orderly’ phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity. Our work represents a major resource for understanding the lung-localised immunity and inflammation landscape during COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Els Wauters; Pierre Van Mol; Abhishek D.

79,Severely ill COVID-19 patients display augmented functional properties in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells,"ABSTRACTThe molecular properties of CD8+ T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known. Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of &gt;80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was ‘exhausted’ or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the non-exhausted subsets from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-κB signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects displayed polyfunctional features. Cells with such features were mostly absent in SARS-CoV-2 responsive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our single-cell analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8+ T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Anthony Kusnadi; Ciro Ramírez-Suástegui; Vicente Fajardo; Serena J Chee; Benjamin J Meckiff; Hayley Simon; Emanuela Pelosi; Grégory Seumois; Ferhat Ay; Pandurangan Vijayanand; Christian H Ottensmeier,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.194027v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.194027v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
80,Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector protects against SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis,"SUMMARYSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of human infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Accordingly, an effective vaccine is of critical importance in mitigating coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) and curtailing the pandemic. We developed a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine by introducing a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene in place of the native glycoprotein gene (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2). Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung indicating protection against pneumonia. Finally, passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals protects naïve mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These data support development of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 as an attenuated, replication-competent vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementM.S.D. is a consultant for Inbios, Eli Lilly, Vir Biotechnology, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, and on the Scientific Advisory Board of Moderna.

81,Which animals are at risk? Predicting species susceptibility to Covid-19,"In only a few months, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leaving physicians, scientists, and public health officials racing to understand, treat, and contain this zoonotic disease. SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for environmental and public health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Matthew R Alexander; Clara T.

82,SARS-CoV-2 induces activation and diversification of human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells.,"Several studies have analyzed antiviral immune pathways in severe COVID-19 patients. However, the initial steps of antiviral immunity are not known. Here, we have studied the interaction of isolated primary SARS-CoV-2 viral strains with human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC), a key player in antiviral immunity. We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-α, interferon-λ1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon-α and inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that pDC may represent a major player in the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and call for caution in the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early treatment of the disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Fanny Onodi; Lucie Bonnet-Madin; Léa Karpf; Laurent Meertens; Justine Poirot; Jerôme LeGoff; Constance Delaugerre; Ali AMARA; Vassili Soumelis,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197343v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197343v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
83,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of human ACE2 transgenic mice causes severe inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and compromised respiratory function","ABSTRACTSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has spread worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.Competing Interest StatementM.

This current poses great challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Objective: To make a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients. Methods: HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5 Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics, laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) , and other indicators between the two groups. Conclusions: Faced with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), HD patients with lower BMI and hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition.

Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. This is essential for defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.","Fenizia, C.; Biasin, M.; Cetin, I.; Vergani, P.; Mileto, D.; Spinillo, A.; Gismondo, M.

Here we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","Carrigan, N.; Wearn, A.

87,Predictors of Anxiety Regarding The COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-care Workers in a Hospital Not Assigned to Manage COVID-19 Patients in Nepal.,"Introduction: We studied the levels and severity of anxiety caused by COVID-19 amongst frontline health-care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care neurological hospital in Nepal, not assigned to manage COVID-19 cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 frontline Health Care Workers (HCWs) using a 10-point subjective assessment tool, the Anxiety Level Index (ALI), and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS), to assess the level of anxiety regarding COVID-19. Results: On ALI 55% of HCWs were found to have marked severe anxiety (6-9), however, on SAS 44% of HCWs reported anxiety. The majority HCWs were female (n=78) with nurses forming 62% of the sample size. The mean age was 26.8 years (SD 8.17). Factors associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19 on ALI were age (p=0.002), sex (p=0.001), receiving regular COVID-19 updates via social media (p=0.011) and a high frequency of checking for COVID-19 information authenticity (p=0.039). Work experience (p=0.026) and frequency of checking for information authenticity (p=0.029) were factors found to increase SAS measured anxiety and were found to be associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that respondents with work experience of less than or equal to 2 years were 0.380 (95% CI 0.158 to 0.910) times less likely to have anxiety than those with work experience of more than 2 years. Similarly, the odds of having anxiety among those who checked information authenticity less frequently was 0.377 (95% CI 0.153 to 0.931) times less than those who often did. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a substantial impact on the mental health of frontline HCWs in a hospital not assigned to manage COVID-19 patients. Length of time of worked in healthcare and the frequency of checking for COVID-19-related information were significant predictors of anxiety.","Thapa, L.; Ghimire, A.; Ghimire, S.; Sharma, N.; Shrestha, S.; Devkota, M.; Bhattarai, S.; Maharjan, A.; Lohani, S.; Phuyal, S.; Maharjan, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148866v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148866v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
88,SARS-CoV-2 spread across the Colombian-Venezuelan border,"Venezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Venezuelan ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns.

89,"Adolescents' health literacy, health protective measures, and health-related quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic","Purpose: First, to describe adolescents' health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.","Riiser, K.; Helseth, S.; Haraldstad, K.; Torbjornsen, A.; Richardsen, K.

90,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Parturient Women,"Limited data are available for pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests are critically important to determine exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 within both individuals and populations. We completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing of 1,293 parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from April 4 to June 3, 2020. We tested 834 pre-pandemic samples collected in 2019 and 15 samples from COVID-19 recovered donors to validate our assay, which has a ~1% false positive rate. We found 80/1,293 (6.2%) of parturient women possessed IgG and/or IgM SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race/ethnicity differences in seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can potentially be used to estimate seroprevalence within the community.","Flannery, D.

91,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests with different antigen targets,"Background These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests. Methods In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response, and that anti-nucleocapside (anti-N) antibodies appeared earlier than the anti-spike (anti-S) proteins. Conclusions The identified SARS-CoV-2 serology tests may be used for the diagnostic of CoviD-19 for negative RT-PCR patients presenting severe to mild suggestive symptoms or particular clinical presentation. Detection of both anti-N and anti-S could be complementary to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.","Coste, A.

92,A Poorly Understood Disease? The Unequal Distribution of Excess Mortality Due to COVID-19 Across French Municipalities,"While COVID-19 was already responsible for more than 500,000 deaths worldwide as of July 3, 2020, very little is known on the socio-economic heterogeneity of its impact on mortality. In this paper, we combine several administrative data sources to estimate the relationship between mortality due to COVID-19 and poverty at a very local level (i.e. the municipality level) in France, one of the most severely hit country in the world. We find strong evidence of an income gradient in the impact of the pandemic on mortality: it is twice as large in the poorest municipalities compared to other municipalities. We then show that both poor housing conditions and higher occupational exposure are likely mechanisms. Overall, these mechanisms accounts for up to 60% of the difference observed between rich and poor municipalities.","Brandily, P.; Brebion, C.; Briole, S.; Khoury, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149955v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149955v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
93,The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19,"SARS-CoV2 infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever and organ dysfunction and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, is more similar to Kawasaki disease, but also differ from this with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests endoglin, an endothelial glycoprotein as one of several candidate targets of autoantibodies in MIS-C.","Rosat Consiglio, C.; Cotugno, N.; Sardh, F.; Pou, C.; Amodio, D.; Zicari, S.; Ruggiero, A.; Rubens Pascucci, G.; Rodriguez, L.; Santilli, V.; Tan, Z.; Eriksson, D.; Wang, J.; Lakshmikanth, T.; Marchesi, A.; Lakshmikanth, T.; Campana, A.; Villani, A.; Rossi, P.; the CACTUS study team,; Landegren, N.; Palma, P.; Brodin, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148353v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148353v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True

African and Afro-Caribbean children constituted about 47% of the cases in these reports. Despite the fact that glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common among this population, the G6PD status of these cases has not been reported in these reports. We reported the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19 from Saudi Arabia. This case was a Saudi G6PD deficient girl who died with PMIS related to COVID-19. G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance and exaggerates the inflammatory response; thus, it might contribute to the development or the grave outcome of our case. We urgently need to assess the association between G6PD deficiency and COVID-19 in a large study as the G6PD deficiency may be a useful predictor for the progression of the COVID-19.","Al-Aamri, M.

95,Disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in African Americans correlates with dynamic segregation,"Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","Bassolas, A.; Sousa, S.; Nicosia, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148742v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148742v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
96,Recurrent Neural Reinforcement Learning for Counterfactual Evaluation of Public Health Interventions on the Spread of Covid-19 in the world,"As the Covid-19 pandemic soars around the world, there is urgent need to forecast the expected number of cases worldwide and the length of the pandemic before receding and implement public health interventions for significantly stopping the spread of Covid-19. Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies. We applied the developed methods to real data collected from January 22, 2020 to June 28, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. We forecasted that the number of laboratory confirmed cumulative cases of Covid-19 will pass 26 million as of August 14, 2020.","Ge, Q.; Hu, Z.; Zhang, K.; Li, S.; Lin, W.; Jin, L.; Xiong, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149146v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149146v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True

This study systematically examines care-home outbreaks of COVID-19 in a large Scottish health board. Methods: Analysis of testing, cases and deaths using linked care-home, testing and mortality data for 189 care-homes with 5843 beds in a large Scottish Health Board up to 15/06/20. Findings: 70 (37.0%) of care-homes experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, 66 of which were in care-homes for older people where care-home size was strongly associated with outbreaks (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94). There were 852 confirmed cases and 419 COVID-related deaths, 401 (95.7%) of which occurred in care-homes with an outbreak, 16 (3.8%) in hospital, and two in the 119 care-homes without a known outbreak. For non-COVID related deaths, there were 73 excess deaths in care-homes with an outbreak, but no excess deaths in care-homes without an outbreak, and 24 fewer deaths than expected of care-home residents in hospital. A quarter of COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred in five (2.6%) care-homes, and half in 13 (6.9%) care-homes. Interpretation: The large impact on excess deaths appears to be primarily a direct effect of COVID-19, with cases and deaths are concentrated in a minority of care homes. A key implication is that there is a large pool of susceptible residents if community COVID-19 incidence increases again. Shielding residents from potential sources of infection and rapid action into minimise outbreak size where infection is introduced will be critical in any wave 2.

98,A case-control and cohort study to determine the relationship between ethnic background and severe COVID-19,"Background. People of minority ethnic background may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19 for reasons that are unclear. We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.","Zakeri, R.; Bendayan, R.; Ashworth, M.; Bean, D.

A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries.

103,Repeat SARS-CoV-2 Testing Models for Residential College Populations,"Residential colleges are considering re-opening under uncertain futures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to rapidly detect and isolate new infections as they occur to block transmission that would otherwise occur on campus and, of arguably greater importance, off. The models allow for the evolution of test sensitivity with time from infection, scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, imported infections from off campus throughout the school year, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of greatly increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.","Chang, J.

104,Severe SAR-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting indysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 10 million people worldwide with mortality exceeding half a million patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age,hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Clear mechanistic understanding of how these comorbidities converge to enable severe infection is lacking. Notably each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome and this disruption may be a unifying feature of severe COVID-19. Here we provide the first in depth interrogation of lipidomic changes, including structural-lipids as well as the eicosanoids and docosanoids lipid mediators (LMs), that mark COVID-19 disease severity. Our data reveal that progression from moderate to severe disease is marked by a loss of specific immune regulatory LMs and increased pro-inflammatory species.

105,Disentangling Increased Testing From Covid-19 Epidemic Spread,"To design effective disease control strategies, it is critical to understand the incidence of diseases. In the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States (caused by outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus), testing capacity was initially very limited and has been increasing at the same time as the virus has been spreading. When estimating the incidence, it can be difficult to distinguish whether increased numbers of positive tests stem from increases in the spread of the virus or increases in testing. This has made it very difficult to identify locations in which the epidemic poses the largest public health risks. Here, we use a probabilistic model to quantify beliefs about testing strategies and understand implications regarding incidence. We apply this model to estimate the incidence in each state of the United States, and find that: (1) the Covid-19 epidemic is likely to be more widespread than reported by limited testing, (2) the Covid-19 epidemic growth in the summer months is likely smaller than it was during the spring months, and (3) the regions which are at highest risk of Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks are not always those with the largest number of positive test results.","Lengerich, B.

106,Performance characteristics of a high throughput automated transcription mediated amplification test for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"The COVID19 pandemic caused by the new SARSCoV2 coronavirus has imposed severe challenges on laboratories in their effort to achieve sufficient diagnostic testing capability for identifying infected individuals. In this study we report the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of a new, high throughput, fully automated nucleic acid amplification test system for the detection of SARSCoV2. The assay utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and acridinium ester labeled probe chemistry on the automated Panther System to directly amplify and detect two separate target sequences in the ORF1ab region of the SARSCoV2 RNA genome. The probit 95% limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 0.004 TCID50/ml using inactivated virus, and 25 c/ml using synthetic in vitro transcript RNA targets. Analytical sensitivity (100% detection) was confirmed to be 83 to 194 c/ml using three commercially available SARSCoV2 nucleic acid controls. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with testing six related human coronaviruses, as well as 24 other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, at high titer. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen testing (N=140) showed 100%, 98.7%, and 99.3% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively, with a validated reverse transcription PCR NAAT for SARSCoV2 RNA. These results provide validation evidence for a sensitive and specific method for pandemic-scale automated molecular diagnostic testing for SARSCoV2.","Pham, J.; Meyer, S.; Nguyen, C.; Williams, A.; Hunsicker, M.; McHardy, I.; Gendlina, I.; Goldstein, D.

107,Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (ai-LAMP) for Rapid and Reliable Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"Until vaccines and effective therapeutics become available, the practical way to transit safely out of the current lockdown may include the implementation of an effective testing, tracing and tracking system. However, this requires a reliable and clinically validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific identification of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. The system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.","Rohaim, M.

108,Natural killer cell activation related to clinical outcome of COVID-19,"Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important for deciphering mechanisms of host responses and interpreting disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation-landscape in COVID-19 disease.","Maucourant, C.; Filipovic, I.; Ponzetta, A.; Aleman, S.; Cornillet, M.; Hertwig, L.; Strunz, B.; Lentini, A.; Reinius, B.; Brownlie, D.; Cuapio Gomez, A.; Heggernes Ask, E.; Hull, R.

109,Clinical characteristics and outcomes in diabetes patients admitted with COVID-19 in Dubai: a cross-sectional single centre study.,"Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia. Laboratory data Mean(SD) on admission for those who needed ward-based care versus those needing intensive care unit (ICU) care: Fibrinogen 462.75 (125.16) mg/dl vs 660 (187.58) mg/dl ; D-dimer 0.66 (0.55) mcg/ml vs 2.3 (3.48) mcg/ml; Ferritin 358.08 (442.05) mg/dl vs 1762.38 (2586.38) mg/dl; and CRP 33.9 (38.62) mg/L vs 137 (111.72) mg/L were all statistically significantly higher for the ICU cohort (p<0.05). Average length of stay in hospital was 14.55 days. 28.2% of patients needed ICU admission. 4.9% (n=5) overall died during hospitalisation (all in ICU). Conclusions: In this single-centre study in Dubai, 25% of patients admitted with COVID-19 also had diabetes/prediabetes. Most diabetes patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease were males of Asian origin. 14.6% had new diagnosis of diabetes/prediabetes on admission. The majority of patients with diabetes/prediabetes and COVID-19 infection had other important comorbidities (n=76; 73.8%). Only 4 patients had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR but had pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that are associated with poor prognosis: Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP levels were all statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) at presentation in patients who subsequently needed ICU care compared with those patients who remained ward-based. 28.2% overall needed ICU admission, out of which 5 patients died. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","Bhatti, R.; Omer, A.; Khattib, S.; Shiraz, S.; Matfin, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149096v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149096v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
110,"Distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA","Evidence-based public health approaches that minimize the introduction and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters are urgently needed in the United States and other countries struggling with expanding epidemics. Here we analyze 247 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA, and find surprisingly distinct patterns of viral spread. Dane County had the 12th known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, but this did not lead to descendant community spread. Instead, the Dane County outbreak was seeded by multiple later introductions, followed by limited community spread. In contrast, relatively few introductions in Milwaukee County led to extensive community spread. We present evidence for reduced viral spread in both counties, and limited viral transmission between counties, following the statewide Safer-at-Home public health order, which went into effect 25 March 2020. Our results suggest that early containment efforts suppressed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within Wisconsin.","Moreno, G. K.; Braun, K. M.; Riemersma, K. K.; Martin, M. A.; Halfmann, P. J.; Crooks, C.

111,Event-specific interventions to minimize COVID-19 transmission,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with over 11 million cases worldwide. Currently there is no treatment and no vaccine. Interventions such as hand washing, masks, social distancing, and ""social bubbles"" are used to limit community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of ""event R"", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Tupper, P.; Yerlanov, M.; Boury, H.; Colijn, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
112,High levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with restricted functionality in patients with severe course of COVID-19,"Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 differ in the severity of disease. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells and antibodies were characterized in patients with different COVID-19 related disease severity. Despite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells as compared to convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cells dominated over CD8 T-cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA- and IgG-levels. Unlike in convalescents, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in patients with severe disease showed marked alterations in phenotypical and functional properties, which also extended to CD4 and CD8 T-cells in general. Given the strong induction of specific immunity to control viral replication in patients with severe disease, the functionally altered phenotype may result from the need for contraction of specific and general immunity to counteract excessive immunopathology in the lung.","Schub, D.; Klemis, V.; Schneitler, S.; Mihm, J.; Lepper, P.

113,Dual nature of human ACE2 glycosylation in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike,"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Ahmad Reza Mehdipour; Gerhard Hummer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,False
114,Predictive Analysis for COVID-19 Spread in India by Adaptive Compartmental Model,"The role of mathematical modelling in predicting spread of an epidemic is of vital importance. The purpose of present study is to develop and apply a computational tool for predicting evolution of different epidemiological variables for COVID-19 in India. We propose a dynamic SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for this purpose. In the dynamic model, time dependent infection rate is assumed for estimating evolution of different variables of the model. Parameter estimation of the model is the first step of the analysis which is performed by least square optimization of priori data. In the second step of the analysis, simulation is carried out by using evaluated parameters for prediction of the outbreak. The computational model has been validated against real data for COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Time to reach peak, peak infected cases and total reported cases were compared with actual data and found to be in very good agreement. Next the model is applied for the case of India and various Indian states to predict different epidemiological parameters. Priori data was taken from the beginning of nation-wide lockdown on 24 March to 6 July. It was found that peak of the outbreak may reach in the month of August-September with maximum 4-5 lakhs active cases at peak. Total number of reported cases all over India would be in between three to five millions. State wise, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu and Delhi would be worst affected.","Singh, S.

115,Decline of humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in convalescent individuals,"ABSTRACTIn the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Guillaume Beaudoin-Bussières; Annemarie Laumaea; Sai Priya Anand; Jérémie Prévost; Romain Gasser; Guillaume Goyette; Halima Medjahed; Josée Perreault; Tony Tremblay; Antoine Lewin; Laurie Gokool; Chantal Morrisseau; Philippe Bégin; Cécile Tremblay; Valérie Martel-Laferrière; Daniel E.

116,Human B cell clonal expansion and convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,"SUMMARYDuring virus infection B cells are critical for the production of antibodies and protective immunity. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped naïve responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19 patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the presence of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-binding domain. These findings offer molecular insights into shared features of human B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic spillover coronaviruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Sandra C.

117,Molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 9-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The in situ architecture of the ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. These characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to an unprecedented resolution, and shed lights on how the virus packs its ~30 Kb long single-segmented RNA in the ~80 nm diameter lumen.

119,Digestive Manifestations in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"Background: The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in COVID-19 remain uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death.

120,Structures of potent and convergent neutralizing antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike unveil a unique epitope responsible for exceptional potency,"SummaryUnderstanding the mechanism of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for effective vaccines and therapeutics development. We recently reported an exceptionally potent NAb, BD-368-2, and revealed the existence of VH3-53/VH3-66 convergent NAbs in COVID-19. Here we report the 3.5-Å cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2’s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer. Unlike VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 binding by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their “up” and “down” positions. BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape. Together, these results rationalize a unique epitope that leads to exceptional neutralization potency, and provide guidance for NAb therapeutics and vaccine designs against SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementX.S.X and Y.C are inventors on the patent applications of the NAbs.View Full Text",Shuo Du; Yunlong Cao; Qinyu Zhu; Guopeng Wang; Xiaoxia Du; Runsheng He; Hua Xu; Yinghui Zheng; Bo Wang; Yali Bai; Chenggong Ji; Ayijiang Yisimayi; Qisheng Wang; Ning Gao; X.

121,Epidemiological model for the inhomogeneous spatial spreading of COVID-19 and other diseases,"We suggest a mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to the COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume fast mixing of the population relative to the local infection rate, similar to the regime applicable to many chemical reactions. However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a ``reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localizes areas.","Tsori, Y.; Granek, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148767v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148767v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,True
122,"Comprehensive variant and haplotype landscapes of 50,500 global SARS-CoV-2 isolates and accelerating accumulation of country-private variant profiles","Understanding the genetic etiology of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive understanding of the variant and haplotype landscape of all reported genomes of SARS-COV-2, the causative virus of the disease. Country-, state/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently.Evidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May.In summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Lishuang Shen; Jennifer Dien Bard; Jaclyn A.

123,Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases,"Background Little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases.Methods and findings We explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative.Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet, and could survive for several days.

124,Screening and testing for a suitable untransfected cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies,"At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.Author summary In the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.View Full Text",Claudia Pommerenke; Ulfert Rand; Cord C.

125,A single-dose live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidate,"The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines to quench the unrestrained spread of SARS-CoV-2. Several promising vaccine platforms, developed in recent years, are leveraged for a rapid emergency response to COVID-191. We employed the live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as a vector to express the prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. In mice, the vaccine candidate, tentatively named YF-S0, induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and a favorable Th1 cell-mediated immune response. In a stringent hamster SARS-CoV-2 challenge model2, vaccine candidate YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals even within 10 days. These results warrant further development of YF-S0 as a potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Lorena Sanchez Felipe; Thomas Vercruysse; Sapna Sharma; Ji Ma; Viktor Lemmens; Dominique van Looveren; Mahadesh Prasad Arkalagud Javarappa; Robbert Boudewijns; Bert Malengier-Devlies; Suzanne F.

126,Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and fatal respiratory disease,"ABSTRACTThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created an international health crisis. Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Joseph W.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19.

Methods Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission, and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method/random effects model and converted to Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. Results Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR=1.75), neutrophil count (OR=2.62), D-dimer (OR=3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR=1.82), fibrinogen (OR=3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.60), procalcitonin (OR=4.76), IL-6 (OR=2.10), and IL-10 (OR=4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision tree model (sensitivity=100%, specificity=81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74 x109/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR=5.21), neutrophils (OR=6.25), D-dimer (OR=4.19), and prolonged PT (OR=2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR=13.87), CRP (OR=7.09), D-dimer (OR=6.36), and neutrophils (OR=6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality.

Here, we report the filtration efficiency, dipole charge density, and fiber integrity of pristine N95 and KN95 respirators before and after various decontamination methods. We found that the filter layer of N95 is 8-fold thicker than that of KN95, which explains its 10% higher filtration efficiency (97.03 %) versus KN95 (87.76 %) under pristines condition. After 60 minutes of 70 {degrees}C treatment, the filtration efficiency and dipole charge density of N95 became 97.16% and 12.48 {micro}C/m2, while those of KN95 were 83.64% and 1.48 {micro}C/m2 ; moreover, fit factor of N95 was 55 and that of KN95 was 2.7.

132,Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Specific CD4(+) and CD8 (+) T Cell Responses Using MHC Class I and II Tetramers,"The success of SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) vaccines is measured by their ability to mount immune memory responses that are long-lasting. To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitch™ platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types. With the peptide exchange generated MHC tetramers, scientists can assess CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes. Results obtained with several SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I and II peptides are included and discussed.Competing Interest StatementThis work is covered by 2 patent applications one by MCD and another by MCD and YP.

133,"Air recirculation role in the infection with COVID-19, lessons learned from Diamond Princess cruise ship","Objectives: The Diamond Princess cruise ship is a unique case because it is the place at which testing capacity has reached its highest rate in the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analysing data that are collected about the current COVID-19 outbreak onboard, and by considering the design of the air conditioning system of the ship and virus transmission modes on cruise ships, this study aims to raise the hypothesis regarding the role of poor ventilation systems in the spread of COVID-19. Design: This is an analysis of count data that has been collected by the onboard clinic up to the 20th February 2020. Symptomatic infection rates during the quarantine period in cabins with previous confirmed cases are compared to these in cabins without previous confirmed cases. Results: Symptomatic infection rate during the quarantine period in cabins with previously confirmed cases is not significantly higher than that in cabins without previously confirmed cases. Age does not appear to be a cofounder. Conclusions: Airborne transmission of COVID-19 through the ventilation system onboard could explain the virus spread into cabins during the quarantine period.","Almilaji, O.; Thomas, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148775v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148775v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,True
134,In vivo structural characterization of the whole SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome identifies host cell target proteins vulnerable to re-purposed drugs,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Lei Sun; Pan Li; Xiaohui Ju; Jian Rao; Wenze Huang; Shaojun Zhang; Tuanlin Xiong; Kui Xu; Xiaolin Zhou; Lili Ren; Qiang Ding; Jianwei Wang; Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
135,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces germinal center responses with robust stimulation of CD4 T follicular helper cells in rhesus macaques,"ABSTRACTCD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important for the generation of long-lasting and specific humoral protection against viral infections. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.Competing Interest StatementA.S. is listed as inventors on a provisional patent application covering findings reported in this manuscript.

136,Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated-transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapeutic development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",James Chen; Brandon Malone; Eliza Llewellyn; Michael Grasso; Patrick M.

137,Extracellular vesicles containing ACE2 efficiently prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-containing virus,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 entry is mediated by binding of the spike protein (S) to the surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent priming by TMPRRS2 allowing membrane fusion. Here, we produced extracellular vesicles (EVs) exposing ACE2 and demonstrate that ACE2-EVs are efficient decoys for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-containing lentivirus. Reduction of infectivity positively correlates with the level of ACE2, is 500 to 1500 times more efficient than with soluble ACE2 and further enhanced by the inclusion of TMPRSS2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Federico Cocozza; Ester Piovesana; Nathalie Névo; Xavier Lahaye; Julian Buchrieser; Olivier Schwartz; Nicolas Manel; Mercedes Tkach; Clotilde Théry; Lorena Martin-Jaular,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193672v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193672v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
138,Towards the design of multiepitope-based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis. This multiepitope-based peptide vaccine may represent a potential candidate against coronavirus 2. However, further in vitro and in vivo verification are required.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Hasanain Abdulhameed Odhar; Salam Waheed Ahjel; Suhad Sami Humadi,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.186122v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.186122v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
139,Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations,"Aim The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.Methods An extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants’ at these genes with ±1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/).Results A total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Leire Moya; Samaneh Farashi; Prashanth N Suravajhala; Panchadsaram Janaththani; Jyotsna Batra,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.179028v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.179028v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
140,Continuous flexibility analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike prefusion structures,"With the help of novel processing workflows and algorithms, we have obtained a better understanding of the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion state. We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Roberto Melero; Carlos Oscar S.

141,SARS-CoV-2 sample-to-answer nucleic acid testing in a tertiary care emergency department: evaluation and utility,"Rapid sample-to-answer tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging and data on their relative performance is urgently needed. We evaluated the analytical performance of two rapid nucleic acid tests, Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Mobidiag Novodiag(R) Covid-19, in comparison to a combination reference of three large-scale PCR tests. Moreover, utility of the Novodiag(R) test in tertiary care emergency departments was assessed. In the preliminary evaluation, analysis of 90 respiratory samples resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for Xpert(R), whereas analysis of 107 samples resulted in 93.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Novodiag(R). Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing with Novodiag(R) was made available for four tertiary care emergency departments in Helsinki, Finland between 18 and 31 May, coinciding with a rapidly declining epidemic phase. Altogether 361 respiratory specimens, together with relevant clinical data, were analyzed with Novodiag(R) and reference tests: 355/361 of the specimens were negative with both methods, and 1/361 was positive in Novodiag(R) and negative by the reference method. Of the 5 remaining specimens, two were negative with Novodiag(R), but positive with the reference method with late Ct values. On average, a test result using Novodiag(R) was available nearly 8 hours earlier than that obtained with the large-scale PCR tests. While the performance of novel sample-to-answer PCR tests need to be carefully evaluated, they may provide timely and reliable results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 and thus facilitate patient management including effective cohorting.","Jokela, P.; Jääskeläinen, A.

142,COVID-19 Mortality Risk Assessment: An International Multi-Center Study,"Background: Timely identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality can significantly improve patient management and resource allocation within hospitals. This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. Findings: The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ([&le;] 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([&ge;] 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen ([&ge;] 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine ([&ge;] 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. Interpretation: The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","Bertsimas, D.; Lukin, G.; Mingardi, L.; Nohadani, O.; Orfanoudaki, A.; Stellato, B.; Wiberg, H.; Cisneros-Herreros, J.

However, in countries with high rates of coronavirus disease, children with the syndrome COVID-19 associated inflammation syndrome referred to as PIMS-TS have been reported. Similarities noted between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences and those of other super antigens has prompted the suggestion that this might be the mechanism by SARS-CoV-ST triggers PIMS-TS. It has also been suggested that the D614G variant found more commonly in the US and across European countries may explain why PIMS-TS appears to be common in these countries. Here we analysed viral sequences from 13 paediatric COVID-19 patients of whom five were diagnosed with PIMS-TS. This is the first characterisation of viruses from PIMS-TS patients. In contrast to what has been hypothesised, we found no evidence of unique sequences associated with the viruses from PIMS-TS patients.","Pang, J.; Boshier, F. A.

144,Reflection of connectivism in medical education and learning motivation 4 during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected the global healthcare and economy but threatened the world of education altogether. Malaysia is not spared from this pandemic as all universities were forced to close and initiate online learning with the implementation of Movement Control Order since mid-March 2020.The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning definitely deserves a reflection on how it affects the learning motivation among medical students. Hence, this is the first study that compares the effect of digital learning on learning motivation among medical students in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A modified Students Motivation towards Science Learning (SMTSL) was used to assess the learning motivation of UKM medical students throughout Year 1-5. The number of students that use digital learning during COVID-19 is significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 (p<0.05). However, there is no significant difference (p=0.872) in learning motivation among medical students before and during COVID-19 crisis. Higher frequency in digital learning usage frequency does not exert a great impact on learning motivation. Reflections from each participant were collated to justify the current situation. This could be due to motivation coming from the very choice to pursue medicine as a doctor, which is mainly influenced by intrinsic motivation, and ability to adapt in difficult situations. Thus, medical educators should be creative in enhancing extrinsic motivation by making use of digital learning as a platform so that medical students are able to independently fish for information in the vast pool of digital information and apply in actual medical practice in the future for life-long learning.","Ismail, N.

146,Artificial intelligence driven assessment of routinely collected healthcare data is an effective screening test for COVID-19 in patients presenting to hospital,"The early clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be difficult to distinguish from other undifferentiated medical presentations to hospital, however viral specific real- time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has limited sensitivity and can take up to 48 hours for operational reasons. In this study, we develop two early-detection models to identify COVID-19 using routinely collected data typically available within one hour (laboratory tests, blood gas and vital signs) during 115,394 emergency presentations and 72,310 admissions to hospital. Our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (AUROC 0.939) for COVID- 19 amongst all patients attending hospital, and Admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset admitted to hospital. Both models achieve high negative predictive values (>99%) across a range of prevalences (<5%), facilitating rapid exclusion during triage to guide infection control. We prospectively validated our models across all patients presenting and admitted to a large UK teaching hospital group in a two-week test period, achieving 92.3% (n= 3,326, NPV: 97.6%, AUROC: 0.881) and 92.5% accuracy (n=1,715, NPV: 97.7%, AUROC: 0.871) in comparison to RT-PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improves apparent accuracy (95.1% and 94.1%) and NPV (99.0% and 98.5%). Our artificial intelligence models perform effectively as a screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments and hospital admission units, offering high impact in settings where rapid testing is unavailable.","Soltan, A.

Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 11 COVID-19 patients. Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 2,600 samples derived from 11 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19.

Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg /kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+/-}2.75 versus 13.22 {+/-}.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82). No adverse events were observed Conclusions : Add-on use of IVM to HCQ and AZT had better effectiveness, shorter hospital stay, and relatively safe compared with controls. however, a larger prospective study with longer follow up may be needed to validate these results.","Gorial, F.

149,Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence Amidst Community-Acquired Respiratory Viruses,"Background. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 as new cause of severe viral pneumonia (CoVID-19) reaching Europe by late January 2020. We validated the WHO-recommended assay and describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs). Methods. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 individuals were prospectively tested by the Basel-S-gene and the WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 together with SARS-CoV-2. Results. Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) positive samples. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 NOPS. Adults were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while children were more likely to test CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced other CARVs within 3 weeks reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhino/enterovirus (13%), influenzavirus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial (6%) and metapneumovirus (6%). Conclusions. The differential diagnosis for respiratory infections was broad during the early pandemic, affecting infection control and treatment decisions. We discuss the role of pre-existing immunity and competitive CARV replication for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults and children.","Leuzinger, K.; Roloff, T.; Gosert, R.; Soegaard, K.; Naegele, K.; Rentsch, K.; Bingisser, R.; Nickel, C.; Pargger, H.; Bassetti, S.; Bielicki, J.

150,Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were often implemented under considerable uncertainty and a lack of scientific evidence. Assessing the effectiveness of the individual interventions is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 4,579 NPIs implemented in 76 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We use a hierarchically coded data set of NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques, which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs strongly varies across countries and world regions, and in relation to human and economic development as well as different dimensions of governance. We quantify the effectiveness of each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption, i.e., how early into the epidemics. The emerging picture is one in which no one-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI alone can decrease Rt below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns that are also highly effective, such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system. By allowing to simulate ``what-if'' scenarios at the country level, our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs.","Haug, N.; Geyrhofer, L.; Londei, A.; Dervic, E.; Desvars-Larrive, A.; Loreto, V.; Pinior, B.; Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
151,Reconstructing the global dynamics of under-ascertained COVID-19 cases and infections,"Background: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= to 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as an assumed baseline. We then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: We estimate that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. Despite low case detection in some countries, our results that adjust for this still suggest that all countries have had only a small fraction of their populations infected as of July 2020. Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","Golding, N.; Russell, T.

152,Modeling reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospital burden achieved by prioritizing testing using a clinical prediction rule,"Prompt identification of cases is critical for slowing the spread of COVID-19. However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. 'flattens the curve'), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden. In conclusion, we present a novel approach to evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity, to achieve public health goals for COVID-19.","Reimer, J. R.; Ahmed, S.

153,Novel SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and neutralization assays reveal wide range of humoral immune response during COVID-19,"Development of antibody protection during SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) infection is a pressing question for public health and for vaccine development. We developed highly sensitive CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralization assays. CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n=87) and were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which was also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Further, subjects who donated plasma further out from the diagnosis of COVID-19 appeared to have lower titers. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also contained NAbs against SARS Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","Dogan, M.; Kozhaya, L.; Placek, L.; Gunter, C.; Yigit, M.; Hardy, R.; Plassmeyer, M.; Coatney, P.; Lillard, K.; Bukhari, Z.; Kleinberg, M.; Hayes, C.; Arditi, M.; Klapper, E.; Merin, N.; Liang, B.

154,Joint Detection of Serum IgM/IgG Antibody is An Important Key to Clinical Diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 Infection,"Background: This study was aimed to investigate the application of SARS- COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67/68). Conclusion: Combined detection of serum SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies had better sensitivity compared with single IgM or IgG test, which can be used as an important diagnostic tool for SARS-COV-2 infection and a screening tool of potential SARS-COV-2 carriers in clinics, hospitals and accredited scientific laboratory.","Hu, F.; Shang, X.; Chen, M.; Zhang, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20146902v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20146902v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
155,Atypical Presentations of COVID-19 in Care Home Residents presenting to Secondary Care: A UK Single Centre Study,"Background: The United Kingdom (UK) care home population has experienced high mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium. Individuals presenting atypically, especially with anorexia, have higher mortality.","Rawle, M.

To create a repeatable modelling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability, readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable datasets were compiled, and linear regression models were built during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in states with high population densities, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania showing the strongest predictive results.

Setting: Dutch hospitals Patients: Patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19. Interventions: Pharmacokinetic sampling Measurements: The plasma concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine and QTc time. Main Results: A total of 83 patients were included. The median (IQR) plasma concentration chloroquine during treatment was 1.05 mol/L (0.63 - 1.55 mol/L). None of the patients reached exposure exceeding the concentration to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by 90% (IC90) of 6.9 M. Furthermore, {Delta}QTc >60 milliseconds occurred after initiation of chloroquine treatment in 34% patients and during treatment QTc [&ge;]500 milliseconds was observed in 46% of patients. Conclusions: Recommended dose chloroquine treatment results in plasma concentrations that are unlikely to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, the incidence of QTc prolongation was high. The preclinical promise of chloroquine as antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19 is overshadowed by its cardiac toxicity and lack of effective exposure. It is unlikely that a positive clinical effect will be found with chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.","Bruggemann, R. J. M.; Moes, D. J. A. R.; van Rhee, K. p.; van 't Veer, N. E.; Koch, B. C.

Genomic surveillance showed 9 introductions of three distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based analyses yielded an R0 estimate of 10 4.4 (95% confidence interval: 2.0-7.7), suggesting intense spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. RT-PCR-based tests 11 were highly sensitive but showed variation of internal controls and between diagnostic targets. Commercially available 12 SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs showed up to 25% false-positive results depending on antigen and antibody types, likely due 13 to unspecific antibody responses elicited by acute malaria according to lack of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing 14 antibody responses and relatively higher parasitemia in those sera. 15 We confirm an overload of the diagnostic capacity in Benin and provide baseline information on the usability of 16 genome-based surveillance in resource-limited settings.

159,Risk of Transmission of infection to Healthcare Workers delivering Supportive Care for Coronavirus Pneumonia;A Rapid GRADE Review,"Abstract Background: Avenues of treatment currently implemented for Covid-19 pandemic are largely supportive in nature. Non -availability of an effective antiviral treatment makes supportive care for acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the most crucial intervention. Highly contagious nature of Covid-19 had created stress and confusion among front line Health Care Workers (HCWs) regarding infectious risk of supportive interventions and best preventive strategies. Purpose: To analyze and summarize key evidence from published literature exploring the risk of transmission of Covid-19 related to common supportive care interventions in hospitalized patients and effectiveness of currently used preventive measures in hospital setting. Data Sources: Curated Covid-19 literature from NCBI Computational Biology Branch ,Embase and Ovid till May 20,2020.Longitudinal and reference search till June 28,2020 Study Selection: Studies pertaining to risk of infection to HCWs providing standard supportive care of hospitalized Covid-19 mainly focusing on respiratory support interventions.Indirect studies from SARS,MERS or other ARDS pathology caused by infectious agents based on reference tracking and snow ball search . Clinical, Healthy volunteer and mechanistic studies were included. Two authors independently screened studies for traditional respiratory supportive-care (Hypoxia management, ventilatory support and pulmonary toileting) related transmission of viral or bacterial pneumonia to HCWs. Data Extraction: Two authors (TK and SP) independently screened articles and verified for consensus. Quality of studies and level of evidence was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) , Newcastle - Ottawa quality assessment Scale for observational studies and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence. Data Synthesis: 21 studies were eligible for inclusion. In 11 mechanistic studies, 7 were manikin based,1 was in the setting of GNB pneumonia ,2 were healthy volunteer study and 1 was heterogenous setting.Out of 10 clinical studies ,5 were case controlled and 6 were cohort studies. Risk of corona virus transmission was significantly high in HCWs performing or assisting endotracheal intubation or contact with respiratory secretion.(Moderate certainty evidence, GRADE B) Safety of nebulization treatment in corona virus pneumonia patients are questionable(Low certainty evidence, GRADE C).Very low certainty evidence exist for risk of transmission with conventional HFNC (GRADE D) and NIV (GRADE D),CPR (GRADE D),Bag and mask ventilation(GRADE D).Moderate certainty evidence exist for protective effect of wearing a multilayered mask, gown , eye protection and formal training for PPE use (GRADE B).Low certainty evidence exist for transmission risk with bag and mask ventilation, suctioning before and after intubation and prolonged exposure (GRADE C).Certainty of evidence for wearing gloves,post exposure hand washing and wearing N 95 mask is low(GRADE C). Limitations: This study was limited to articles with English abstract. Highly dynamic nature of body of literature related to Covid-19, frequent updates were necessary even during preparation of manuscript and longitudinal search was continued even after finalizing initial search. Due to the heterogeneity and broad nature of the search protocol, quantitative comparisons regarding the effectiveness of included management strategies could not be performed. Direct evidence was limited due to poor quality and non-comparative nature of available Covid-19 reporting. Conclusions: Major risk factors for transmission of corona virus infection were, performing or assisting endotracheal intubation and contact with respiratory secretion. Risk of transmission with HFNC or NIV can be significantly decreased by helmet interface, modified exhalation circuit or placing a properly fitting face mask over patient interface of HFNC. Evidence for risk of transmission with CPR, suctioning before or after intubation or bag and mask ventilation of very low certainty. Significant protective factors are Formal training for PPE use, consistently wearing mask, gown and eye protection.

160,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Rates of Children in Louisiana During the State Stay at Home Order.,"Children (less than 19 years) account for 20% of the US population but currently represent less than 2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Because infected children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in children is poorly understood. METHODS During the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood samples from 812 individuals from a Childrens Hospital were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical records were compared with local COVID-19 cases. RESULTS In total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11 years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test. Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish. CONCLUSION In a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location, race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported and may have contributed to virus transmission.","Dietrich, M. L.; Norton, E.

And in response to emerging pathogens of pandemic potential, public health policies must be both dynamic and adaptive. Yet, this process of policy change and adaptation remains opaque. Accordingly, this rapid systematic review will synthesise and analyse evaluative policy literature to develop a roadmap of policy changes that have occurred after each pandemic event, throughout both the 20th and 21st Century, in order to better inform future policy development. Methods and Analysis A rapid systematic review will be conducted to assimilate and synthesise both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature that document the then current pandemic preparedness policy, and the subsequent changes to that policy, across high-, middle- and low-income countries. The rapid review will follow the PRISMA guidelines, and the literature search will be performed across five relevant databases, as well as various government websites to scan for grey literature. Articles will be screen against pre-agreed inclusion/ exclusion criteria, and data will be extracted using a pre-defined charting table. Ethics and Dissemination All data rely on secondary, publicly available data sources; therefore no ethical clearance is required. Upon completion, the results of this study will be disseminated via the Imperial College London Community and published in an open access, peer-reviewed journal.","Lowry, E.; Taddese, H.; Bowman, L.

162,The benefits of peer transparency in safe workplace operation post pandemic lockdown,"The benefits, both in terms of productivity and public health, are investigated for different levels of engagement with the test, trace and isolate procedures in the context of a pandemic in which there is little or no herd immunity. Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a ""playable model"" in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in maximising productivity and minimising overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed on how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","Wey, A.; Champneys, A.

163,"An Agent Based Modeling of COVID-19: Validation, Analysis, and Recommendations","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Countries have adopted Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an Agent Based Model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The Agent Based Model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of daily confirmed cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford county, Kansas, USA. Different interventions including contact tracing are applied on a scaled down version of New York city, USA and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with a city-wide lock-down results in the effective reproduction number (Rt) to fall below 1 within three weeks of intervention. In the case of 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated and the spread is contained within three months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lock-down can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lock-down can go a long way to contain the spread. No particular funding was available for this project.","Shamil, M. S.; Farheen, F.; Ibtehaz, N.; Khan, I. M.; Rahman, M.

164,Forcing Seasonality of influenza-like epidemics with daily Solar resonance,"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","Nicastro, F.; Sironi, G.; Antonello, E.; Bianco, A.; Biasin, M.; Brucato, J.

165,Optimally Pooled Viral Testing,"It has long been known that pooling samples may be used to minimize the total number of tests required in order to identify each infected individual in a population. Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection probability, but remains better than non-pooled testing up to an infection probability of 30%. The present predictions imply that optimal pooling may be used to extremely efficiently test populations with infection percentages down to 0.1%, in which case a single round of optimal pooling with an average of as few as 6 tests may be sufficient to uniquely identify every infected individual in a population of 100 (and increases to 20 tests when at 1% infection). Additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooled testing, thus reducing the average number of tests required to test a population with 1% infection from 20 to 14 out of 100 (and from 6 to 4 with 0.1% infections). These best case predictions, obtained assuming perfect test accuracy and specificity, provide a quantitative measure of the optimal pool size and expected testing efficiency gains in populations with infection probabilities ranging from 0.1% to 30%, and are supported by recent COVID-19 detection sensitivity and optimized pool size experiments.","Ben-Amotz, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
166,"A national cross-sectional survey of public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Efforts to mitigate the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have largely relied on broad compliance with public health recommendations, yet navigating the high volume of evolving information and misinformation related to SARS-CoV-2 can be challenging. We assessed national public perceptions (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) related to COVID-19 in Canada to understand public perspectives and inform future public health initiatives. Methods: We administered a national online survey with the goal of obtaining responses from 2000 adults residing in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize respondent characteristics and tested for significant overall regional differences using chi-squared tests and t-tests, as appropriate. Results: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% either self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified regional differences in perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion: We found that knowledge about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Parsons Leigh, J.; Fiest, K.; Brundin-Mather, R.; Plonikoff, K.; Soo, A.; Sypes, E.

167,Ultrametric model for covid-19 dynamics: an attempt to explain slow approaching herd immunity in Sweden,"We present a mathematical model of infection dynamics that might explain slower approaching the herd immunity during the covid-19 epidemy in Sweden than it was predicted by a variety of other models; see graphs Fig. 2. The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchy's levels) barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This model's feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19 epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of ""super-spreaders"" who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection. In future, this model will be completed by adding the SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19 spreading.","Khrennikov, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146209v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146209v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
168,The COVID-19 mortality effects of underlying health conditions in India: a modelling study,"Objective: To model how known COVID-19 comorbidities will affect mortality rates and the age distribution of mortality in a large lower middle income country (India), as compared with a high income country (England), and to identify which health conditions drive any differences. Design: Modelling study. Setting: England and India. Participants: 1,375,548 respondents aged 18 to 99 to the District Level Household Survey-4 and Annual Health Survey in India. Additional information on health condition prevalence on individuals aged 18 to 99 was obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries Studies (GBD). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportional increase in age-specific mortality in each country due to the prevalence of each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic heart disease, respiratory illness, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer, among others). The combined change in overall mortality and the share of deaths under 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. Results: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs. 8.5%), chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs. 2.5%), and kidney disease (9.7% vs. 5.6%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs. 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs. 5.9%), and cancer (0.3% vs. 2.8%). Population COVID-19 mortality in India relative to England is most increased by diabetes (+5.4%) and chronic respiratory disease (+2.3%), and most reduced by obesity (-9.7%), cancer (-3.2%), and chronic heart disease (-1.9%). Overall, comorbidities lower mortality in India relative to England by 9.7%. Accounting for demographics and population health explains a third of the difference in share of deaths under age 60 between the two countries. Conclusions: Known COVID-19 health risk factors are not expected to have a large effect on aggregate mortality or its age distribution in India relative to England. The high share of COVID-19 deaths from people under 60 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unexplained. Understanding mortality risk associated with health conditions prevalent in LMICs, such as malnutrition and HIV/AIDS, is essential for understanding differential mortality.

169,High excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm Region areas with young and socially vulnerable populations,"Background: We aimed to describe the distribution of excess mortality (EM) during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, according to individual age and sex, and the sociodemographic context Methods: Weekly all-cause mortality data were obtained from Statistics Sweden for the period 01/01/2015 to 17/05/2020. EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2,379,792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+ year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. Findings: An EM was first detected during the week of March 23-29 2020. During the peaking week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 160% was observed: 211% in 80+ year-old women; 179% in 80+ year-old men. During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%), and lowest share of gainfully employed (174%). There was a 1.2 to 1.7-fold increase in EM between those areas with a higher vs. lower proportion of young people. Interpretation: Living in areas with lower socioeconomic status and younger populations is linked to COVID-19 EM. These conditions might have facilitated the viral spread. Our findings add to the well-known biological vulnerability linked to increasing age, the relevance of the sociodemographic context when estimating the individual risk to COVID-19.","Calderon-Larranaga, A.; Vetrano, D.

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify transcriptional changes at the level of the lung epithelium that have the to drive the COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","FitzGerald, E.

173,Favipiravir and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hamster model,"SummaryThere is a need for safe and effective antiviral molecules with which to combat COVID-19 pandemics. Recently, in vitro inhibitory activity of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 was reported. Here, we used a Syrian hamster model to explore the pharmacokinetics of this molecule and its in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed that high doses (700-1400mg/kg/day) significantly reduced virus replication in the lungs accompanied by clinical alleviation of the disease. However, these high doses were associated with significant toxicity in hamsters. Favipiravir pharmacokinetics displayed non-linear increase in plasma exposure between the doses and good lung penetration. Analysis of viral genomes in vivo showed that favipiravir induced a mutagenic effect. Whilst the plasma trough concentrations observed in this study were comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials, this potential toxicity requires further investigation to assess whether a tolerable dosing regimen can be found in humans that effectively reduces virus replication.Competing Interest StatementJeremie Guedj has consulted for F.

174,The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","Tavares, R. d.

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5’ untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Schubert, K.; Karousis, E.

176,A Fluorescence-based High Throughput-Screening assay for the SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (&gt;96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors.

177,The evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within the coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus,"SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2 receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","Wells, H.

178,Alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks by integer linear programming: SARS-CoV-2,"Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","Llabres, M.; Valiente, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
179,Spike protein fusion loop controls SARS-CoV-2 fusogenicity and infectivity,"The Spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We have investigated the Spike from six β-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β-coronavirus MHV-A59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo. The Spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.Summary The Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is the prime mediator of COVID-191 because of its central role in virus-host attachment, virus-entry, and virus-spread2. The contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the Spike glycoprotein3, its high affinity of binding to human ACE2 receptor4, and cleavage5. While these may be imperative, it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity. Here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of SARS-CoV-2 Spike that triggers the virus fusion, distinguishes it from the other five β-coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic, including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides. The fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive β-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β-coronavirus, MHV-A59 studies6. The synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process, which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Pal, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
180,A rapidly adaptable biomaterial vaccine for SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Langellotto, F.; Seiler, B.

181,Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2,"Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, Y.

182,"Genes Encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Related Proteins Mediating SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry are Upregulated with Age in Human Cardiomyocytes","Age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in patients following COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Robinson, E.

183,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression increases with age in patients requiringmechanical ventilation.,"Mortality due to Covid-19 is highly associated with advanced age, owing in large part to severe lower respiratory tract infection. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 2010-2020. Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation. We compared samples across age, ranging from 40-83 years old in the ventilated cohort and 14-80 years old in the non-ventilated cohort. Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II / AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells. In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). Additionally, we observed prominent pulmonary endothelial ACE2 expression in 2 patients on either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly.","Baker, S.

184,The mental health impact of COVID-19 and pandemic related stressors among adults in the UK,"Background: The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a wide range of social and economic changes that could, in turn, have affected the mental health of the UK adult population. Previous research has not been able to measure the broad range of potential stressors, nor examine whether recent changes in those stressors have positively or negatively impacted on common mental disorders. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the stressful impact of the lockdown on mental health has accumulated over time or whether people have adapted to the new conditions of lockdown. This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first few months of lockdown related to the coronavirus pandemic and whether changes in CMD were associated with an increase in stressors related to lockdown and the pandemic. Methods: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (wave 9: 2017-2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 respectively), a representative sample of UK population, were analysed. Common mental disorders (CMD) were measured using the GHQ-12 (cut off >2) at all waves. The difference in the GHQ-12 (using Likert scores) between waves measured changes in psychological well-being. The incidence of CMD and changes in psychological well-being were analysed in relation to pandemic specific stressors and changes in economic, financial, household and psychosocial stressors. Findings: Around 30% of UKHLS adults without CMD in 2017/9 had a CMD in April 2020. However from April to May 2020, the incidence reduced considerably to below 13%. Much of the increase in incident CMD between April and May was associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, but some of this increase was also associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home. The reduction in the incidence of many of these stressors in May (compared to April) coincided with a reduction in the incidence of CMD in May. Conclusion: The pandemic and resultant lockdown were associated with an increase in the incidence of CMD in the UK adult population initially in April 2020. These changes were associated with increases in feelings of loneliness and stressors related to work and domestic life and receipt of care. There was some evidence of adaptation to many of these stressors over the lockdown period by May 2020. However, if levels of unemployment and redundancy increase in the near future, the implications for the mental health of the population need careful thought and monitoring.","Chandola, T.; Kumari, M.; Booker, C.

It covers 401 counties by multivariate spatial models that can take into account regional interrelationships and possible spillover effects. The case and death rates are, for example, significantly positively associated with early cases from the beginning of the epidemic, the average age, the population density and the number of people employed in elderly care. By contrast, they are significantly negatively associated with the density of schoolchildren and infant care as well as the density of doctors. In addition, for individual variables significant spillover effects on the case numbers of neighbouring regions could be identified, which have a different sign than the overall effects and thus give cause for further analyses of the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 infections. The results complement the knowledge about COVID-19 infection beyond the clinical risk factors discussed so far by a socio-economic perspective. The findings can contribute to the targeted derivation of political measures and their review, as is currently being discussed in particular for the tourism and education sectors.","Ehlert, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.20140459v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.20140459v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
186,"Racial segregation, testing sites access, and COVID-19 incidence rate in Massachusetts, USA","The U.S. has merely 4% of the world population but 25% of the world's COVID-19 cases. Massachusetts has been in the leading position of total cases since the outbreak in the U.S. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing sites access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: 1) residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COIVD-19 infections among minority; 2) The Black has the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Asian, and Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of testing location being accessed by all populations; 3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection; 4) Different from previous studies, elderly population rate is not statistically significant with incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hot spot regions of COVID-19 infections. The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts.","Hu, T.; Yue, H.; Wang, C.; She, B.; Ye, X.; Liu, R.; Zhu, X.; Bao, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146787v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146787v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True

188,Rats and the COVID-19 pandemic: Early data on the global emergence of rats in response to social distancing,"Following widespread closures of food-related businesses due to efforts to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities reported increased sightings of rats in close vicinity of people. Because rats vector a number of pathogens transmissible to people, changes in their behavior has consequences for human health risks. To determine the extent of how stay-at-home measures influenced patterns of rat sightings we: 1) examined the number of rat-related public service requests before and during the period of lockdown in New York City (NYC) and Tokyo, Japan; 2) examined reports made in proximity to closed food service establishments in NYC; and 3) surveyed pest control companies in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Poland. During the month following lockdown, the overall number of reports decreased by 30% in NYC, while increasing 24% in Tokyo. However, new hotspots of 311 calls were observed in proximity of closed food service establishments in NYC; and there was a consistent positive association between kernel density estimates of food service establishments and location of 311 calls (r = 0.33 to 0.45). Similarly, more reports were observed in the restaurant-dense eastern side of Tokyo. Changes in clientele for pest control companies varied geographically, with 37% of pest-management companies surveyed in North America reporting 50-100% of their post-lockdown rat-related requests coming from new clients. In Warsaw, where there are no clusters of restaurants in densely-populated areas, there were no changes. In Tokyo, there were no changes in clients. We conclude that changes in public service calls are region-specific and localized, with increases in rat sightings more likely near restaurant-dense regions. Pest control companies surveyed in North America either lost much of their business or shifted clientele from old to new locations. We discuss possible mitigation measures including ramping up pest control during re-opening of food-related establishments and the need for citywide rodent surveillance and disease monitoring.","Parsons, M.

189,Effect of Systemic Inflammatory Response to SARS-CoV-2 on Lopinavir and Hydroxychloroquine Plasma Concentrations,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to inflammatory cytokine release, which can downregulate the expression of metabolizing enzymes. This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung. CRP values significantly correlated with LPV but not HCQ plasma concentrations, implying inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism by inflammation.","Marzolini, C.; Stader, F.; Stoeckle, M.; Franzeck, F.; Egli, A.; Bassetti, S.; Hollinger, A.; Osthoff, M.; Weisser, M.; Gebhard, E.

190,The usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 test positive proportion as a surveillance tool,"Comparison of COVID-19 case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virologic testing confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to under-reporting of incidence, and by variations in testing capacity between locations and over time. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to qualitatively assess the testing capacity of a location; a high TPP could provide evidence that too few people are tested, leading to more under-reporting. In this study we propose a simple model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters in the model, related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. We use simulations to show situations in which the TPP is higher or lower than we expect based on these parameters, and the effect of testing strategies on the TPP. In our simulations, we find in the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between spatial locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. As a corollary, the TPP can be used to distinguish between a decline in confirmed cases due to decline in incidence (in which case TPP should decline) and a decline in confirmed cases due to testing constraints (in which case TPP should remain constant). We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms (test symptomatic proportion, TSP) encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. We suggest that collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can aid interpretation of changes in TPP and increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.","Hitchings, M.

191,Causally Associations of Blood Lipids Levels with COVID-19 Risk: Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). It has been found that coronary artery disease (CAD) is a comorbid condition for COVID-19. As the risk factors of CAD, whether blood lipids levels are causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 is still unknown. Design: We performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to explore whether dyslipidemia, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were causally related to COVID-19 risk and severity. The GWAS summary data of blood lipids involving in 188,578 individuals and dyslipidemia in a total of 53,991 individuals were used as exposures, respectively. Two COVID-19 GWASs including 1,221 infected patients and 1,610 severe patients defined as respiratory failure were employed as outcomes. Based on the MR estimates, we further carried out gene-based and gene-set analysis to explain the potential mechanism for causal effect. Results: The MR results showed that dyslipidemia was casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19 and induced 27% higher odds for COVID-19 infection (MR-IVW OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.49, p-value = 3.18 x 10-3). Moreover, the increasing level of blood TC will raise 14 % higher odds for the susceptibility of COVID-19 (MR-IVW OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.25, p-value = 5.07 x 10-3). Gene-based analysis identified that ABO gene was associated with TC and the gene-set analysis found that immune processes were involved in the risk effect of TC. Conclusions: We obtained three conclusions: 1) Dyslipidemia is casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19; 2) TC is a risk factor for the susceptibility of COVID-19; 3) The different susceptibility of COVID-19 in specific blood group may be partly explained by the TC concentration in diverse ABO blood groups.","Zhang, K.; Guo, Y.; Wang, Z.-X.; Ding, J.-M.; Yao, S.; Chen, H.; Zhu, D.-L.; Zhang, K.; Huang, W.; Dong, S.-S.; Yang, T.-L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147926v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147926v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
192,Estimating the establishment of local transmission and the cryptic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA,"We use a global metapopulation transmission model to study the establishment of sustained and undetected community transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. The model is calibrated on international case importations from mainland China and takes into account travel restrictions to and from international destinations. We estimate widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in February, 2020. Modeling results indicate international travel as the key driver of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the West and East Coast metropolitan areas that could have been seeded as early as late-December, 2019. For most of the continental states the largest contribution of imported infections arrived through domestic travel flows.","Davis, J.

193,Initial characterisation of ELISA assays and the immune response of the clinically correlated SARS-CoV-2 biobank SERO-BL-COVID-19 collected during the pandemic onset in Switzerland,"Background: To accurately measure seroprevalance in the population, boththe expected immune response as well as the assay performances have to be well characterised. Here, we describe the collection and initial characterisation of a blood and saliva biobank obtained after the initial peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. Methods: Two laboratory ELISA assays measuring IgA & IgG (Euroimmun), and IgM & IgG (Epitope Diagnostics) were used to characterise the biobank collected from 349 re- and convalescent patients from the canton of Basel-Landschaft. Findings: The antibody response in terms of recognized epitopes is diverse, especially in oligosymptomatic patients, while the average strength of the antibody response of the population does correlate with the severity of the disease at each time point. Interpretation: The diverse immune response presents a challenge when conducting epidemiological studies as the used assays only detect 90% of the oligosymptomatic cases. This problem cannot be rectified by using more sensitive assays or lower cut-offs as they concomitantly reduce specificity.

194,Two-Stage Adaptive Pooling with RT-qPCR for COVID-19 Screening,"We propose two-stage adaptive pooling schemes, 2-STAP and 2-STAMP, for detecting COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test kits. Similar to the Tapestry scheme of Ghosh et al., the proposed schemes leverage soft information from the RT-qPCR process about the total viral load in the pool. This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al. (Tapestry) show that 10 infected people in a population of size 961 can be identified with 70.86 tests on the average with a sensitivity of 99.50% and specificity of 99.62%. This is 13.5x, 4.24x, and 1.3x the testing throughput of individual testing, Dorfman's testing, and the Tapestry scheme, respectively.","Heidarzadeh, A.; Narayanan, K.

195,"Predicting the second wave of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI","Marissa Renardy and Denise Kirschner University of Michigan Medical School The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact net- works based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.","Renardy, M.; Kirschner, D.

196,Partial Prediction of the Virus COVID-19 Spread in Russia  Based on SIR and SEIR Models,"The possibility to predict the spread of COVID-19 in Russia is studied. Particular goal is to predict the time instant when the number of infected achieves its maximum (peak). Such a partial prediction allows one to use simple epidemoics models: SIR and SEIR. Simplicity and small number of parameters are significant advantages of SIR and SEIR models under conditions of a lack of numerical initial data and structural incompleteness of models. The prediction is carried out according to public WHO datasets from March 10 to April 20, 2020. Comparison of forecast results by SIR and SEIR models are given. In both cases, the peak number of infected persons while maintaining the current level of quarantine measures is forecasted at the end of May 2020 or later. It coincides with the real data obtained in May-June, 2020. The results confirm usefulness of simple nonlinear dynamical models for partial prediction of complex epidemics processes.","Tomchin, D.; Fradkov, A.

197,The relative power of individual distancing efforts and public policies to curb the COVID-19 epidemics,"Lockdown curbs the COVID-19 epidemics but at huge costs. Public debates question its impact ompared with reliance on individual responsibility. We aim at understanding how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics. We want to, first, assess the value of lockdown compared to a counterfactual that incorporates self-protection efforts under unknown disease prevalence; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when mandatory policies are relaxed. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions, and the value of contacts. In a Nash equilibrium, individual uncoordinated efforts yield average contact intensity, which drives epidemic transmission. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to reported cases in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that the number of deaths with no lockdown but equilibrium efforts is only 1/6 to 1/10 of the number predicted with business-as-usual. However, lockdown saves at least 50% more lives than individual efforts alone. Prolonged weaker restrictions prevent an exponential rebound. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Compulsory mask wearing helps resume activity but has no impact on the epidemic. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","Aubert, C.; Augeraud-Veron, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147033v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147033v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
198,Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French Intensive Care Units according to antiviral strategies. The COVADIS multicenter observational study.,"Background Limited data are available for antiviral therapy efficacy especially for the most severe patients under mechanical ventilation suffering from Covid-19 related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Methods Observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or > 0). Results We analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having > or = 1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was frequent (64%), its incidence was different across the patients groups (P=0.01). In a post-hoc logistic multivariate regression apart from demographics characteristics and comorbidities, the use of L/R (administered to 81 of 376 patients) was associated with occurrence of AKI (OR 2.07 CI95%:1.17-3.66) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Conclusion In this observational study of moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observed a benefit of treating patients with any specific antiviral treatment. We observed an association between L/R treatment and occurrence of AKI and need for RRT.","Grimaldi, D.; Aissaoui, N.; Blonz, G.; Carbutti, G.; Courcelle, R.; Gaudry, S.; D'Hondt, A.; Higny, J.; Horlait, G.; Hraiech, S.; Lefebvre, L.; Lejeune, F.; Ly, A.; Piagnerelli, M.; Sauneuf, B.; Serck, N.; Soumagne, T.; Szychowiak, P.; Textoris, J.; Vandenbunder, B.; Vinsonneau, C.; Lascarrou, J.

199,Risk Factors for Mortality of COVID-19 Patients,"Background: Lethality rates of COVID-19 are so different between countries and continents. This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyse the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries. Methods: The Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned factors until June 29, 2020. Results: The correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity, CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r = 0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the correlation coefficient is r= 0.154. Conclusion: The great lethality of COVID-19 in western Europe and North America can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer and CVD percentage in these regions. It seems also plausible that the increased obesity in the USA and vitamin D deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths.","Ouchetto, O.; Drissi Bourhanbour, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145375v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145375v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True

Methods: A retrospective cohort study of the 358 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients was conducted. 226 patients met inclusion criteria for analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox regression method were utilized to control and adjust for confounding factors. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients were managed with hydroxychloroquine (HQ) plus antibiotics (n = 31) or conservative treatment (n = 195). Results: Kaplan-Meier curves drawn using propensity score-matched data revealed no differences between the length of time to viral clearance and duration of hospital stay between the two treatment arms (p=0.18, p=0.088). Multivariable Cox regression analysis similarly showed that time to viral clearance(Hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, [95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.67]) and symptom duration(HR 1.05, [95%-CI: 0.62-1.78]) were not different between groups. No severe adverse event or death was observed in either group. Conclusions: HQ with antibiotics was not associated with better clinical outcomes in terms of time to viral clearance, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms compared to conservative treatment alone.

202,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey Pilot,"Objective: To estimate the percentage of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) over time in the community in England and to quantify risk factors. Design: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given. Setting: England. Participants: 34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors. Results: The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In 133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms, stably over time. Conclusion: The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.","Pouwels, K.

203,Projections and early-warning signals of a second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois,"We present two different scenarios for a second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois and simulate them using our previously described age-of-infection model, calibrated to real-time hospital and deaths data. In the first scenario we assume that the parameters of the second wave in Illinois would be similar to those currently observed in other states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. We estimate doubling times of hospitalizations and test positivity in all states with relevant publicly available data and calculate the corresponding effective reproduction numbers for Illinois. These parameters are remarkably consistent in states with rapidly growing epidemics. We conjecture that the emergence of the second wave of the epidemic in these states can be attributed to superspreading events at large parties, crowded bars, and indoor dining. In our second, more optimistic scenario we assume changes in Illinois state policy would result in successful mitigation of superspreading events and thus would lower the effective reproduction number to the value observed in late June 2020. In this case our calculations show effective suppression of the second wave in Illinois. Our analysis also suggests that the logarithmic time derivatives of COVID-19 hospitalizations and case positivity can serve as a simple but strong early-warning signal of the onset of a second wave.","Weiner, Z.; Wong, G.; Elbanna, A.; Tkachenko, A.; Maslov, S.; Goldenfeld, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147868v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147868v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True

Because there has been no COVID-19 outbreak in a refugee camp to date, the potential for nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in refugee camps remains untested. We used an agent-based model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks in the Moria refugee camp, and we studied the effects of feasible interventions. Subdividing the camp ('sectoring') ""flattened the curve,"" reducing peak infection by up to 70% and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly to be effective. Lockdowns had little effect on COVID-19 dynamics. Our findings provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies against COVID-19 or future epidemics.","Gilman, R. T.; Mahroof-Shaffi, S.; Harkensee, C.; Chamberlain, A.

205,Are men dying more than women by COVID-19?,"We aimed to clarify if the infection and death rate by COVID-19 differ among gender in the top 50 countries with the highest death rates. Also, we investigated if secondary variables such as HDI, number of hospital beds, average age, temperature, percentage of elderly, smoker and obesity are contributing to the variability observed among countries. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions approaches were applied to official public data reported by the Word Health Organization and governments until May, 2020. A random effect model was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was calculated by I2 statistic. There was not significative difference between men and women to be infected by COVID-19 (P = 0.42), though a significative difference was observed for death rate (P < 0.0001). High heterogeneity was observed among countries. For both infection and death rates this variability was mainly explained by the HDI (42.3% and 54.2%), average age (40.9% and 40.3%) and temperature (30.1% and 39.3%). Man are dying more than women around the word by COVID-19. Countries with highest HDI present less difference between sexes.

206,WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework Version 1.0: Criteria and considerations to guide evidence-informed decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions targeting COVID-19,"Background: Decision-making on matters of public health requires the balancing of numerous, often conflicting factors. One approach to ensure relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria underpinning the decision is a broad societal discourse and participatory decision-making process. However, this often was not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, evidence-to-decision frameworks can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered, even if not all voices of affected stakeholders could be heard in the process. Objective: The objective of this research project was to develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges decision-makers face when deliberating on national and sub-national level on non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to address the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In phase I, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies. In phase II, we used the best-fit framework synthesis technique with the output of phase I serving as a priori framework. We conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide the policy makers on the phasing out of the lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous versions into the WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework (WICID framework) Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, which are expanded on through 49 aspects contained within them, and the metacriterion quality of evidence. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental rights, acceptability considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion: In a third phase, the framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society.

207,Multi-Omics integration analysis of respiratory specimen characterizes baseline molecular determinants associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Abstract: Rapid diagnosis and precise prognostication of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a major challenge. A multi-omic approach was adopted, and in the discovery phase, global proteome/metaproteome/metabolome were analysed in the respiratory specimens of SARS-CoV-2 positive [n=20], negative [n=20], and H1N1 positive [n=5] cases. We identified MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1) and WARS (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase) as clues to viral diagnosis and validated in 200 SARS-CoV-2 suspects. MX1 >30pg/ml and WARS >25ng/ml segregated virus positives patients [(AUC=94%CI(0.91-0.97)]. Distinct increase in SARS-CoV-2 induced immune activation, metabolic reprograming and a decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing, fluid regulation, vitamin and steroid metabolism was seen (p<0.05). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viraemia and segregated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the multiomics approach identified increased respiratory pathogens [Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia] and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05, p<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens. Conclusion: Novel proteins [MX1 and WARS] can rapidly and reliably diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify asymptomatic and mild disease.","Maras, J. S.; Sharma, S.; Bhat, A.

208,Molecular tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy in the first three months of the epidemic,"The aim of this study is the characterization and genomic tracing by phylogenetic analyses of 59 new SARS-CoV-2 Italian isolates obtained from patients attending clinical centres in North and Central Italy until the end of April 2020. All but one of the newly characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Lai, A.; Bergna, A.; Caucci, S.; Clementi, N.; Vicenti, I.; Dragoni, F.; Cattelan, A.

210,Does sub-Saharan Africa truly defy the forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic? Response from population data,"Introduction. Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the projected and actual numbers as well as population proportions of COVID-19 cases in the 46 sub-Saharan African countries on May 1st, May 29th (4 weeks later) and June 26th (8 weeks later). The source of the projected number of cases was a publication by scientists from the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whereas the actual number of cases was obtained from the WHO situation reports. We calculated the percentage difference between the projected and actual numbers of cases per country. Further, N-1 chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the projected and actual population proportion of COVID-19 cases, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference between these population proportions. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with 0.05 used as threshold for statistical significance. Results. On May 1st, May 29th and June 26th, respectively 40 (86.95%), 45 (97.82%) and 41 (89.13%) of the sub-Saharan African countries reported a number of confirmed cases that was lower than the predicted number of 1000 cases for May 1st and 10000 for both May 29th and June 26th. At these dates, the population proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases were significantly lower (p-value <0.05) than the projected proportions of cases. Across all these dates, South-Africa always exceeded the predicted number and population proportion of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion. Sub-Saharan African countries did defy the dire predictions of the COVID-19 burden. Preventive measures should be further enforced to preserve this positive outcome.","Christophe Dongmo, F.

211,Reopening universities during the COVID-19 pandemic: A testing strategy to minimize active cases and delay outbreaks,"Background: University campuses present an ideal environment for viral spread and are therefore at extreme risk of serving as a hotbed for a COVID-19 outbreak. While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","Rennert, L.; Kalbaugh, C.

213,Early Diagnosis and Clinical Significance of Acute Cardiac Injury - Under the Iceberg: A Retrospective Cohort Study of 619 Non-critically Ill Hospitalized COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a viral pneumonia together with other extrapulmonary complications. Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[&ge;]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[&ge;]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.","Xie, Y.; Chen, S.; Wang, X.; Li, B.; Zhang, T.; He, X.; Sun, N.; Wang, L.; Zeng, H.; Shen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147256v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147256v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
214,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and COVID-19 infection or hospitalization: a cohort study,"There are plausible mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection or affect disease severity.

Among people aged [&ge;]18 years enrolled in the health plan for at least 4 months as of 2/29/2020, current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications. COVID-19 infections were identified through 6/14/2020 from laboratory and hospitalization data. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. Among 322,044 individuals, 720 developed COVID-19 infection. Among people using ACEI/ARBs, 183/56,105 developed COVID-19 (3.3 per 1000 individuals) compared with 537/265,939 without ACEI/ARB use (2.0 per 1000), yielding an adjusted OR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.75-1.16). For use of < 1 defined daily dose vs. nonuse, the adjusted OR for infection was 0.89 (95% CI 0.62-1.26); for 1 to < 2 defined daily doses, 0.97 (95% CI 0.71-1.31); and for [&ge;]2 defined daily doses, 0.94 (95% CI 0.72-1.23).

215,Early Detection Of COVID-19 Using A Smartwatch,"Wearable devices digitally measuring vital signs have been used for monitoring health and illness onset and have high potential for real-time monitoring and disease detection. As such they are potentially useful during public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Using smartwatch data from 31 infected individuals identified from a cohort of over 5000 participants, we investigated the use of wearables for early, presymptomatic detection of COVID-19. From physiological and activity data, we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases. Failure to detect these changes in the remaining patients often occurred in those with chronic respiratory/lung disease. Importantly the physiological alterations were detected prior to, or at, symptom onset in over 85% of the positive cases (21/24), in some cases nine or more days before symptoms. Through daily surveys we can track physiological changes with symptom onset and severity. Finally, we develop a method to detect onset of COVID-19 infection in real-time which detects 67% of infection cases at or before symptom onset. Our study provides a roadmap to a rapid and universal diagnostic method for the large-scale detection of respiratory viral infections in advance of symptoms, highlighting a useful approach for managing epidemics using digital tracking and health monitoring.","Mishra, T.; Wang, M.; Metwally, A.

216,Could masks curtail the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19 in the US?,"The community lockdown measures implemented in the United States, during late March to end of May of 2020, resulted in a significant reduction in the community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering the fear for a possible severe second wave of the pandemic in some US jurisdictions. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt or curtail such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. The model was parametrized and fitted using cumulative mortality data from the four jurisdictions. Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are greatly augmented if the early implementation of the lockdown measures is complemented with a public face masks use strategy. It is shown that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. If the level of lifting of community lockdown is high (which entails allowing for greater community contacts and re-opening of businesses and social activities, in comparison to what was allowed during the community lockdown period), the states of Arizona and Florida will record a devastating second wave of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the level of lifting for the community lockdown was mild (i.e., only allowing very limited community contacts and business activities, in comparison to the lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. The severity of the projected second wave depends on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida, associated with moderate and high level of lifting of lockdown, will be more severe than their respective first wave. For high level of lifting of lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic. In particular, for this high lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period). A testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with universal face mask use strategy. Universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (or severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","Ngonghala, C.

217,Predicted effects of summer holidays and seasonality on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in France,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France has had a large death toll. It has not affected all regions similarly, since the death rate can vary several folds between regions where the epidemic has remained at a low level and regions where it got an early burst. The epidemic has been slowed down by a lockdown that lasted for almost eight weeks, and individuals can now move between metropolitan French regions without restriction. In this report we investigate the effect on the epidemic of summer holidays, during which millions of individuals will move between French regions. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of strong or weak seasonality and of several values for the reproduction number on the epidemic, in particular on the timing, the height and the spread of a second wave. To do so, we extend a SEIR model to simulate the effect of summer migrations between regions on the number and distribution of new infections. We find that the model predicts little effect of summer migrations on the epidemic. However, all the reproduction numbers above 1.0 and the seasonality parameters we tried result in a second epidemic wave, with a peak date that can vary between October 2020 and April 2021. If the sanitary measures currently in place manage to keep the reproduction number below 1.0, the second wave will be avoided. If they keep the reproduction number at a low value, for instance at 1.1 as in one of our simulations, the second wave is flattened and could be similar to the first wave.","Duchemin, L.; Veber, P.; Paris, M.; Boussau, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
218,Change points in the spread of COVID-19 question the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany,"Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown"" (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","Wieland, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146837v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146837v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
219,Examining the protection efficacy of face shields against cough aerosol droplets using water sensitive papers,"Simple plastic face shields have many advantages compared to regular medical masks. They are easily cleaned for reuse and comfortable to wear. In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for medical masks, as a recommendation to the general population, was tested. Testing the efficacy of the protective equipment utilized a cough simulator that was carefully tuned to replicate human cough in terms of droplet size distribution and outlet velocity. The tested protective equipment was worn on a manikin head simulating human breathing. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) was used to analyze the concentration and size distribution of small particles that reach the manikin head respiration pathways. Additionally, Water sensitive papers were taped over and under the tested protective equipment, and were subsequently photographed and analyzed. For droplets larger than 3m by diameter, the efficiency of shields to block cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular medical masks, with enhanced protection on face parts the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, of the order 0.3 to few microns, a shield was found to perform even better, blocking about 10 times more fine particles than the medical mask. This implies that for the general population that is not intendedly exposed to confirmed infected individuals, recommending the use of face shields as an alternative to medical masks should be considered.","Ronen, A.; Rotter, H.; Elisha, S.; Sevilia, S.; Parizer, B.; Hafif, N.; Manor, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147090v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147090v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True

Design: Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records Setting: Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants: 1,198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired RT-PCR swabs for SARS-CoV 2 and CXR between 16th March and 16th April 2020 Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. Odds ratios of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. For CT scans these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41-0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT compared with CXR, of 29% (95% CI 19%-38%, p<0.0001). Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. Chest X-ray findings were not statistically significantly or clinical meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions: Computed tomography has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.","Borakati, A.; Perera, A.; Johnson, J.; Sood, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147934v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147934v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
221,COVID-19 incidence trends between April and June 2020: A global analysis,"The study sought to investigate how the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have evolved in the most recent three months across the world, and what insights the trends may provide about the second half of the pandemic's first year using a situation analysis approach based on national income, temperature, trade intensity with China, and location defined by longitude and latitude. The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15 degrees N region and the Below 15 degrees S region during their summer months because the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15 degrees S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15 degrees S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15 degrees N region during these past months. Such preventative measures may allow the world to avoid the drastic lockdown policies and facilitate rapid global economic recovery from this pandemic.","Amanor-Boadu, V.; Ross, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148007v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148007v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
222,A topic analysis of traditional and social media news coverage of the early COVID-19 pandemic and implications for public health communication,"Knowledge gaps may initially exist among scientists, medical and public health professionals during pandemics, which are fertile grounds for misinformation in news media. We characterized and compared COVID-19 coverage in newspapers, television, and social media, and discussed implications for public health communication strategies that are relevant to an initial pandemic response. We conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modelling technique, analysis of 3,271 newspaper articles, 40 cable news shows transcripts, 96,000 Twitter posts, and 1,000 Reddit posts during March 4 - 12, 2020, a period chronologically early in the timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage of COVID-19 clustered on topics such as epidemic, politics, and the economy, and these varied across media sources. Topics dominating news were not predominantly health-related, suggesting a limited presence of public health in news coverage in traditional and social media. Examples of misinformation were identified particularly in social media. Public health entities should utilize communication specialists to create engaging informational content to be shared on social media sites. Public health officials should be attuned to their target audience to anticipate and prevent spread of common myths likely to exist within a population. This will help control misinformation in early stages of pandemics.","Chipidza, W.; Akbaripourdibazar, E.; Gwanzura, T.; Gatto, N.

223,Passive Monitoring of Physiological Data and Self-reported Symptoms to Detect Clusters of People with COVID-19,"Traditional screening for COVID-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms, travel history, and sometimes temperature measurements. We explored whether longitudinal, personal sensor data can help identify subtle changes which may indicate an infection, such as COVID-19. To do this we developed an app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results from participants living in the US. We assessed whether symptoms and sensor data could differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. Between March 25 and June 7, 2020, we enrolled 30,529 participants, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms, 54 reported testing positive for COVID-19, and 279 negative. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an AUC=0.80 [0.73 - 0.86] which was significantly better (p < 0.01) than a model which just considered symptoms alone (AUC=0.71 [0.63 - 0.79]) in the discrimination between symptomatic individuals positive or negative for COVID-19. Such orthogonal, continuous, passively captured data may be complementary to virus testing that is generally a one-off, or infrequent, sampling assay.","Quer, G.; Radin, J.

224,An SEIR Model with Contact Tracing and Age-Structured Social Mixing for COVID-19 outbreak,"In December 2019 a severe acute respiratory syndrome now known as SARS-CoV-2 began to surge in Wuhan, China. The virus soon spread throughout the world to become a pandemic. Since the outbreak various measures were put in place to contain and control the spread, these interventions were mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology with the main goal of controlling and monitoring the rate of the basic and effective reproduction number. In this paper, we propose an SEIR model where we incorporate contact tracing and age-structured social mixing. We show the explicit relation between contact tracing and social mixing and other relevant parameters of the proposed model. We derive a formula for the effective reproduction number which is expressed in terms of reported cases, tracing quantities and social mixing. We use this formula to determine the expectation value of the effective reproduction number in London, UK.","Teimouri, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146647v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146647v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
225,Implementing a Negative Pressure Isolation Space within a Skilled Nursing Facility to Control SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,"Background: Isolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission. Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. Purpose: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. Basic Procedures: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. Main Findings: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the pandemic.

227,Organization of Primary Health Care in pandemics: a rapid systematic review of the literature in times of COVID-19,"The world is experiencing one of the greatest public health emergencies in history with the global spread of COVID-19. Health systems, including Primary Health Care (PHC) services, are pillars of pandemic coping strategies, and there are important gaps in the literature on the best ways to organize PHC in health crisis scenarios such as the one currently experienced. Given the urgency of responses, we performed a rapid systematic literature review on MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE and LILACS (via VHL), in order to analyze empirical studies on the effectiveness of PHC organization strategies in the context of epidemics to improve access and reduce morbidity and mortality. We selected seven articles, which studied the responses to different epidemics in different parts of the world. In terms of access, the studies suggest positive results with the adoption of adjustments of work processes of the teams and the structure of the services, combined with diversification of actions (including call center), adequate provision of inputs and personal protective equipment, adequate action plans and communication strategies, and effective integration with public health services and other levels of care. No study analyzed population morbidity and mortality. The included studies suggest also that community-oriented PHC is more effective in crisis scenarios, indicating the necessity of strengthening of the Family Health Strategy in the Brazilian context.","Sarti, T.

228,Impact of Congestive Heart Failure and Role of Cardiac Biomarkers in COVID-19 patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to cause worse outcomes in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, especially in patients with acute cardiac injury, which is determined by elevated levels of high-sensitivity troponin. There is a paucity of data on the impact of congestive heart failure (CHF) on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from 11/1/2019 till 06/07/2020, and identified all relevant studies reporting cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, disease severity, and survival. Pooled data from the selected studies were used for metanalysis to identify the impact of risk factors and cardiac biomarker elevation on disease severity and/or mortality. Results: We collected pooled data on 5,967 COVID-19 patients from 20 individual studies. We found that both non-survivors and those with severe disease had an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmias, our pooled relative risk (RR) was - 8.52 (95% CI 3.63-19.98) (p<0.001); and 3.61 (95% CI 2.03-6.43) (p=0.001), respectively. Mean difference in the levels of Troponin-I, CK-MB, and NT-proBNP was higher in deceased and severely infected patients. The RR of in-hospital mortality was 2.35 (95% CI 1.18-4.70) (p=0.022) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.12-2.05) (p=0.008) among patients who had pre-existing CHF and hypertension, respectively. Conclusion: Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 infection appears to significantly adversely impact patient prognosis and survival.

229,"COVID-19 presenting as anosmia and dysgeusia in New York City emergency departments, March - April, 2020","Background: Increasing evidence has been emerging of anosmia and dysgeusia as frequently reported symptoms in COVID-19. Improving our understanding of these presenting symptoms may facilitate the prompt recognition of the disease in emergency departments and prevent further transmission. Methods: We examined a cross-sectional cohort using New York City emergency department syndromic surveillance data for March and April 2020. Emergency department visits for anosmia and/or dysgeusia were identified and subsequently matched to the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System to determine testing results for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 683 patients with anosmia and/or dysgeusia included, SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for 232 (34%) and 168 (72%) were found to be positive. Median age of all patients presenting with anosmia and/or dysgeusia symptoms was 38, and 54% were female. Anosmia and/or dysgeusia was the sole complaint of 158 (23%) patients, of whom 35 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 23 (66%) were positive. While the remaining patients presented with at least one other symptom, nearly half of all patients (n=334, 49%) and more than a third of those who tested positive (n=62, 37%) did not have any of the CDC-established symptoms used for screening of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Conclusions and Relevance: Anosmia and/or dysgeusia have been frequent complaints among patients presenting to emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, while only a small proportion of patients ultimately underwent testing for SARS-CoV-19, the majority of patients tested have been positive. Anosmia and dysgeusia likely represent underrecognized symptoms of COVID-19 but may have important future implications in disease diagnosis and surveillance.","Wang, T.

230,COVID-19 screening strategies that permit the safe re-opening of college campuses,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges: either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define SARS-CoV-2 screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to campus for the Fall 2020 semester. Design: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate campus screening using tests of varying frequency (daily-weekly), sensitivity (70%-99%), specificity (98%-99.7%), and cost ($10-$50/test). Reproductive numbers Rt = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5} defined three epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. We generally adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of 5000 college-age, uninfected students. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. All measured over an 80-day, abbreviated semester. Results: With Rt = 2.5, daily screening with a 70% sensitive, 98% specific test produces 85 cumulative student infections and isolation dormitory daily census averaging 108 (88% false positives). Screening every 2 (7) days nets 135 (3662) cumulative infections and daily isolation census 66 (252) with 73% (4%) false positives. Across all scenarios, test frequency exerts more influence on outcomes than test sensitivity. Cost-effectiveness analysis selects screening every {2, 1, 7} days with a 70% sensitive test as the preferred strategy for Rt = {2.5, 3.5, 1.5}, implying a screening cost of {$470, $920, $120} per student per semester. Conclusions & Relevance: Rapid, inexpensive and frequently conducted screening (even if only 70% sensitive) would be cost-effective and produce a modest number of COVID-19 infections. While the optimal screening frequency hinges on the success of behavioral interventions to reduce the base severity of transmission (Rt), this could permit the safe return of student to campus.","Paltiel, A.

231,Evaluation of a genetic risk score for severity of COVID-19 using human chromosomal-scale length variation.,"The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown. One possibility is that genetic variation is partly responsible for the highly variable response. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosomal-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age matched patients drawn for the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers characterizing the chromosomal-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe reaction to COVID-19 based only on their 88-number classification. We found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a significant level (p=2*10^(-11)) as measured against a randomized control and (p=3*10^(-14)) as measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC=0.5). However, we found that the AUC of the classifier was only 0.51, too low for a clinically useful test. Genetics play a role in the severity of COVID-19, but we cannot yet develop a useful genetic test to predict severity.","Toh, C.; Brody, J.

The five parameters of the analysis are themes, content types, sources, coverage, and intentions. First, the six major themes of fake news are health, religiopolitical, political, crime, entertainment, religious, and miscellaneous. Health-related fake news (67.2%) dominates the others. Second, the seven types of fake news contents have four main types: text, photo, audio and video, and three combined types: text & photo; text & video; and text & photo & video. More fake news takes the forms of text & video (47.2%), while the main types of content are less popular. Third, the two main sources of fake news are online media and mainstream media, where online-produced fake news (94.4%) prevails. Fourth, the main two types of coverages are international and national, and more fake news has an international connection (54.4%). Fifth, the intention of fake news has three types: positive, negative, and unknown. Most of the COVID-19-related fake news is negative (63.2%).

233,Association between consumption of fermented vegetables and COVID-19 mortality at a country level in Europe,"Background Many foods have an antioxidant activity and nutrition may mitigate COVID-19. Some of the countries with a low COVID-19 mortality are those with a relatively high consumption of traditional fermented foods. To test the potential role of fermented foods in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of fermented vegetables, pickled/marinated vegetables, fermented milk, yoghurt and fermented sour milk. We obtained the COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for data on potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people older than 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models - with log of population as an offset - to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only fermented vegetables reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g/day increase in the average national consumption of fermented vegetables, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by 35.4% (95% CI: 11.4%, 35.5%). Adjustment did not change the point estimate and results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and consumption of fermented vegetables supports the a priory hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of fermented vegetables is common.","Fonseca, S.; Rivas, I.; Romaguera, D.; Quijal, M.; Czarlewski, W.; Vidal, A.; Fonseca, J.; Ballester, J.; Anto, J.; Basagana, X.; Cunha, L.

234,Animal Model Prescreening: Pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 impacts responses in the NHP model,"COVID-19 presents herculean challenges to research and scientific communities for producing diagnostic and treatment solutions. Any return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures, with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics. Animal disease status and potential COVID-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing. We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate pre-challenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal pre-screening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.One Sentence Summary Pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 affects biomarker responses in animal models, highlighting a need for robust pre-screening protocols prior to medical countermeasure studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Ricks, K.

235,Renal carcinoma is associated with increased risk of coronavirus infections,"The current pandemic COVID-19 has affected most severely to the people with old age, or with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and cancers. Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors’ expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tripathi, S.

236,Conserved Genomic Terminals of SARS-CoV-2 as Co-evolving Functional Elements and Potential Therapeutic Targets,"ABSTRACTTo identify features in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3’-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response.

237,Comparison of three TaqMan Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2,"Quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for COVID-19 control. Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xiao, Y.; Li, Z.; Wang, X.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Wang, G.; Ren, L.; Li, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189860v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189860v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
238,Identification of potent and safe antiviral therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xiao, X.; Wang, C.; Chang, D.; Wang, Y.; Dong, X.; Jiao, T.; Zhao, Z.; Ren, L.; Dela Cruz, C.

239,N and O glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motifs on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sanda, M.; Morrison, L.; Goldman, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
240,Sample Pooling as an efficient strategy for SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR screening: a multicenter study in Spain,"Importance: The actual demand on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is a current challenge for clinical laboratories. Sample pooling may help to ameliorate workload in clinical laboratories. Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of sample pooling compared to the individual analysis for the diagnosis of CoVID-19, by using different commercial platforms for nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Design and settings: observational, prospective, multicentre study across 9 Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories including SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing performed in April 2020, during the first three days after acceptance to participate. Participants and Methods: 3519 naso-oro-pharyngeal samples received at the participating laboratories were processed individually and in pools (351 pools) according to the existing methodology in each of the centres. Results: We found that 253 pools (2519 samples) were negative, and 99 pools (990 samples) were positive; with 241 positive samples (6.85%), our pooling strategy would have saved 2167 PCR tests. For 29 pools (made out of 290 samples) we found discordant results when compared to their correspondent individual samples: in 24/29 pools (30 samples), minor discordances were found; for five pools (5 samples), we found major discordances. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for pooling were 97.93%, 100%, 100% and 99.85% respectively; accuracy was 99.86% and kappa concordant coefficient was 0.988. As a result of the sample dilution effect of pooling, a loss of 2-3 Cts was observed for E, N or RdRP genes. Conclusion: we show a high efficiency of pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, across different RNA extraction and amplification platforms, with excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. We believe that our results may help clinical laboratories to respond to the actual demand and clinical need on SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially for the screening of low prevalence populations.","de Salazar, A.; Aguilera, A.; Trastoy, R.; Fuentes, A.; Alados, J.

242,Gene Expression Network Analysis Provides Potential Targets Against SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTBACKGROUND Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

243,Comparison of Transgenic and Adenovirus hACE2 Mouse Models for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Rathnasinghe, R.; Strohmeier, S.; Amanat, F.; Gillespie, V.

244,Discovery of Drug-like Ligands for the Mac1 Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3,"ABSTRACTThe Mac1 domain of the multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) is a potential COVID-19 drug target because it is suspected to enhance the ability of the virus to evade the human immune system. The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain binds ADP-ribose and proteins harboring this important post-translational modification. Small molecules that bind the Mac1 domain in place of ADP-ribose might therefore be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for antiviral drug discovery. Two high throughput screens were used here to identify such ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. The first screen used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, aka the thermal shift or ThermoFluor assay) to examine the melting temperature of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain in the presence of various compounds. In the second screen, various high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structures were used with Autodock VINA to identify potential ligands. Numerous hit compounds were either steroids (estradiol valerate &amp; flunisolide), beta-lactams (cefaclor &amp; cefatrizine), or benzimidazoles (telmisartan, rabeprazole, omeprazole, &amp; esomeprazole). Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to confirm that rabeprazole, omeprazole, and compounds in other chemical classes, such as irinotecan, nifedipine, trifluoperazine, bind SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with an affinity similar to ADP-ribose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Virdi, R.

245,Split ventilation with pressure regulators for patient-specific tidal volumes,"As a measure of last resort during the COVID-19 pandemic, single mechanical ventilators have been repurposed to support multiple patients. In existing split-ventilator configurations using FDA-approved tubing adaptors, each patient receives the same inspiratory pressure, requiring careful matching of patients to avoid barotrauma. Progression of disease may cause tidal volumes to diverge from desired targets, and routine interventions (eg. suctioning) in one patient may adversely affect other patients. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a split-ventilator configuration that enables individualized patient management by incorporating a commonly available pressure regulator used for gas appliances. We validate this method by achieving various combinations of tidal volume in each of two synthetic lungs using a standard ventilator machine in combination with two gas flow analyzers. With further safety testing and instrumentation, pressure regulators may represent a viable path to substantially augment the capacity for ventilation in resource-constrained settings.","Srinivasan, L.; Rishel, C.

246,High frequency of cerebrospinal fluid autoantibodies in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms,"COVID-19 intensive care patients occasionally develop neurological symptoms. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain. All patients had anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF when assessing a large panel of autoantibodies against intracellular and surface antigens relevant for central nervous system diseases using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Antigens included proteins well-established in clinical routine, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also a variety of specific undetermined epitopes on brain sections. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures). While several underlying autoantigens still await identification in future studies, presence of autoantibodies may explain some aspects of multi-organ disease in COVID-19 and can guide immunotherapy in selected cases.","Franke, C.; Ferse, C.; Kreye, J.; Reincke, M.; Sanchez-Sendin, E.; Rocco, A.; Steinbrenner, M.; Angermair, S.; Treskatsch, S.; Zickler, D.; Eckardt, K.-U.; Dersch, R.; Hosp, J.; Audebert, H.

Design/Methods MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library databases and medrxiv.org were searched from January 1st, 2020, to June 15th, 2020. Data were extracted from studies reporting the prevalence of HIV among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their clinical outcomes. Analyses were performed using random-effects models on log-transformed proportions and risk ratio estimates, and heterogeneity was quantified. Results A total of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified from 14 studies in North America, Europe, and Asia. Median age was 55 years, and 66% were male. The pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%).

248,Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: There is no effective therapy for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used for its treatment but their safety and efficacy remain uncertain. Objective: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 to 8th June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. Results: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies. Meta-analysis of included studies revealed no significant reduction in mortality with HCQ use [RR 0.98 95% CI 0.66-1.46] , time to fever resolution [mean difference -0.54 days (-1.19-011)] or clinical deterioration/development of ARDS with HCQ [RR 0.90 95% CI 0.47-1.71]. There was a higher risk of ECG abnormalities/arrhythmia with HCQ/CQ [RR 1.46 95% CI 1.04 to 2.06]. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for these outcomes. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed randomized trials are required for assessing the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19.","Elavarasi, A.; Prasad, M.; Seth, T.; Sahoo, R.

249,Associations between state-level healthcare access and COVID-19 case trajectories in the United States,"Introduction: We conducted an ecological study to determine if state-level healthcare access is associated with trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases in the United States. Our focus is on trajectories of daily reported COVID-19 cases, rather than cumulative cases, as trajectories help us identify trends in how the pandemic naturally develops over time, and study the shapes of the curve in different states. Methods: We analyzed data on daily reported confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases from January 21 to June 16, 2020 in 50 states, adjusted for the population size of each state. Cluster analysis for time-series data was used to split the states into clusters that have distinct trajectories of daily cases. Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare access between clusters were tested. Adjusted models were used to determine if healthcare access is associated with reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Results: Two clusters of states were identified. One cluster had a high trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases, and comprised of 19 states, including New York and New Jersey. The other cluster of states (n=31) had a low trajectory of population-adjusted COVID-19 cases. There were significantly more Black residents (p=0.027) and more nursing facility residents (p=0.001) in states reporting high trajectory of COVID-19 cases. States reporting a high trajectory of COVID-19 cases also had fewer uninsured persons (p=0.005), fewer persons who reported having to forgo medical care due to cost (p=0.016), more registered physicians (p=0.002) and more nurses (p=0.03), higher health spending per capita (p=0.01), fewer residents in Health Professional Shortage Areas per 100,000 population (p=0.027), and higher adoption of Medicaid Expansion (p=0.05). In adjusted models, a higher proportion of uninsured persons (OR: 0.51 [0.25-0.85]; p=0.032), higher proportion of patients who had to forgo medical care due to cost (OR: 0.55 [0.28-0.95]; p=0.048), and no adoption of Medicaid expansion (OR: 0.05 [0-0.59]; p=0.04), were associated with reporting a low trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Our findings from adjusted models suggest that healthcare access can partially explain variations in COVID-19 case trajectories by state.","Liu, S.

250,Study of the Dependence of Effective Reproduction Number of COVID-19 on the Temperature and Humidity: A Case Study with the Indian States,"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan province of China in November 2019 and within a short time, it was declared as a worldwide pandemic by World Health Organisation due to very fast worldwide spread of the virus. In the absence of any vaccine, various mitigation measures were used. In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We are studying the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between effective reproduction number with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states show a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 is low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.","Mandal, M.; Patra, S.; Pal, S.; Acharya, S.; Hazra, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146324v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146324v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
251,Explainable death toll motion modeling: COVID-19 narratives and counterfactuals,"Models have gained the spotlight in many discussions surrounding COVID-19. The urgency for timely decisions resulted in a multitude of models as informed policy actions must be made even when so many uncertainties about the pandemic still remain. In this paper, we use machine learning algorithms to build intuitive country-level COVID-19 motion models described by death toll velocity and acceleration. Model explainability techniques provide insightful data-driven narratives about COVID-19 death toll motion models $-$ while velocity is explained by factors that are increasing/reducing death toll pace now, acceleration anticipates the effects of public health measures on slowing the death toll pace.

252,SARS-CoV-2 contributes to altering the post-transcriptional regulatory networks across human tissues by sponging RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key pos-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Srivastava, R.; Daulatabad, S.

253,Evaluation of Viasure SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit (CerTest Biotec) using CDC FDA EUA RT-qPCR kit as a gold standard.,"Abstract. Background. Several RT-qPCR kits are available for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, some of them with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA, but most of them lacking of proper evaluation studies due to covid19 emergency. Objective. We evaluated Viasure RT-qPCR kit (CerTest Biotec, Spain) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using CDC FDA EUA kit as gold standard. Results. Although we found the lack of RNA quality control probe as the main limitation for Viasure kit, the sensitivity was up to 97.5% and specificity was 100%. Conclusions. Viasure RT-qPCR kit is a reliable tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis but improvement of an alternative RT-qPCR reaction for RNA extraction quality control as RNaseP is recommended.","Freire-Paspuel, B.; Vega-Marino, P.

254,Comparison of two commercial platforms and a laboratory developed test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests, cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag(R) COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas(R) test (100%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas(R) test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag(R) test (98.8%) and the highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas(R) assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas(R) test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.","Mannonen, L.; Kallio-Kokko, H.; Loginov, R.; Jaaskelainen, A.; Jokela, P.; Antikainen, J.; Vare, P.; Kekalainen, E.; Kurkela, S.; Jarva, H.; Lappalainen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20144758v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
255,The UK Covid-19 lockdown weakened in April and May 2020: implications for the size of the epidemic and for outcomes had lockdown been earlier,"The number of active cases in the UK Covid-19 epidemic, the case fatality rate, the susceptible proportion of the population, and how well the lockdown was maintained during April-May 2020 are unknown. These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier lockdown, mobility and interactions would have followed a similar course, then with a large epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier lockdowns, total deaths were found to depend on the size of the epidemic and to vary from 2,000-49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%, reported by the Office for National Statistics in May and June 2020, since to accommodate a weakening lockdown, the shape of the daily mortality curve, and an acceptable case fatality rate a much larger epidemic curve is required.","Lander, A.

256,Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity,"AbstractTo dissect the mechanisms underlying the observed inflation of variants in SARS-CoV-2 genome, we present the largest up-to-date analysis of intra-host genomic diversity, which reveals that the majority of samples present a complex sublineage architecture, due to the interplay between host-related mutational processes and transmission dynamics.Strikingly, the deconvolution of the entire set of intra-host variants reveals the existence of mutually exclusive viral mutational signatures, which prove that distinct hosts differently respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Graudenzi, A.; Maspero, D.; Angaroni, F.; Piazza, R.; Ramazzotti, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
257,"Computational fluid dynamic (CFD), air flow-droplet dispersion, and indoor CO2 analysis for healthy public space configuration to complywith COVID 19 protocol","The droplet has a limited travel distance. Nonetheless, especially in the indoor public space the air flow can propagate the droplet to travel long distance. Based on this situation, this paper aims to study the relationships of seat configuration-social distance-air flow-droplet dispersions. The analysis was based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) using lattice Boltzmann model (LBM). The result confirms that by modifying public space configuration in this case by providing more space and increasing seating distance can reduce the vulnerability towards droplet dispersions. Whereas, providing shield including adding protection is far more effective in avoiding dispersions. The public space reconfiguration including increasing seat distance and reducing seating capacity also has an effect in reducing the indoor CO2. Capacity reduction from full capacity to 30% can decrease the CO2 from 5722 to 2144 ppm.","Adwibowo, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145219v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145219v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
258,Dual-Histamine Blockade with Cetirizine - Famotidine Reduces Pulmonary Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as a result of a pulmonary cytokine storm. Antihistamines are safe and effective treatments for reducing inflammation and cytokine release. Combinations of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor antagonists have been effective in urticaria, and might reduce the histamine-mediated pulmonary cytokine storm in COVID-19. Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? Methods: A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. Results: Of all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine blockade for at least 48 hours, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 hours of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited reductions in symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 patients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. Conclusions: This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a new safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm. Further clinical studies in COVID-19 are warranted of the repurposed off-label combination of two historically-safe histamine blockers.","Hogan, R. B.; Hogan, R.

259,Mapping Systemic Inflammation and Antibody Responses in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),"Initially, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spared children from severe disease. However, after the initial wave of infections, clusters of a novel hyperinflammatory disease have been reported in regions with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. While the characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains unknown. Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases. We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal isotype-switching and neutralization capability. We further profiled the secreted immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, CCL28). Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Markers of activated myeloid function were also evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses. Finally, to assess the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti- IL6R antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization of inflammatory markers.","Gruber, C.; Patel, R.; Trachman, R.; Lepow, L.; Amanat, F.; Krammer, F.; Wilson, K.

260,Daily viral kinetics and innate and adaptive immune responses assessment in COVID-19: a case series,"Background Viral shedding patterns and its correlation with the immune responses of mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients are still poorly characterized. Methods: We enrolled the first five COVID-19 patients quarantined in our institution; none received immunomodulatory treatment. We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus by RT-PCR and cell culture from the upper respiratory tract, and characterized the kinetics of systemic innate and adaptive immune responses. Results Despite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset. Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Conclusion Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases. A strong innate response, characterized by the mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection, as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable, even in patients with mild disease.","Vetter, P.; Eberhardt, C.; Meyer, B.; Martinez, P.; Torriani, G.; Pigny, F.; Lemeille, S.; Cordey, S.; Laubscher, F.; Vu, D.-L.; Calame, A.; Schibler, M.; Jacquerioz, F.; Blanchard, G.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Kaiser, L.; Didierlaurent, A.; eckerle, i.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143271v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
261,Objective sensory testing methods reveal a higher prevalence of olfactory loss in COVID-19 positive patients compared to subjective methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has currently infected over 6.5 million people worldwide. In response to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify the causes and symptoms of the disease. Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia (partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar with the keywords 'COVID-19', 'smell', and/or 'olfaction'. We included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID%[minus]19. Studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss - subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli - to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January 16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The use of subjective measures, while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss.","Hannum, M. E.; Ramirez, V. A.; Lipson, S. J.; Herriman, R.

Data were collected during their Vitamin D winter (monthly mean UVvitd of under 165 KJ/m2) from Jan to April 2020. Participants The at-risk population is the total county population, with measures to incorporate spatial infection into the model. The model is adjusted for: age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, long term PM2.5, and UV weighted by the vitamin D action spectrum. Main outcome measures We derive UVA measures for each area and estimate their relationship with COVID-19 mortality with a random effect for States, in a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. In the USA and England death certificates had to record COVID-19. In Italy excess deaths in 2020 over expected from 2015-19. Data sources Satellite derived mean daily UVA dataset from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Data on deaths compiled by Center for Disease Control (USA), Office for National Statistics (England) and Italian Institute of Statistics. Results Daily mean UVA (January-April 2020) varied between 450 to 1,000 KJ/m2 across the three countries. Our fully adjusted model showed an inverse correlation between UVA and COVID-19 mortality with a Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) of 0.73 (0.62 to 0.87)per 100KJ/m2 increase UVA in the USA, 0.81 (0.71 to 0.93) in Italy and 0.51 (0.39 to 0.66) in England. Pooled MRR was 0.68 (0.53 to 0.66). Conclusions Our analysis, replicated in 3 independent national datasets, suggests ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality.

Therefore, we sought to classify counties in the United States across multiple domains utilizing a socioecological framework and examine the association between these county-level groups and Covid-19 mortality. We harmonized and linked county-level sociodemographic, health, and environmental metrics associated with increased susceptibility for Covid-19 mortality. Latent class analysis defined a county-level susceptibility index (CSI) based on these metrics (n=2701 counties). Next, we used linear regression models to estimate the associations of the CSI and Covid-19 deaths per capita and initial mortality doubling time (as of 6/2/20), adjusted for days since first Covid-19 case. We identified 4 groups classified by the CSI with distinct sociodemographic, health, and environmental profiles and widespread geographic dispersion. Covid-19 deaths per capita were significantly higher in the group consisting of rural, vulnerable counties (55.8 [95% CI 50.3-61.2] deaths per 100,000) compared with the group with diverse, urban counties (32.2 [27.3-37.0]) at similar points in the outbreak (76 days since first case). Our findings can inform equitable resource allocation for Covid-19 to allow targeted public health preparedness and response in vulnerable counties.","Khan, S.; McCabe, M.; Krefman, A.; Petito, L.

264,Has the Indian lockdown averted deaths?,"Within the context of SEIR models, we consider a lockdown that is both imposed and lifted at an early stage of an epidemic. We show that, in these models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental models. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and the limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple epidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the Indian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Raju, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20134932v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.20134932v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
265,Foundational research and NIH funding enabling Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for COVID-19,"Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir months after discovery of COVID19 is unprecedented. Typically, decades of research and public sector funding are required to establish the mature body of foundational research requisite for efficient, targeted drug discovery and development. This work quantifies the body of research related to the biological target of remdesivir, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), or parent chemical structure, nucleoside analogs (NcAn), through 2019, as well as NIH funding for this research from 2000 to 2019. There were 6,567 RdRp related publications in PubMed, including 1,263 with NIH support, and 11,073 NcAn-related publications, including 2,319 with NIH support. NIH support for RdRp research comprised 2,203 Project Years with Costs of $1,875 million. NIH support for NcAn research comprised 4,607 Project Years with Costs of $4,612 million. Research Project grants accounted for 63% and 48% of Project Years for RdRp and NcAn respectively, but only 19% and 12% of Project Costs. Analytical modeling of research maturation estimates that RdRp and NcAn research passed an established maturity threshold in 2008 and 1994 respectively. Of 97 investigational compounds targeting RdRp since 1989, the three authorized for use entered clinical trials after both thresholds.

266,Who is dying from Covid-19 in the United Kingdom? A review of cremation authorisations from a single South Wales' crematorium.,"Abstract Background: Covid 19 is pandemic in the UK. To date only studies in the UK on hospital deaths have been published in the peer reviewed literature. Legal requirements for cremation in England and Wales require the collection of information that can be used to improve understanding of Covid 19 deaths in both hospital and community settings. Aim: To document demographic and clinical characteristics, including likely place of infection, of individuals dying of Covid 19 to inform public health policy Design: A comprehensive case series of deaths from Covid 19 between 6 April and 30 May. Setting: A crematorium in South Wales Participants: Individuals for whom an application was made for cremation. Main outcome measures: Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities, where infection acquired. Results: Of 752 cremations, 215(28.6%) were Covid-19 of which 115 (53.5%) were male and 100 (46.5%) female. The median age was 82 years, with the youngest patient being 47 years and the oldest 103 years. Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.03 -3.74, p=0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21(9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in nursing homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital(median 88y (IQ range 82-93y) v 80y (IQ range 71-87y): p<0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in nursing homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 v. 1: IQ range 1-2: p <0.001). Conclusions: In a representative series, comprising both hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average 2 comorbidities predominated.

267,Global Assessment of the Relationship between Government Response Measures and COVID-19 Deaths,"Objective: To provide an early global assessment of the impact of government stringency measures on the rate of growth in deaths from COVID-19. We hypothesized that the overall stringency of a government's interventions and the speed of implementation would affect the growth and level of deaths related to COVID-19 in that country. Design: Observational study based on an original database of global governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 170 countries from January 1, 2020 until May 27, 2020 by a team of researchers at Oxford University, UK. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0-100). Regression was used to show correlations between the speed and strength of government stringency and deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Interventions: Nine non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school and work closures, restrictions on international and domestic travel, public gathering bans, public information campaigns, as well as testing and contact tracing policies. Main outcomes measures: The primary outcome was deaths related to COVID-19, measured both in terms of maximum daily deaths and growth rate of daily deaths. Results: For each day of delay to reach an SI 40, the average daily growth rate in deaths was 0.087 percentage points higher (0.056 to 0.118, P<0.001). In turn, each additional point on the SI was associated with a 0.080 percentage point lower average daily growth rate (-0.121 to -0.039, P<.001). These daily differences in growth rates lead to large cumulative differences in total deaths. For example, a week delay in enacting policy measures to SI 40 would lead to 1.7 times as many deaths overall. Conclusions: A lower degree of government stringency and slower response times were associated with more deaths from COVID-19. These findings highlight the importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 as more robust testing, treatment, and vaccination measures are developed.","Hale, T.; Hale, A.

268,Global pattern of COVID-19 research,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, a large number of studies have been conducted in a short period. However, it is unclear whether countries involved in this crisis have made adequate efforts and allocated resources to cutting-edge SARS-CoV-2 research. We analyzed the dynamics of and professional fields represented by papers about this novel coronavirus published before June 15, 2020. High-infection countries produced more scientific output than low-infection countries, and high-income and upper-middle-income countries were the main contributors. However, the research areas overlapped substantially, indicating a waste of resources. Our findings also suggest that international cooperation among countries is still relatively lacking, and all countries should make better use of their strengths to face the epidemic jointly.","Zhu, X.; Jin, Q.; Jiang, X.; Dan, Y.; Zhang, A.; Qiu, G.; Lou, J.; Yu, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146530v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146530v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,True
269,Genetic risk factors for death with SARS-CoV-2 from the UK Biobank,"We present here genetic risk factors for survivability from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). At the time of writing it is too early to determine comprehensively and without doubt all risk factors, but there is an urgency due to the global pandemic crisis that merits this early analysis. We have nonetheless discovered 5 novel risk variants in 4 genes, discovered by examining 193 deaths from 1,412 confirmed infections in a group of 5,871 UK Biobank participants tested for the virus. We also examine the distribution of these genetic variants across broad ethnic groups and compare it to data from the UK Office of National Statistics for increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2. We confidently identify the gene ERAP2 with a high-risk variant, as well as three other genes of potential interest. Although mostly rare, a common theme of genetic risk factors affecting survival might be the inability to launch or modulate an effective immune and stress response to infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Lu, C.; Gam, R.; Pandurangan, A.

This may cause some mathematical models like the one discussed in [2] tend to make errors in the future prediction. We discuss a simple method to better the future prediction in such cases. This method is applied on the active and total cases data for the countries USA and Canada. In the case of Canada, the method succeeded in predicting the date when the active cases began to decrease. In the case of USA, a major improvement in prediction was observed when the method was applied: the predicted active and total cases are 1465602 and 2729015 for June 30; whereas the actual values are 1455400 and 2728856.

271,The reproduction number R for COVID-19 in England: Why hasn't ''lockdown'' been more effective?,"The reproduction number R, the average number of people that a single individual with a contagious disease infects, is central to understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. Values greater than one correspond to increasing rates of infection, and values less than one indicate that control measures are being effective. Here, we summarise how changes in the behaviour of individuals alter the value of R. We also use matrix models that correctly recreate distributions of times that individuals spend incubating the disease and being infective to demonstrate the accuracy of a simple approximation to estimate R directly from time series of case numbers, hospital admissions or deaths. The largest uncertainty is that the generation time of the infection is not precisely known, but this challenge also affects most of the more complex methods of calculating R. We use this approximation to examine changes in R in response to the introduction of lockdown restrictions in England. This suggests that there was a substantial reduction in R before large scale compulsory restrictions on economic and social activity were imposed on 23rd March 2020. From mid-April to mid-June decline of the epidemic at national and regional level has been relatively slow, despite these restrictions (R values clustered around 0.81). However, these estimates of R are consistent with the relatively high average numbers of close contacts reported by confirmed cases combined with directly measured attack rates via close interactions. This implies that a significant portion of transmission is occurring in workplaces; overcrowded housing or through close contacts that are not currently lawful, routes on which nationwide lockdown will have limited impact.","Grant, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144840v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144840v1?rss=1,2020-07-05,2020-07-05,,True

In the absence of a vaccine, a small number of countries have managed to control the diffusion of viruses by early detection and early quarantine. South Korea, one of the countries which have kept the epidemics well-controlled, has opened the infected patients' trajectory to the public. Such a reaction has been regarded as an effective method, however, serious privacy breach cases have been issued in South Korea. Furthermore, some suspected contacts have refused to take infection tests because they are afraid of being exposed. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving contact tracing method based on spatio-temporal trajectory which can be practically used in many quarantine systems. In addition, we develop a system to visualize the contact tracing workflow.","Kim, W.; Lee, H.; Chung, Y.

276,Snapshot of the evolution and mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history. Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhao, J.; zhai, x.; Zhou, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1,2020-07-05,2020-07-05,,False
277,Characterization of Microbial Co-infections in the Respiratory Tract of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"Summary Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues, as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4/13) and 69.2% (9/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking of BCC-associated nosocomial infections are recommended to improve the pre-emptive treatment regimen and reduce fatal outcomes of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

278,"Exposure assessment for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing","Background Evidence for indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating. If SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via aerosols, this has implications for measures taken to limit transmission. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an indoor environment. Methods An exposure assessment model was developed to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets, expelled during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by an infected person in an unventilated indoor environment, and subsequent inhalation by one or more persons. Scenarios encompass a range of virus concentrations, room sizes and exposure times. Results The calculated total volume of expelled aerosol droplets was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough and speaking for 20 minutes, and lastly breathing for 20 minutes. A few to as much as tens of millions of virus particles were expelled. Exposure probability strongly depends on the viral concentration in mucus, as well as on the scenario. Exposure probabilities were generally below 1% at a virus concentration in mucus below 10^5 per mL for all scenarios, increasing steeply at different higher concentrations. According to nose / throat swab data collected from patients, 75%, 50% and 5% of infected individuals carry an estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 per mL mucus of at least 10^5, 10^6 and 10^8, respectively. Discussion Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols generated during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing in an unventilated indoor environment is possible. This study forms a basis to estimate probabilities of exposure to SARS-Cov-2 by airborne transmission in indoor spaces. As long as it is uncertain what fraction of the airborne virus particles is infectious and as long as a dose response relation is lacking, it is recommended to be precautious.","Schijven, J.

279,An Automatic Computer-Based Method for Fast and Accurate Covid-19 Diagnosis,"At present, the whole world is witnessing a horrifying outbreak caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2. It affects its victims respiratory system and causes severe lung inflammation, making it harder for them to breathe. The virus is airborne, and so has a high infection rate. Originated in China last December, the virus has spread across seven continents, affecting the population of over 210 countries, making it one of the fiercest pandemics ever recorded. Despite multiple independent and collaborative attempts to develop a vaccine or a cure, an effective solution is yet to come out. While the disease has put the world in a standstill, detecting the positive subjects and isolating them from the others as soon as possible is the only way to minimize its spread. However, many countries are currently experiencing a massive shortage of diagnostic equipment and medical personals. This insufficiency inspired us to work on a computer-based automatic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect COVID-19 through analyzing Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. The model is capable of identifying the disease with almost 92.5% accuracy. We believe the implementation of this model will help the physicians and pathologists all over the world to single out the victims quickly and thus reduce the prevalence of COVID-19.","Jaid Jim, A.

They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV.

282,Oxygen and mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia: a comparative analysis of supplemental oxygen policies and health outcomes across 26 countries.,"Introduction Hypoxia is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic some countries have reduced access to supplemental oxygen (e.g. oxygen rationing), whereas other nations have maintained and even improved access to supplemental oxygen. We examined whether such variation in the access to supplemental oxygen had any bearing on mortality in COVID-19. Methods Three independent investigators searched for, identified and extracted the nationally recommended target oxygen levels for the commencement of oxygen in COVID-19 pneumonia from the 29 worst affected countries. Mortality estimates were calculated from three independent sources. We then applied linear regression analysis to examine for potential association between national targets for the commencement of oxygen and case fatality rates. Results Of the 26 nations included, 15 had employed conservative oxygen strategies to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. Of them, Belgium, France, USA, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Sweden and the UK guidelines advised commencing oxygen when oxygen saturations (SpO2) fell to 91% or less. Target SpO2 ranged from 92% to 95% in the other 16 nations. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between the national target for the commencement of oxygen and national case fatality rates (Spearmans Rho = -0.622, p < 0.001). Conclusion Our study highlights the disparity in oxygen provision for COVID-19 patients between the nations analysed, and indicates such disparity in access to supplemental oxygen may represent a modifiable factor associated with mortality during the pandemic.","The Gibraltar COVID-19 Research Group: Health Systems,; Goyal, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145763v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145763v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True
283,"Serial interval, basic reproduction number and prediction of COVID-19 epidemic size in Jodhpur, India","Background: Understanding the epidemiology of COVID19 is important for design of effective control measures at local level. We aimed to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number for Jodhpur, India and to use it for prediction of epidemic size for next one month. Methods: Contact tracing of SARSCoV2 infected individuals was done to obtain the serial intervals. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived and epidemic projection was done using R software v4.0.0. Results: From among 79 infector infectee pairs, the estimated median and 95 percentile values of serial interval were 5.98 days (95% CI 5.39 to 6.65) and 13.17 days (95% CI 11.27 to 15.57), respectively. The overall R0 value in the first 30 days of outbreak was 1.64 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.25) which subsequently decreased to 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.09). The instantaneous R0 value over 14 days window ranged from a peak of 3.71 (95% CI 1.85 -2.08) to 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96) as on 24 June 2020. The projected COVID-19 case-load over next one month was 1881 individuals. Reduction of R0 from 1.17 to 1.085 could result in 23% reduction in projected epidemic size over the next one month. Conclusion: Aggressive testing, contact-tracing and isolation of infected individuals in Jodhpur district resulted in reduction of R0. Further strengthening of control measures could lead to substantial reduction of COVID19 epidemic size. A data-driven strategy was found useful in surge capacity planning and guiding the public health strategy at local level.","Saurabh, S.; Verma, M. K.; Gautam, V.; Goel, A.; Gupta, M.

When restrictions are gradually lifted, individual HL becomes essential to control the pandemic and to prevent the resumption of these restriction, should infection numbers surge again. The aim of this rapid scoping review, for which only studies from the general population were considered, was to describe the extent of existing research on HL in the context of previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Facets of HL that were of particular interest were: type of assessment of HL (theory-based versus proxy assessment; validated instrument versus ad hoc assessment), domains of HL, interventions aiming to improve HL during outbreak situations, and HL surveillance during outbreak. METHODS: We searched two major databases and included publications of quantitative and qualitative studies in English and German on any type of research on the functional, critical and communicative domains of HL conducted in the context of the three outbreaks in the general population. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported where and when the study was conducted, the design and method used, and how HL was measured. FINDINGS: 72 studies were included. Three investigated HL or explicitly referred to the concept of HL, 14 were guided by health behaviour theory. We did not find any study designed to develop or psychometrically evaluate pandemic HL instruments, or relate pandemic or general HL to a pandemic outcome, or any controlled intervention study. Type of assessment of the domains of HL varied widely. INTERPRETATION: Theory-driven observational studies as well as interventions, examining whether pandemic-related HL can be improved are needed. In addition, the development and validation of instruments that measure pandemic-related HL is desirable.","Matterne, U.; Egger, N.; Tempes, J.; Tischer, C.; Lander, J.; Dierks, M.-L.; Bitzer, E.-M.; Apfelbacher, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145060v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145060v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True
285,Early COVID-19 Interventions Failed to Replicate St. Louis vs. Philadelphia Outcomes in the United States,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited an abrupt pause in the United States in multiple sectors of commerce and social activity. As the US faces this health crisis, the magnitude, and rigor of their initial public health response was unprecedented. As a response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of approximately one to three months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather, implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our assessments show that while the states mentioned above benefited from the implementations of early preventative measures, they inadequately replicated the desired outcomes observed in St. Louis during the 1918 crisis. Our study indicates that there are other factors, including health disparities that may influence the effectiveness of public health interventions applied. Identifying more specific health determinants may help implement targeted interventions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 and improving health equity.","Jalali, A. M.; Peterson, B.

286,"The mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic onhealthcare workers, and interventions to help them: a rapid systematic review","Background: The covid-19 pandemic has heavily burdened, and in some cases overwhelmed, healthcare systems throughout the world. Healthcare workers are not only at heightened risk of infection, but also of adverse mental health outcomes. Identification of organizational, collegial and individual risk and resilience factors impacting the mental health of healthcare workers are needed to inform preparedness planning and sustainable response. Methods: We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize available research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. On 11 May 2020, we utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, the visualization of a database of 20,738 screened studies, to identify studies for inclusion. We included studies reporting on any type of mental health outcome in any type of healthcare workers during the pandemic. We described interventions reported by the studies, and narratively summarized mental health-related outcomes, as study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. We assessed study quality using design-specific instruments. Results: We included 59 studies, reporting on a total of 54,707 healthcare workers. The prevalence of general psychological distress across the studies ranged from 7-97% (median 37%), anxiety 9-90% (median 24%), depression 5-51% (median 21%), and sleeping problems 34-65% (median 37%). Seven studies reported on implementing mental health interventions, and most focused on individual symptom reduction, but none reported on effects of the interventions. In most studies, healthcare workers reported low interest in and use of professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact with family and friends. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. Discussion: Healthcare workers in a variety of fields, positions, and exposure risks are reporting anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic, but most studies do not report comparative data on mental health symptoms. before the pandemic. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in the current pandemic and their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions. Efforts to help healthcare workers sustain healthy relationships to colleagues, family and friends over time may be paramount to safeguard what is already an important source of support during the prolonged crisis. Expanding interventions' focus to incorporate organizational, collegial and family factors to support healthcare workers responding to the pandemic could improve acceptability and efficacy of interventions.

287,A Novel Approach for Estimating the Final Outcome of Global Diseases Like COVID-19,"The existence of a universal law which maps the bell curve of daily cases to a sigmoid curve for cumulative ones is used for making robust estimations about the final outcome of a disease. Computations of real time effective reproduction rate are presented and its limited usefulness is derived. After using methods ESE and EDE we are able to find the inflection point of the cumulative curve under consideration and study its time evolution. Since mortality processes tend to follow a Gompertz distribution, we apply the properties of it and introduce novel estimations for both the time remaining after inflection time and the capacity of the curve. Special properties of sigmoid curves are used for assessing the quality of estimation and as indices for the cycle completion.

288,The effect of opening up the US on COVID-19 spread,"In response to the pandemic development of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), governments worldwide have implemented strategies of suppression by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Such NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and complete lockdown. Worldwide the NPIs enforced to limit the spread of COVID-19 are now being lifted. Understanding how the risk increases when NPIs are lifted is important for decision making. Treating NPIs equally across countries and regions limits the possibility for modelling differences in epidemic response, as the response to the NPIs influences can vary between regions and this can affect the epidemic outcome, so do the strength and speed of lifting these. Our solution to this is to measure mobility changes from mobile phone data and their impacts on the basic reproductive number. We model the epidemic in all US states to compare the difference in outcome if NPIs are lifted or retained. We show that keeping NPIs just a few weeks longer has a substantial impact on the epidemic outcome.","Bryant, P.; Elofsson, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145649v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145649v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True
289,Profiling pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City,"IMPORTANCE: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are potential sources for transmission; characterization of these cases has not been conducted in most low/middle income countries, including Mexico. OBJECTIVE: To profile pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mexico City, its associated comorbidities and outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study SETTING: Subjects assessed by convenience sampling within the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with and without respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms (RS, NRS, respectively) assessed for SARS-CoV-2 using real time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. OUTCOMES: Severe COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, 30-day mortality and their outcomes in cases RS or NRS and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Amongst 60121 cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 1st, 2020, we identified 5982 cases without RS (9.9%) and 2452 who were asymptomatic at first evaluation (4.1%). Compared to cases with RS, NRS and asymptomatic cases were younger and had lower rates of comorbidities. Cases with NRS had higher rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, ICU admission, and intubation (p<0.001). Mortality was higher for cases with NRS (HR 3.13, 95%CI 1.80-5.45) or RS (HR 7.58, 95%CI 4.56-12.58) compared to asymptomatic cases, adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Predictors for mortality in cases without RS included older age, previous exposure to suspected viral infection cases, comorbidities, presence of NRS and vomiting. For asymptomatic SARS-Co-V-2 infections, chronic kidney disease, previous exposure with suspected infection cases and older age were predictors for lethality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Definition of pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic cases has relevant implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Older age and comorbidity impact on the probability of developing severe complications for cases who were asymptomatic or had only NRS at evaluation and were sent for domiciliary treatment. Extending testing for detection of asymptomatic cases must be considered in Mexico to better understand the impact of the pandemic.","Bello-Chavolla, O. Y.; Antonio-Villa, N.

290,Health-care workers with COVID-19 living in Mexico City: clinical characterization and related outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCWs) have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information about the prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. RESULTS: As of July 2nd, 2020, 34,263 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 10,925 were confirmed (31.9%). Overall, 4,200 were nurses (38.4%), 3,244 physicians (29.7%), 126 dentists (1.15%) and 3,355 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.7%). After follow-up, 992 HCWs required hospitalization (9.08%), 206 developed severe outcomes (1.89%), and 90 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82%). Lethality was recorded in 224 (2.05%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 333 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.05%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcomes compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.","Antonio-Villa, N. E.; Bello-Chavolla, O.

A predictive model of the disease would help allocate medical resources and determine social distancing measures more efficiently. In this paper, we gathered case data from Jan 22, 2020 to April 14 for 6 countries to compare different models' proficiency in COVID-19 cases prediction. We assessed the performance of 3 machine learning models including hidden Markov chain model (HMM), hierarchical Bayes model, and long-short-term-memory model (LSTM) using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The LSTM model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of incidents cases in 4 countries. In contrast, hierarchical Bayes model provided the most realistic prediction with the capability of identifying a plateau point in the incidents growth curve.","Tian, Y.; Luthra, I.; Zhang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145474v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145474v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True
292,Battle with COVID-19 Under Partial to Zero Lockdowns in India,"The cumulative records of COVID-19 are rapidly increasing day by day in India. The key question prevailing in minds of all is when will it get over? There have been several attempts in literature to address this question using time series, Machine learning, epidemiological and statistical models. However due to high level of uncertainty in the domain and lack of big historical data, the performance of these models suffer. In this work, we present an intuitive model that uses a combination of epidemiological model (SEIR) and mathematical curve fitting method to forecast spread of COVID-19 in India in future. By using the combination model, we get characteristics benefits of these models under limited knowledge and historical data about the novel Coronavirus. Instead of fixing parameters of the standard SEIR model before simulation, we propose to learn them from the real data set consisting of progression of Corona spread in India. The learning of model is carefully designed by understanding that available data set consist of records of cases under full, partial to zero lockdown phases in India. Hence, we make two separate predictions by our propose model. One under the situation of full lockdown in India and, other with partial to zero restrictions in India. With continued strict lockdown after May 03, 2020, our model predicted May 14, 2020 as the date of peak of Coronavirus in India. However, in current scenario of partial to zero lockdown phase in India, the peak of Coronavirus cases is predicted to be July 31, 2020. These two predictions presented in this work provide awareness among citizens of India on importance of control measures such as full, partial and zero lockdown and the spread of Corona disease infection rate. In addition to this, it is a beneficial study for the government of India to plan the things ahead.","Babbar, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145664v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145664v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True

294,Tissue-specific tolerance in fatal Covid-19,"Successful host defence against a pathogen can involve resistance or tolerance, with implications for prioritising either antimicrobial or immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Hyper-inflammation occurs in Covid-19 and is associated with worse outcomes. The efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing mortality in critical Covid-19 suggests that inflammation has a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct response to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 requiring enhanced resistance, or an independent immunopathologic process necessitating enhanced tolerance, is unknown. Here we report an aberrant immune response in fatal Covid-19, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, that is not clearly topologically associated with the virus, indicating tissue-specific tolerance of SARS-CoV-2. We found that inflammation and organ dysfunction in fatal Covid-19 did not map to the widespread tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. A monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis was identified in the lung, along with an influx of macrophages/monocytes into the parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses (reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages) were present and dissociated from the presence of virus in lymphoid tissues. Our results support virus-independent immunopathology being one of the primary mechanisms underlying fatal Covid-19. This supports prioritising pathogen tolerance as a therapeutic strategy in Covid-19, by better understanding non-injurious organ-specific viral tolerance mechanisms and targeting aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses.","Dorward, D.

We retrospectively reviewed the data of 15 recurrent-positive patients and 107 control patients with non-recurrent, moderate COVID-19 treated in Wuhan, China. Clinical data and laboratory results were comparatively analyzed. We found that recurrent-positive patients had moderate disease. The rate of recurrent-positive disease in our hospital was 1.87%.

299,Curve-fitting approach for COVID-19 data and its physical background,"Forecast of the peak-out and settling timing of COVID-19 at an early stage should help the people how to cope with the situation. Curve-fitting method with an asymmetric log-normal function has been applied to daily confirmed cases data in various countries. Most of the curve-fitting could show good forecasts, while the reason has not been clearly shown. The K value has recently been proposed which can provide good reasoning of curve-fitting mechanism by corresponding a long and steep slope on the K curve with fitting stability. Since K can be expressed by a time differential of logarithmic total cases, the physical background of the above correspondence was discussed in terms of the growth rate in epidemic entropy.","Nishimoto, Y.; Inoue, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144899v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20144899v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True
300,Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff and patients,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic with devastating social and economic consequences. The extent of the spread of COVID-19 within populations is uncertain since diagnostic tests have not been carried out on all eligible persons and doing such diagnostic tests on everyone is much less feasible in developing countries such as Nigeria. Tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are more affordable, readily available, and require minimal training than current diagnostic tests. Employing a seroepidemiological strategy, serological tests were conducted on 66 volunteering staff and patients at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), a Federal Government owned tertiary healthcare facility, to determine the extent of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, from 17th to 25th June 2020. Using a COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, it was observed that of the 66 samples tested, 5 (7.6%) were both IgG and IgM positive and 17 (26%) were IgG positive. Moreover, for 44 of the 66 participants, simultaneous tests were carried out using a rapid test kit from a different manufacturer but without FDA-EUA and all the results completely matched with the FDA-EUA kit, except one case where the FDA-EUA kit showed positive for both IgG and IgM while the other kit was positive only for IgM. The 26% positive IgG indicates a high exposure rate for the hospital staff and patients and points to community transmission where the facility is situated. Hence, immediate activation of WHO guidelines for controlling community transmission is called for. These results can further serve as a pilot study to guide public health policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic in both the general population and in healthcare settings.","Asuquo, M.

301,The projected impact of mitigation and suppression strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Senegal: A modelling study,"Background: Physical distancing measures that reduce social contacts have formed a key part of national COVID-19 containment and mitigation strategies. Many Sub-Saharan African nations are now facing increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 and there is a need to understand what levels of measures may be required to successfully reduce transmission. Methods: We collated epidemiological data along with information on key COVID-19 specific response policies and health system capacity estimates for services needed to treat COVID-19 patients in Senegal. We calibrated an age-structured SEIR model to these data to capture transmission dynamics accounting for demography, contact patterns, hospital capacity and disease severity. We simulated the impact of mitigation and suppression strategies focussed on reducing social contact rates. Results: Senegal acted promptly to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and as a result has reduced the reproduction number from 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.2) to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), which has slowed but not fully interrupted transmission. We estimate that continued spread is likely to peak in October, and to overwhelm the healthcare system with an estimated 77,400 deaths(95% CI 55,270-100,700). Further reductions in contact rates to suppress transmission (Rt<1) could significantly reduce this burden on healthcare services and improve overall health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Senegal has already significantly reduced transmission. Enhanced physical distancing measures and rapid scale up of hospital capacity is likely to be needed to reduce mortality and protect healthcare infrastructure from high levels of demand.","Thompson, H.

302,"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1,912 university students during March and April 2020. Psychiatric symptoms in the mild or higher range based on clinical cut-offs were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress symptoms, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed some degree of suicidal ideation. We explored factors that may contribute to poor psychological health as well as those that may function as protective factors. Risk and protective factors examined included demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across psychiatric symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Average screen media device usage was 6 hours and usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. Study limitations and implications for treatment and prevention of affective disorders during crisis are discussed.","Sun, S.; Goldberg, S.

303,Firearm Purchasing and Firearm Violence in the First Months of the Coronavirus Pandemic in the United States,"Importance. Firearm violence is a significant public health and safety problem in the United States. A surge in firearm purchases following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may increase rates of firearm violence. Objective. To estimate the association between changes in firearm purchasing and interpersonal firearm violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Design. Cross-sectional time series study. We estimate the difference between observed rates of firearm purchases and those predicted by seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Using negative binomial models, we then estimate the association between excess firearm purchases and rates of interpersonal firearm violence within states, controlling for confounders. Setting. The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Hawaii and Alaska are excluded due to missing or incomplete data. Exposure. The difference between observed and expected rates of firearm purchases in March through May 2020, approximated by National Instant Criminal Background Check System records. Main Outcome and Measure. Fatal and nonfatal injuries from interpersonal firearm violence, recorded in the Gun Violence Archive. Results. We estimate that there were 2.1 million excess firearm purchases from March through May 2020--a 64.3% increase over expected volume, and an increase of 644.4 excess purchases per 100,000 population. We estimate a relative rate of death and injury from firearm violence of 1.015 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.005 to 1.025) for every 100 excess purchases per 100,000, in models that incorporate variation in purchasing across states and control for effects of the pandemic common to all states. This reflects an increase of 776 fatal and nonfatal injuries (95% CI: 216 to 1,335) over the number expected had no increase in purchasing occurred. Conclusions and Relevance. We find a significant increase in firearm violence in the United States associated with the coronavirus pandemic-related surge in firearm purchasing. Our findings are consistent with existing research. Firearm violence prevention strategies may be particularly important during the pandemic.","Schleimer, J. P.; McCort, C. D.; Pear, V.

305,Timing of PCR and Antibody Testing in Patients with COVID-19 associated dermatologic manifestations,"A recent study from Spain noted 40 patients with chilblain-like lesions in suspected COVID-19.1 None tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, but 30% had detectable antibodies. The rapid increase in chilblain/pernio-like cases during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely SARS-CoV-2-associated. The relationship between skin symptom onset and COVID-19 PCR/antibody test timing, however, remains uncharacterized. We established an international registry for cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.2, 3 Providers reported time between dermatologic symptom onset and positive/negative COVID-19 laboratory results, when available. From 8 April-30 June, 2020, 906 laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatologic manifestations were reported, 534 of which were chilblains/pernio.3 Among PCR-tested patients, 57%(n=208) overall and 15%(n=23) of chilblains/pernio cases were PCR-positive. Antibody positivity was 37%(n=39) overall and 19%(n=15) for chilblains/pernio. We evaluated 163 patients with timing information on PCR and/or antibody testing (Table 1). For patients with suspected COVID-19 and any cutaneous manifestation, PCR-positive testing occurred median 6 (IQR 1-14) days after dermatologic symptoms started while PCR-negative testing occurred median 14 (IQR 7-24) days later. For patients with pernio/chilblains, PCR-positivity was noted 8 (IQR 5-14) days after symptoms and negativity median 14 (IQR 7-28) days later. Antibody testing (IgM or IgG) was positive median 30 (IQR 19-39) days after symptom onset for all dermatologic manifestations and 27 (IQR 24-33) days after chilblains/pernio onset. Like Hubiche et al, our data highlight the low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ testing in COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations. Positive predictive values for COVID-19 PCR are influenced by viral shedding kinetics, which are difficult to assess in non-respiratory presentations.4 Our data reveal that early PCR testing is more likely to be positive than later testing, even when date-of-onset is defined by cutaneous manifestations rather than systemic symptoms. Most COVID-19 antibody data are from systemically-ill patients; the kinetics of antibody production in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections remain unclear.5 Here, positive antibodies resulted median 30 days from disease onset, beyond the frequently used 14-21 day testing window. In outpatients with true infection, many factors influence the likelihood of a positive antibody result: antibody production, test availability, assay sensitivity, and timing of care-seeking in relation to symptom-onset. These variables influence our interpretation of individual test results and our understanding of the association between pernio and COVID-19. More population-level testing data is necessary to optimize diagnostic test timing. Positive identification of COVID-19 in minimally-symptomatic patients, including patients with skin findings, is critical to the public health effort.","Freeman, E. E.; McMahon, D. E.; Fox, L.

306,"Sub-epidemic model forecasts for COVID-19 pandemic spread in the USA and European hotspots, February-May 2020","Mathematical models have been widely used to understand the dynamics of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as well as to predict future trends and assess intervention strategies. The asynchronicity of infection patterns during this pandemic illustrates the need for models that can capture dynamics beyond a single-peak trajectory to forecast the worldwide spread and for the spread within nations and within other sub-regions at various geographic scales. Here, we demonstrate a five-parameter sub-epidemic wave modeling framework that provides a simple characterization of unfolding trajectories of COVID-19 epidemics that are progressing across the world at different spatial scales. We calibrate the model to daily reported COVID-19 incidence data to generate six sequential weekly forecasts for five European countries and five hotspot states within the United States. The sub-epidemic approach captures the rise to an initial peak followed by a wide range of post-peak behavior, ranging from a typical decline to a steady incidence level to repeated small waves for sub-epidemic outbreaks. We show that the sub-epidemic model outperforms a three-parameter Richards model, in terms of calibration and forecasting performance, and yields excellent short- and intermediate-term forecasts that are not attainable with other single-peak transmission models of similar complexity. Overall, this approach predicts that a relaxation of social distancing measures would result in continuing sub-epidemics and ongoing endemic transmission. We illustrate how this view of the epidemic could help data scientists and policymakers better understand and predict the underlying transmission dynamics of COVID-19, as early detection of potential sub-epidemics can inform model-based decisions for tighter distancing controls.","Chowell, G.; Rothenberg, R.; Roosa, K.; Tariq, A.; Hyman, J.

Parents worry about the virus (86.4%) vs. CYP (69.4%), whilst (89%) parents are vigilant for symptoms of the virus vs. CYP(69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight-overarching themes: Virus 1)risk of infection, 2)information, guidance and advice, 3)change in health care provision, and 4)fears and anxieties; Lockdown and isolation 5)psychological and social impact, 6)keeping safe under lockdown, 7)provisions and dependence on others, 8)employment and income. Conclusions Parents and CYP were worried about the virus, although CYP less so. Parents and children however, were frustrated with the lack of specific and paediatric focused information and guidance, expressing disappointment with the adult centric information available. Parents also felt alone, especially with their concerns around the implications of cardiac service suspension and the implication for their childs health.

309,"The Impact of COVID-19 on Adjusted Mortality Risk in Care Homes for Older Adults in Wales, United Kingdom: A retrospective population-based cohort study for mortality in 2016-2020","Background: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11,2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81,3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","Hollinghurst, J.; Lyons, J.; Fry, R.; Akbari, A.; Gravenor, M.; Watkins, A.; Verity, F.; Lyons, R.

310,Optimal sample pooling: an efficient tool against SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation has presented multiple imminent challenges to the nations around the globe. While health agencies around the world are exploring various options to contain the spread of this fatal viral infection, multiple strategies and guidelines are being issued to boost the fight against the disease. Identifying and isolating infected individuals at an early phase of the disease has been a very successful approach to stop the chain of transmission. But this approach faces a practical challenge of limited resources. Sample pooling solves this enigma by significantly improving the testing capacity and result turn around time while using no extra resources. However, the general sample pooling method also has the scope of significant improvements. This article describes a process to further optimize the resources with optimal sample pooling.

311,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant D614G increases infectivity and retains sensitivity to antibodies that target the receptor binding domain,"Virus genome sequence variants that appear over the course of an outbreak can be exploited to map the trajectory of the virus from one susceptible host to another. While such variants are usually of no functional significance, in some cases they may allow the virus to transmit faster, change disease severity, or confer resistance to antiviral therapies. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of COVID-19, the virus has spread around the globe, and thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. The rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest for an RNA virus but the enormous number of human-to-human transmission events has provided abundant opportunity for selection of sequence variants. Among these, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant, D614G, was not present in the presumptive common ancestor of this zoonotic virus but was first detected in late January in Germany and China. The D614G variant steadily increased in frequency and now constitutes &gt;97% of isolates world-wide, raising the question whether D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2. Structural models predict that D614G would disrupt contacts between the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike protein and cause significant shifts in conformation. Using single-cycle vectors we showed that D614G is three to nine-fold more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung and colon cell lines, as well as on other human cell lines rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or by ACE2 orthologues from pangolin, pig, dog, or cat. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein retain full neutralization potency. These results suggest that D614G was selected for increased human-to-human transmission, that it contributed to the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, and that it does not confer resistance to antiviral therapies targeting the receptor binding domain.Competing Interest StatementP.C.S. is a co-founder and shareholder of Sherlock Biosciences, and a Board member and shareholder of Danaher Corporation.

312,A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global pathogen1,2, sparking urgent vaccine development efforts with the trimeric spike3,4. However, the inability of antibodies like CR30225, which binds a cryptic spike epitope with nanomolar affinity6, to neutralize virus, suggests a spike-based means of neutralization escape. Here, we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have 10% the unfolding enthalpy of a globular protein at physiological pH, where it is recognized by antibodies like CR3022, and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where it sheds such antibodies, suggesting that the spike evades potentially neutralizing antibody through a pH-dependent mechanism of conformational masking. To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH. In the absence of ACE2, cryo-EM analyses indicated lower pH to reduce conformational heterogeneity. Single-receptor binding domain (RBD)-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH through lowering of RBD and refolding of a pH-dependent switch. Notably, the emerging Asp614Gly strain7 partially destabilizes the switch that locks RBD down, thereby enhancing functional interactions with ACE2 while reducing evasion by conformational masking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhou, T.; Tsybovsky, Y.; Olia, A.

313,Age Matters: COVID-19 Prevalence in a Vaping Adolescent Population - An Observational Study,"Background: Currently, there is limited or no data demonstrating that vaping is associated with increased transmission or prevalence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Our study aims to investigate the relationship of vaping with the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across the United States and in the District of Columbia. Methods: COVID-19 case counts by state and the District of Columbia were obtained via the Worldometers website on 04/30/2020. Prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents were calculated using estimated 2019 population data from the US Census Department. Age ranges analyzed were: high school age children, Ages 18-24, Ages 25-44, and Ages 45-65. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to determine if the rate of vaping was correlated with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. Findings: The Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that persons vaping between 18 years and 24 years of age had a correlation coefficient of 0.278 with prevalence of COVID-19 infection (p=0.048). Vaping high school students had a correlation coefficient of 0.153 with prevalence of COVID-19 (p=0.328). Persons vaping in the age group 25-45 years had a correlation coefficient of 0.101 in association to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.478). And finally, persons vaping between the age 45-65 years old had a correlation coefficient 0.130 with respect to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.364). Interpretation: Increased COVID-19 prevalence is associated with vaping in the adolescent population between ages 18 and 24. Further prospective studies need to be performed in order investigate the severity of outcomes of vaping in association with COVID-19 infection. Funding: Nothing to disclose.","Tandan, N.; Regmi, M.

314,Are Our COVID Warriors Cared-for Enough?A Nationwide Survey on Stress Among Doctors During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Limited and uneven accessibility to healthcare is a major impediment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic which continues on inexorably, across various parts of the globe. We conducted a nationwide survey of a large sample of Indian doctors to measure levels of perceived stress, identify risk factors for severe stress and assess their response to current issues related to safety and well-being of the HCP community. The survey found severely stressed doctors to be younger (<45years), of female gender working in the ICU setting and insecure regarding their finances. Concern regarding PPE shortages and ethical dilemmas of rationing care are factors inducing severe stress amongst doctors working in ICU settings. This is the first such survey done in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from the Indian sub-continent. The findings have important implications on the International healthcare community, especially across Africa, Asia & South America where the contagion continues to wreak havoc. The survey has identified factors which adversely impact the mental health of doctors during this Pandemic. This can act as a valuable guide for governmental authorities, professional organisations and hospital managements to establish support systems at multiple levels for these COVID Warriors.","Nair, A.; Menon, J.; Rammohan, A.; Hakeem, A.

315,Impact of anxiety associated with COVID 19 on tinnitus,"Background We investigated how the anxiety associated with COVID 19 impacts the severity of tinnitus and the outcomes of tinnitus therapy. Methods and Findings A retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between patients from March to April 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. Tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the minimum masking level (MML) measure while anxiety was quantified using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The assessments were repeated after a 2-month interval, in which sound therapy was applied to a subgroup of patients. In all, 94 and 70 cases were reported in the 2020 and 2019 groups, respectively. The effects of the pandemic on emotional status were evident from a higher incidence of anxiety and much higher SAS scores in the 2020 group. There was also an increase in the THI scores in the 2020 group, but the between-year difference was smaller than that of the SAS score. Moreover, there was no between-year difference in MML or the treatment effect, as measured via both THI and MML. Furthermore, the reduction in SAS score in the second assessment was significantly smaller in the 2020 group. However, a positive correlation between the initial SAS score and the improvement was seen within the 2020 group. Conclusions Anxiety increased greatly in tinnitus subjects due to the COVID 19 pandemic. However, this was not associated with an increase in tinnitus severity in 2020. Instead, there was no between-year difference in the THI score or MML or in the improvement of either measure after treatment. The smaller improvement in SAS score and the positive correlation with the initial SAS score in the 2020 group suggests that the SAS score change in this group might largely be due to the natural relief of pressure as the pandemic decelerated in China. Therefore, the anxiety change induced by the COVID 19 pandemic is not likely to have a strong impact on tinnitus.","Xia, L.; Wang, J.; Chuan, D.; Fan, J.; Chen, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True

317,Prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 in a Los Angeles Health System,"With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Chang, T.

318,Kinetics and performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay,"Objectives: To assess the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay across three clinical settings. Methods: Antibody testing was performed on three clinical cohorts of COVID-19 disease: hospitalised patients with PCR confirmation, hospitalized patients with a clinical diagnosis but negative PCR, and symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs). Pre-pandemic respiratory infection sera were tested as negative controls. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated at different time points (<5 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, >20 days, >42 days), and compared between cohorts. Results: Performance of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 assay varied significantly between cohorts. For PCR confirmed hospitalised patients (n = 114), early sensitivity was low: <5 days: 44.4% (95%CI: 18.9%-73.3%), 5-9 days: 32.6% (95%CI, 20.5%-47.5%), 10-14 days: 65.2% (95% CI 44.9%-81.2%), 15-20 days: 66.7% (95% CI: 39.1%-86.2%) but by day 20, sensitivity was 100% (95%CI, 86.2-100%). In contrast, 17 out of 114 symptomatic healthcare workers tested at >20 days had negative results, generating a sensitivity of 85.1% (95%CI, 77.4% - 90.5%). All pre-pandemic sera were negative, a specificity of 100%. Seroconversion rates were similar for PCR positive and PCR negative hospitalised cases. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay increases over time, with sensitivity not peaking until 20 days post symptoms. Performance varied markedly by setting, with sensitivity significantly worse in symptomatic healthcare workers than in the hospitalised cohort. Clinicians, policymakers, and patients should be aware of the reduced sensitivity in this setting.","Hamilton, F.; Muir, P.; Attwood, M.; Noel, A.; Vipond, B.; Hopes, R.; Moran, E.; Maskell, N.; Warwick, D.; Albur, M.; Turner, J.; MacGowan, A.

319,Efficacy of Corticosteroids in Non-Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia from the New York Metropolitan region,"Introduction: The role of systemic corticosteroid as a therapeutic agent for patients with COVID19 pneumonia is controversial. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Methods: This was a single center retrospective cohort study, comprising of 205 patients admitted to the general wards with COVID19 pneumonia. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented. Result: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P=0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P=0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P=0.172), and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2/FiO2 over time. Conclusion: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital death.","Majmundar, M.; Kansara, T.; Lenik, J.

320,Association of SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Load with COVID-19 Patient Outcomes,"Rationale: The Infectious Diseases Society of America has identified the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load for prognostication purposes as a key research question. Objectives: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study among adult patients admitted to the hospital between March 31st to April 10th, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) [&ge;]35), intermediate (25 < Ct < 35), and high (Ct [&le;] 25) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: A composite outcome of death, intubation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used. Secondary outcomes included the severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Main Results: Of 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from March 31st to April 10th, 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21-28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p<0.001), and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, a high genomic load remained an independent predictor of the primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, that above and beyond age, comorbidity, and severity of illness on presentation, may be used to risk-stratify patients, and call for a quantitative diagnostic assay to become available.","Zacharioudakis, I.

321,Reduced inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children presenting to hospital with COVID19 in China,"Background Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children is associated with better outcomes than in adults. The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. Methods We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on CT scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; and interferon (IFN)-gamma; between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations We demonstrated that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or ""cytokine storm"" in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease. These data also imply anti-cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate COVID-19.","Qian, G.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, Y.; Hu, W.; Hall, I.; Yue, J.; Lu, H.; Ruan, L.; Ye, M.; Mei, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145110v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145110v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,True

The goal of our present study was to evaluate which component of clot formation process including endothelial function, platelets aggregation and plasma coagulation, as well as endogenous fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19 correlates with the severity of the disease. We prospectively included 58 patients with COVID-19 and 47 healthy volunteers as a control group that we recruited before the pandemic started. It turns out that plasma coagulation with subsequent platelet aggregation, but not endothelial function, correlates with the severity of the COVID-19.

We used the SIRD (Susceptibles-Infectious-Recovered-Dead) model to describe the past data and to simulate strategies for the gradual mitigation of the epidemic curve by applying non-pharmacological measures. Besides the SIRD model does not include some aspects of COVID-19, as the symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of individuals and the incubation period, for example, in this work we intend to use a classical and easy to handle model to introduce a thorough method of adjustment that allows us to achieve reliable fitting for the real data and to obtain insights about the current trends for the pandemic in each locality. Our results demonstrate that for localities for which the ERN is about 2, only rigid measures are efficient to avoid overwhelming the health care system. These findings corroborate the relevance of keeping the value of the ERN below 1 and applying containment measures early.","Da Silva, R.

Female authors are facing a decrease in papers submission rates since the beginning of the pandemic period. The reasons for this decline in women productivity need to be further investigated. Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science.

326,Plasma IL-6 Levels following Corticosteroid Therapy as an Indicator of ICU Length of Stay in Critically ill COVID-19 Patients,"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven by cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given this unexpected clinical association between post-corticosteroid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Examining single cell RNA-seq data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.","Awasthi, S.; Wagner, T.; Venkatakrishnan, A.; Puranik, A.; Hurchik, M.; Agarwal, V.; Conrad, I.; Kirkup, C.; Arunachalam, R.; O'Horo, J.; Kremers, W.; Kashyap, R.; Morice, W.; Halamka, J.; Williams, A.

Here, we modeled stability of SARS-CoV-2 on skin, paper currency, and clothing to determine if these surfaces may factor in the fomite transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Skin, currency, and clothing samples were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 under laboratory conditions and incubated at three different temperatures (4C, 22C, and 37C). Stability was evaluated at 0 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days, and 14 days post-exposure. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be stable on skin through the duration of the experiment at 4C (14 days). Virus remained stable on skin for at least 96 h at 22C and for at least 8h at 37C. There were minimal differences between the tested currency samples. The virus remained stable on the $1 U.S.A. Bank Note for at least 96 h at 4C while viable virus was not detected on the $20 U.S.A. Bank Note samples beyond 72 h. The virus remained stable on both Bank Notes for at least 8 h at 22C and 4 h at 37C. Clothing samples were similar in stability to the currency with the virus being detected for at least 96 h at 4C and at least 4 h at 22C. No viable virus was detected on clothing samples at 37C after initial exposure. This study confirms the inverse relationship between virus stability and temperature. Furthermore, virus stability on skin demonstrates the need for continued hand hygiene practices to minimize fomite transmission both in the general population as well as workplaces where close contact is common.","Harbourt, D.; Haddow, A.; Piper, A.; Bloomfield, H.; Kearney, B.; Gibson, K.; Minogue, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144253v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.20144253v1?rss=1,2020-07-03,2020-07-03,,True
329,Methodological Rigor in COVID-19 Clinical Research: A Systematic Review and Case-Control Analysis,"Objective: To systematically evaluate the quality of reporting of currently available COVID-19 studies compared to historical controls. Design: A systematic review and case-control analysis Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until May 14, 2020 Study selection: All original clinical literature evaluating COVID-19 or SARS-CoV2 were identified and 1:1 historical control of the same study type in the same published journal was matched from the previous year Data extraction: Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-texts and independently assessed methodological quality using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, QUADAS-2 Score, or case series checklist. Results: 9895 titles and abstracts were screened and 686 COVID-19 articles were included in the final analysis in which 380 (55.4%) were case series, 199 (29.0%) were cohort, 63 (9.2%) were diagnostic, 38 (5.5%) were case-control, and 6 (0.9%) were randomized controlled trials. Overall, high quality/low-bias studies represented less than half of COVID-19 articles - 49.0% of case series, 43.9% of cohort, 31.6% of case-control, and 6.4% of diagnostic studies. We matched 539 control articles to COVID-19 articles from the same journal in the previous year for a final analysis of 1078 articles. The median time to acceptance was 13.0 (IQR, 5.0-25.0) days in COVID-19 articles vs. 110.0 (IQR, 71.0-156.0) days in control articles (p<0.0001). Overall, methodological quality was lower in COVID-19 articles with 220 COVID-19 articles of high quality (41.0%) vs. 392 control articles (73.3%, p<0.0001) with similar results when stratified by study design. In both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, COVID-19 articles were associated with lower methodological quality (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.33, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Currently published COVID-19 studies were accepted more quickly and were found to be of lower methodological quality than comparative studies published in the same journal. Given the implications of these studies to medical decision making and government policy, greater effort to appropriately weigh the existing evidence in the context of emerging high-quality research is needed.

330,Retrospective Clinical Evaluation of Four Lateral Flow Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially life-threatening respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which numerous serologic assays are available. In a CLIA laboratory setting, we used a retrospective sample set (n = 457) to evaluate two lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs; two iterations of Rapid Response COVID-19 Test Cassette, BTNX Inc.) and a subset of to evaluate SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ACON Laboratories (n = 200); and Standard Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo, SD BIOSENSOR (n = 155) for their capacity to detect of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In a cohort of primarily hospitalized patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19, the BTNX assays demonstrated 95% and 92% agreement with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and sensitivity was highest at [&ge;] 14 days from symptom onset [BTNX kit 1, 95%; BTNX kit 2, 91%]. ACON and SD assays demonstrated 99% and 100% agreement with the Abbott assay at [&ge;] 14 days from symptom onset. Specificity was measured using 74 specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and 31 cross-reactivity challenge specimens, including those from patients with a history of seasonal coronavirus infection and was 98% for BTNX kit 1 and ACON and 100% for BTNX kit 2 and SD. Taken with data from EUA assays, these results suggest that LFIAs may provide adequate results for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. Replicating these results in fingerstick blood in outpatient populations, would further support the possibility that LFIAs may be useful to increase access to serologic testing.","McAulay, K.; Bryan, A.; Greninger, A.

331,Association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background The effect of using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) on the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of recent debate. Although studies have examined the potential association between them, the results remain controversial. This study aims to determine the true effect of ACEI/ARBs use on the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Methods Five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, medRxiv preprint server) were retrieved to find eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between ACEI/ARBs use and the risk of infection and clinical outcome of COVID-19. Results 22 articles containing 157,328 patients were included. Use of ACEI/ARBs was not associated with increased risk of infection (Adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01, I2=5.8%) or increased severity (Adjusted OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, I2=27.6%) of COVID-19. The use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with lower risk of death from COVID-19 (Adjusted OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99, I2=57.9%). Similar results of reduced risk of death were also found for ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Adjusted OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.17-0.77, I2=0). Conclusion This study provides evidence that ACEI/ARBs use for COVID-19 patients does not lead to harmful outcomes and may even provide a beneficial role and decrease mortality from COVID-19. Clinicians should not discontinue ACEI/ARBs for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 if they are already on these agents.

333,"HIV and risk of COVID-19 death: a population cohort study from the Western Cape Province, South Africa.","Background: The effect of HIV co-infection on COVID-19 outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Methods: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 death among (i) public sector 'active patients' (at least 1 health visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. Results: Among 3,460,932 public sector patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. In adjusted analysis, HIV increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.70; 2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. increased HIV-associated risk of COVID-19 death remained when restricting to COVID-19 cases (aHR:1.70; 95%CI:132; 2.18) or hospitalized cases (aHR:1.45; 95%CI:1.14; 1.84). Current and previous tuberculosis also increased COVID-19 mortality risk (aHR [95%CI]:2.70 [1.81; 4.04] and 1.51 [1.18; 1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95% CI:1.96; 2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI:6.1; 11.1). Conclusion: HIV was associated with a doubling of COVID-19 mortality risk. While our findings may over-estimate the HIV-associated risk COVID-19 death due to residual confounding, people with HIV should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 management.","Western Cape Department of Health with National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa,; Davies, M.-A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145185v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145185v1?rss=1,2020-07-03,2020-07-03,,True
334,Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19. A randomized clinical trial,"Background After recovery from COVID-19, most patients have anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

340,Orthogonal Functions for Evaluating Social Distancing Impact on CoVID-19 Spread,"Early CoVID-19 growth often obeys: N{t}=N/Iexp[+K/ot], with K/o=[(ln2)/(t/dbl)], where t/dbl is the pandemic doubling time, prior to society-wide Social Distancing. Previously, we modeled Social Distancing with t/dbl as a linear function of time, where N[t]=1exp[+K/A t/(1+ gamma/o t)] is used here. Additional parameters besides {K/o,gamma/o} are needed to better model different rho[t]=dN[t]/dt shapes. Thus, a new Orthogonal Function Model [OFM] is developed here using these orthogonal function series: N(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] g/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , R(Z) = sum[m=0,M/F] c/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z] , where N(Z) and Z[t] form an implicit N[t]=N(Z[t]) function, giving: G/o = [K/A / gamma/o ] , Z[t] = +[ G/o / (1+ gamma/ot) ] , rho[t] = [ gamma/o / G/o ] (Z^2) R(Z) , with L/m(Z) being the Laguerre Polynomials. At large M/F values, nearly arbitrary functions for N[t] and rho[t]=dN[t]/dt can be accommodated. How to determine {K/A, gamma/o} and the {g/m; m=(0,+M/F)} constants from any given N(Z) dataset is derived, with rho[t] set by: c/(M/F - k) = sum[m=0,k] g/m . The bing.com USA CoVID-19 data was analyzed using M/F=(0,1,2) in the OFM. All results agreed to within about 10 percent, showing model robustness. Averaging over all these predictions gives the following overall estimates for the number of USA CoVID-19 cases at the pandemic end: <N/max> = 5,009,677 (+/-) 269,450 (data to 5/3/20), and <N/max> = 4,422,803 (+/-) 162,580 (data to 6/7/20), which compares the pre- and post-early May bing.com revisions. The CoVID-19 pandemic in Italy was examined next. The M/F=2 limit was inadequate to model the Italy rho[t] pandemic tail.

341,Navigating hospitals safely through the COVID-19 epidemic tide: predicting case load for adjusting bed capacity,"Background The pressures exerted by the pandemic of COVID-19 pose an unprecedented demand on health care services. Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. Methods We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). Results The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. Conclusions The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","Donker, T.; Bürkin, F.; Wolkewitz, M.; Haverkamp, C.; Christoffel, D.; Kappert, O.; Hammer, T.; Busch, H.-J.; Biever, P.; Kalbhenn, J.; Bürkle, H.; Kern, W.; Wenz, F.; Grundmann, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143206v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.20143206v1?rss=1,2020-07-03,2020-07-03,,True

Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used to quantify a comprehensive biomarker profile in 105,146 plasma samples collected in the UK Biobank during 2007-2010 (age range 39-70). The biomarkers were tested for association with severe pneumonia (2507 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital or death record occurring during a median of 8.1-year follow-up) and with severe COVID-19 (195 cases, defined as diagnosis in hospital between mid-March to mid-June 2020). A multi-biomarker score was derived for prediction of severe pneumonia based on half of the study population and validated in the other half. We explored how this biomarker score relates to the risk of severe COVID-19. Findings: The biomarker associations with risk of severe COVID-19 followed an overall pattern similar to associations with risk of severe pneumonia (correlation 0.83). The multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 blood biomarkers including inflammatory proteins, fatty acids, amino acids and advanced lipid measures, was strongly associated with risk of severe pneumonia (odds ratio 1.67 per standard deviation [95% confidence interval 1.59-1.76]; 3.8-fold risk increase for individuals in upper vs lower quintile). The multi-biomarker score was also associated with risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.33 [1.17-1.53]; 2.5-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) and remained significant when adjusting for body mass index, smoking, and existing respiratory and cardiometabolic diseases. Mimicking the decade lag from blood sampling to COVID-19, severe pneumonia events occurring after 7-11 years associated with the multi-biomarker score to a similar magnitude (odds ratio 1.43 [1.29-1.59]; 2.6-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile) as for severe COVID-19. However, the short-term risk of severe pneumonia events associated to the multi-biomarker score at even 3 times higher magnitude (odds ratio 2.21 [1.95-2.50]; 8.0-fold risk for upper vs lower quintile in analysis of the first 2 years after blood sampling). Interpretation: In decade-old blood samples from the UK Biobank, a biomarker score measured by high-throughput metabolomics is indicative of the risk for severe COVID-19. The molecular signature of biomarker changes reflective of risk for severe COVID-19 is similar to that for severe pneumonia, in particular when accounting for the time lag to the COVID-19 pandemic. The even stronger association of the biomarker score with 2-year risk for severe pneumonia lends support to promising screening possibilities for identifying people at high risk for severe COVID-19.","Nightingale Health UK Biobank Initiative,; Julkunen, H.; Cichonska, A.; Slagboom, P.

We sought to assess the impact of this large-scale intervention on emergency departments (ED) in Marin County, California. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive and trend analysis of all ED visits in Marin County, California from January 1, 2018 to May 4, 2020 to quantify the temporal dynamics of ED utilization before and after the March 17, 2020 SIP order. Results: The average number of ED visits per day decreased by 52.3% following the SIP order compared to corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019. Both respiratory and non-respiratory visits declined, but this negative trend was most pronounced for non-respiratory admissions. Conclusions: The first SIP order to be issued in the United States in response to COVID-19 was associated with a significant reduction in ED utilization in Marin County.","Bayles, B. R.; George, M.

To study the impact of multimorbidity in the population with COVID-19 infection, we performed a descriptive analysis of a dataset extracted from all reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal until April 28, 2020. We observed a prevalence of multimorbidity in 4.49% of the 19,598 infected patients. Patients showed an increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality with OR 2.70 (CI 95%: 2.52-2.88) for every additional morbidity.

345,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by multicapillary column coupled ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS) of breath. A proof of concept study,"There is an urgent need for screening patients of having a communicable viral disease to cut infection chains. We could recently demonstrate that MCC-IMS of breath is able to identify Influenza-A infected patients. With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we extended our study to the analysis of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. 51 patients, 23m, 28f, aged 64 +/- 16 years, were included in this study. Besides RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs all patients underwent MCC-IMS analysis of breath. 16 patients, 7m, 9f, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. There was no difference in gender or age according to the groups. Stepwise canonical discriminant analysis could correctly classify the infected and non- infected subjects in 98% by cross-validation. Afterwards we combined the Influenza-A sub study and the SARS-CoV-2- sub study for a total of 75 patients, 34m, 41f, aged 64.8 +/- 1.8 years, 14 positive for Influenza-A, 16 positive for SARS-CoV-2, the remaining 44 patients were used as controls. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but inconclusive. There was no imbalance between the groups for age or gender. 97.3% of the patients could be correctly classified to the respective group by discriminant analysis. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination function. Conclusion: MCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath. As this method provides exact, fast non-invasive diagnosis it should be further developed for screening of communicable viral diseases.

346,Bronchoscopy in critically ill COVID-19 Patients: microbiological profile and factors related to nosocomial respiratory infection,"Background: Nosocomial co-infections are a cause of morbidity and mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Objectives: Our aim was to describe bronchoscopy findings and analyse co-infection through bronchial aspirate (BA) samples in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study, analysing the BA samples collected from intubated patients with COVID-19 to diagnose nosocomial respiratory infection. Results: One-hundred and fifty-five consecutive BA samples were collected from 75 patients. Of them, 90 (58%) were positive cultures for different microorganisms, 11 (7.1%) were polymicrobial, and 37 (23.7%) contained resistant microorganisms. There was a statistically significant association between increased days of orotracheal intubation (OTI) and positive BA (18.9 days versus 10.9 days, p<0.01), polymicrobial infection (22.11 versus 13.54, p<0.01) and isolation of resistant microorganisms (18.88 versus 10.94, p<0.01). In 88% of the cases a change in antibiotic treatment was made. Conclusion: Nosocomial respiratory infection in intubated COVID-19 patients seems to be higher than in non-epidemic periods. The longer the intubation period, the greater the probability of co-infection, isolation of resistant microorganisms and polymicrobial infection.

347,Map of SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes not shielded by glycans.,"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, calls for the urgent development of a vaccine. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sikora, M.; von Bülow, S.; Blanc, F.

348,A CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay that is robust against viral evolution and RNA editing,"Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations. Our assay can be completed in 30 minutes with a dipstick for a rapid point-of-care test.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Ooi, K.

Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","Park, C.; Lee, J.; Hassan, Z. U.; Ku, K. B.; Kim, S. J.; Kim, H.

351,"Airway expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and proteases, TMPRSS2 and furin, in severe asthma","Background. Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased. Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels. Conclusion. These key determinants of virus entry into the lungs may contribute to the poorer outcomes from COVID-19 disease in patients with severe asthma.","Kermani, N.; Song, W.-j.; Lunt, A.; Badi, Y.; Versi, A.; GUO, Y.; Sun, K.; Bhavsar, P.; Howarth, P.; Dahlen, S.-E.; Sterk, P.; Djukanovic, R.; Adcock, I.; Chung, K.

Yet, there are vast differences in how quickly governments implemented NPIs. In this paper, we analyze the role of public attention, measured as the share of daily Google searches in a country related to COVID-19, in the timing of the NPI responses. We first show that public attention depends strongly on whether there are cases in own country. We then show that countries with high levels of public attention are more likely to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, even after controlling for the number of cases and deaths. Finally, we show that the extent to which a government responds to public attention is highly dependent on the country's institutional quality. The positive effect of public attention on policy implementation is driven entirely by countries with good institutions.","Aksoy, C.

353,Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA) - an adherence improvement framework: a COVID-19 case study,"Poor adherence to medication is a global phenomenon that has received a significant amount of research attention yet remains largely unsolved. Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a technique for analysing the factors that can cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose the use of Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. This study produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. The results reveal that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). With this information, clinicians can implement relevant measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","Edifor, E.

354,Chopping the tail: how preventing superspreading can help to maintain COVID-19 control,"Disease transmission is notoriously heterogeneous, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings---Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number RE dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, ""chopping off the tail"" to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","Kain, M.

355,Hydroxychloroquine has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 load in nasopharynx of patients with mild form of COVID-19,"Due to the urgent need to stop the spread of the COVID-19 attempts to find the drug with anti SARS-CoV-2 effects among ones already available on a market are actively being made. A number of in vitro as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown that widely used compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is able to cause anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as treatment and prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity change in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found that most of the patients demonstrated gradual decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the swab regardless of the HCQ receiving. Noteworthy that patients with RNA load higher than 106 copies were hospitalized due to condition deteriorating significantly more frequently compared to those with RNA load below 106 copies even with HCQ administration. In addition, the results of the current study indicate that recovering patients may produce viruses at least during 18 days from the onset of symptoms and HCQ therapy does not block or reduce it.","Komissarov, A.; Molodtsov, I.; Ivanova, O.; Maryukhnich, E.; Kudryavtseva, S.; Mazus, A.; Nikonov, E.; Vasilieva, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143289v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143289v1?rss=1,2020-07-03,2020-07-03,,True
356,Do Men and Women Lockdown Differently? An Examination of Panamas COVID-19 Sex-Segregated Social Distancing Policy,"Mobility enables individuals to generate income and is a key input for empowerment and personal autonomy. Curtailment of aggregate social mobility - through policies such as: social distancing recommendations, shelter in place orders and state-enforced lockdowns - has become a primary strategy to address COVID-19 to limit social contact and reduce disease transmission. In this context, a small number of countries have instituted gender or sex-segregated mobility policies (Panama, Peru, and Bogota, Colombia). Through a retrospective analysis of global geographic positioning (GPS) data, this study presents an overview of aggregate mobility in Panama following the countrys implementation of a sex-segregated social distancing policy. Panama was selected as the nationwide sex-segregated policy was enforced throughout the lockdown period. The paper looks at mobility trends on female- and male-sex mobility days, examining differences by volume of movement and type of community locations visited as compared to pre-COVID trends. We find lower visits to all community location categories on female-mobility days. However, we found no significant difference in visits to workplace locations on male- v. female-mobility days. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in three areas: (1) Informal burden of labor and social reproduction, (2) Implications for womens autonomy and safety in the home, and (3) Womens economic empowerment.

The Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) has been strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in multiple diseases. Objective: To assess if elevated RDW is associated with unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively studied clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients for their RDW values. In-hospital mortality was defined as primary outcome, while septic shock, need for mechanical ventilation, and length of stay (LOS) were secondary outcomes. Results- A total of 294 COVID-19 patients were finally studied. Overall prevalence of increased RDW was 49.7% (146/294). RDW was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality (aOR, 4.5; 95%CI, 1.4-14.3) and septic shock (aOR, 4.6; 95%CI, 1.4-15.1) after adjusting for anemia, ferritin, and lactate. The association remained unchanged even after adjusting for other clinical confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No association was found instead with mechanical ventilation and median LOS. Conclusion: Elevated RDW in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and septic shock.","Ramachandran, P.; Gajendran, M.; Perisetti, A.; Elkholy, K.

359,Development of a Synthetic Poxvirus-Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine,"Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated poxvirus vector that is widely used to develop vaccines for infectious diseases and cancer. We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chiuppesi, F.; Werner, M.

360,Hidden genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2: implications for qRT-PCR diagnostics and transmission,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an urgent need to uncover the underlying biology of this devastating disease. Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 clades that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sapoval, N.; Mahmoud, M.; Jochum, M.

361,Early postmortem mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with COVID-19 and correlation to tissue damage,"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease. An investigation of the viral distribution within the human body in correlation to tissue damage can help understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.We present a detailed mapping of viral RNA in 61 tissues and organs of 11 deceased patients with the diagnosis COVID-19. The autopsies were performed within the (very) early postmortem interval (mean: 5.6 hours) to avoid bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Viral loads, blood levels of cytokines, prothrombotic factors as well as macro- and micro-morphology were correlated.Very high (&gt; 104 copies/ml) viral loads were detected in the lungs of most patients and then correlated to severe tissue damage. Intact viral particles could be verified in the lung tissue by transmission electron microscopy. Viral loads in the lymph nodes were associated with a loss of follicular architecture. Viral RNA was detected throughout further extra-pulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage. Inflammatory cytokines as well as the prothrombotic factors were elevated in all patients.In conclusion, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2-RNA throughout the body supports the hypothesis of a maladaptive host response with viremia and multi-organ dysfunction.View Full Text","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Wittschieber, D.; Sanft, J.; Kleemann, S.; Elschner, S.; Haupt, K.

363,Using iCn3D and the World Wide Web for structure-based collaborative research: Analyzing molecular interactions at the root of COVID-19,"ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Youkharibache, P.; Cachau, R.

364,Association between neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and commercial serological assays,"Introduction Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tang, M.

366,Low-Impact Social Distancing Interventions to Mitigate Local Epidemics of SARS-CoV-2,"Background After many jurisdictions have implemented intensive social distancing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the challenge now is to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic without overburdening economic and social activities. This report explores low-impact interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 with a minimum of social and economic disruption. Methods An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington, with agents that interact in homes, schools, workplaces, and other community sites. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions from February-May 2020. Interventions considered were (a) encouraging telecommuting; (b) reducing contacts to seniors and nursing home residents; (c) modest reductions to contacts outside of the home; (d) encouraging self-isolation of persons with COVID-19 symptoms; (e) rapid testing and household quarantining. Results Individual interventions are not expected to have a large impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. No intervention reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by more than 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0% to 13.3%). Removing all interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining the interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy. Conclusions Combining low-impact interventions may mitigate the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, keeping hospital burden within the capacity of the healthcare system. Under this approach SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the community, moving toward herd immunity, while minimizing social and economic disruption.","Jackson, M.

367,Role of pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review,"Abstract Background Since the start of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, pharmacists worldwide are playing a key role adopting innovative strategies to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic. Objectives To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results A total of 1,189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n=4) and China (n=4). The most common type of publication were letters (n=4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n=8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n=7), through one-to-one contact (n=11), telephone (n=6) or video conference (n=5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n=7) as well as patient counseling (n=8). Conclusions A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and-or other pandemic.

368,Temporary Immunity and Multiple Waves of COVID-19,"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe the potential phenomena which may occur if immunity to COVID-19 lasts for a finite time instead of being permanent, i.e. if a recovered COVID-19 patient may again become susceptible to the virus after a given time interval following his/her recovery. Whether this really happens or not is unknown at the current time. If it does happen, then we find that for certain combinations of parameter values (social mobility, contact tracing, immunity threshold duration etc), the disease can keep recurring in wave after wave of outbreaks, with a periodicity approximately equal to twice the immunity threshold. Such cyclical attacks can be prevented trivially if public health interventions are strong enough to contain the disease outright. Of greater interest is the finding that should such effective interventions not prove possible, then also the second and subsequent waves can be forestalled by a consciously relaxed intervention level which finishes off the first wave before the immunity threshold is breached. Such an approach leads to higher case counts in the immediate term but significantly lower counts in the long term as well as a drastically shortened overall course of the epidemic.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

369,Community vulnerability to epidemics in Nepal: A high-resolution spatial assessment amidst COVID-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), the biggest health problem at present, does not have uniform transmission and severity among the countries and communities therein. Knowledge of community vulnerability to the disease would facilitate interventions aimed at transmission control by the efficient deployment of available limited resources. Therefore, we assessed spatial variations and heterogeneity of disease vulnerability among the population in 753 municipal units of Nepal. We collected geospatial indicators representing the domain of socioeconomic inequalities, population dynamics, heterogeneity in the accessibility and the information related to an underlying health condition which potentially affect the severity of COVID-19 transmission. Those indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices using Geographic Information System (GIS); Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two- Social and Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI). The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale and spatially overlaid via equally weighted arithmetic mean. The indices were classified into five level of risk and the municipal units and the population within vulnerabilities classes were quantified and visualized in the map. The index output indicated high vulnerability to epidemics in megacities like Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur, etc.; developing cities especially in the Province No 2; and, municipal units of Karnali and Sudoorpashchim provinces. Additionally, some other municipalities such as Dhulikhel, Beshishahar, Tansen etc. which have a higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders are highly vulnerable. The SVI indicated that 174 municipal units and 41.5% population is highly vulnerable. The EVI identified 55 municipal units and 40.7% of the total population of the country highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The SEVI accounted that disease vulnerability is high in 105 municipal units and 40% population of Nepal. The vulnerability indices created are means for different tiers of the existing government in federal system of Nepal for prioritization and improved planning for disease intervention especially in highly vulnerable municipal units where the COVID-19 transmission could have high severity.","Khanal, L.; Paudel, B.

370,Routine measurement of serum procalcitonin allows antibiotics to be safely withheld in patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Background. It can be a diagnostic challenge to identify COVID-19 patients without bacterial co-infection in whom antibiotics can be safely stopped. We sought to evaluate the validity of a guideline that recommends withholding antibiotics in patients with a low serum procalcitonin (PCT). Methods. We retrospectively collected 28-day outcome data on patients admitted to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, between 5 March and 15 April 2020, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCT within 48 hours of diagnosis. PCT was considered negative if [&le;]0.25ng/ml and positive if >0.25ng/ml. Primary outcomes included antibiotic consumption, mortality, intensive care admission and length of hospital stay. Results. 368 patients met the inclusion criteria; 218 (59%) had a negative PCT and 150 (41%) positive. At 48 hours post-diagnosis, 73 (33%) of those with a negative PCT were receiving antimicrobials compared to 126 (84%) with a positive PCT (p<0.001), with a corresponding reduction in antimicrobial usage over 28 days (median DDD of 3.0 vs 6.8 (p<0.001); median DOT 2 vs 5 days (p<0.001) between the negative and positive PCT groups.) In the negative PCT group, there were fewer deaths (62 (28%) vs. 54 (36%), (p=0.021)) and critical care admissions (19 (9%) vs. 28 (19%), (p=0.007)) than in the positive PCT group. Median length of hospital stay was 8.7 and 9 days in the negative and positive PCT groups respectively. Conclusions. Procalcitonin is a valuable tool in the assessment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, safely reducing the potential burden of unnecessary antibiotic usage.","Williams, E.

371,"Diverse local epidemics reveal the distinct effects of population density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles, and intervention in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide, sparing almost no community. As the disease will likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., ""herd immunity""), while most regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can be facilitated using our online dashboard.","Afshordi, N.; Holder, B.; Bahrami, M.; Lichtblau, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143636v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143636v1?rss=1,2020-07-02,2020-07-02,,True
372,Differential COVID-19 case positivity in New York City neighborhoods: socioeconomic factors and mobility,"New York City has been one of the hotspots of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first two months of the outbreak considerable variability in case positivity was observed across the city's ZIP codes. In this study, we examined: a) the extent to which the variability in ZIP code level cases can be explained by aggregate markers of socioeconomic status and daily change in mobility; and b) the extent to which daily change in mobility independently predicts case positivity. Our analysis indicates that the markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Our analysis also indicates that changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP-level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID-19 case positivity in New York City is largely driven by neighborhood socioeconomic status.","Lamb, M.

373,Transmission Dynamics of the COVID-19 Epidemics in England,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a tremendous health burden and impact on the world economy. As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the net reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands). This study enhances our understanding of the current outbreak and effectiveness of control measures in the UK.","Liu, Y.; Tang, J. W.; Lam, T.

375,ESTIMATING UNDERDIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19 WITH NOWCASTING AND MACHINE LEARNING: EXPERIENCE FROM BRAZIL,"Background: Brazil has the second largest COVID-19 number of cases, worldly. Even so, underdiagnosis in the country is massive. Nowcasting techniques have helped to overcome the underdiagnosis. Recent advances in machine learning techniques offer opportunities to refine the nowcasting. This study aimed to analyze the underdiagnosis of COVID-19, through nowcasting with machine learning, in a South of Brazil capital. Methods: The study has an observational ecological design. It used data from 3916 notified cases of COVID-19, from April 14th to June 02nd, 2020, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We used machine-learning algorithm to classify cases which had no diagnosis yet, producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, we compared the difference between the data without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis at the moment of data extraction. Results: The number of new cases throughout the entire period, without nowcasting, was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (UI95 496-897,025). At the six days period, the number without nowcasting was 19 and 104 (95% UI 60-142) with. The underdiagnosis was 37.29% in the entire period and 81.73% at the six days period. Conclusions: The underdiagnosis was more critical in six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis before the data collection than in the entire period. The use of nowcasting with machine learning techniques can help to estimate the number of new cases of the disease.","Garcia, L. P.; Goncalves, A. V.; de Andrade, M. P.; Pedebos, L. A.; Vidor, A.

376,Exploring Epidemiological Behavior of Novel Coronavirus Outbreak through the Development and Analysis of COVID-19 Daily Dataset in Bangladesh,"Globally, there is an obvious concern about the fact that the evolving 2019-nCoV coronavirus is a worldwide public health threat. The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 triggered a major global epidemic, which is now a major community health issue. As of April 17, 2020, according to Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh has reported 1838 confirmed cases in between 8 March to 17 April 2020, with > 4.08% of mortality rate and >3.15% of recovery rate. COVID-19 outbreak is evolving so rapidly in Bangladesh; therefore, the availability of epidemiological data and its sensible analysis are essential to direct strategies for situational awareness and intervention. This article presents an exploratory data analysis approach to collect and analyze COVID-19 data on epidemiological outbreaks based on first publicly available COVID-19 Daily Dataset of Bangladesh. Various publicly open data sources on the outbreak of COVID-19 provided by the IEDCR, World Health Organization (WHO), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) of Bangladesh have been used in this research. A Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (V-EDA) techniques have been followed in this research to understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in different districts of Bangladesh in between 8 March 2020 to 12 April 2020 and these findings were compared with those of other countries. In all, this is extremely important to promptly spread information to understand the risks of this pandemic and begin containment activities in the country.","Dey, S. K.; Rahman, M. M.; Siddiqi, U.

377,Does Lockdown Decrease the Protective Role of ultraviolet-B (UVB) Radiation in Reducing COVID-19 Deaths?,"Background: Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at large-scale to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation: We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have provided even more substantial health benefits, than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 21% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure while people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns and may support policy decision making in countries imposing such measures.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143586v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143586v1?rss=1,2020-07-02,2020-07-02,,True
378,Data From the COVID-19 Epidemic in Florida Suggest That Younger Cohorts Have Been Transmitting Their Infections to Less Socially Mobile Older Adults,"We analyzed the daily incidence of newly reported COVID-19 cases among adults aged 20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 or more years in the sixteen most populous counties of the state of Florida from March 1 through June 27, 2020. In all 16 counties, an increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence was observed in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, correlate with case incidence. Data on hospitalization and mortality do not support the hypothesis that the observed increase in case incidence was merely the result of liberalization of testing criteria. Parameter estimates from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals. Without such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among older people in Florida would be unsustainable.","Harris, J.

379,SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals are likely expanded by beta-coronaviruses,"The current pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and large progress in understanding the pathology of the virus has been made since its emergence in late 2019. Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Stervbo, U.; Rahmann, S.; Roch, T.; Westhoff, T.

We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Sheffield, UK. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sub-genomic RNA. We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis. Finally variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sub-genomic RNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to tens of thousands of sequences worldwide to provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sub-genomic RNA to date.","Parker, M. D.; Lindsey, B.

381,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for large amounts of diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA, which commercial suppliers are increasingly unable to deliver. In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","Kalnina, L.; Mateu-Regue, A.; Oerum, S.; Hald, A.; Gerstoft, J.; Oerum, H.; Cilius Nielsen, F.; Iversen, A.

382,Discovery of Synergistic and Antagonistic Drug Combinations against SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro,"COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Bobrowski, T.; Chen, L.; Eastman, R.

383,Assessment of Proton-Coupled Conformational Dynamics of SARS and MERS Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases: Implication for Designing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Inhibitors,"Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future ones. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Henderson, J.

384,High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lu, J.; Sun, P.

385,Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundRT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

ConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","Chaix, M.-L.; Wirden, M.; Feghoul, L.; Bertine, M.; Nere, M.-L.; Le Hingrat, Q.; Abdi, B.; Boutolleau, D.; Ferre, V.

386,Attenuated Subcomponent Vaccine Design Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein RNA Binding Domain: In silico analysis,"ABSTRACTThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has previously never been identified with humans, thereby creating devastation in public health. The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector.

387,Early data on the performance of a combined SARS-CoV-2 spike-nucleocapsid antibody lateral flow device compared to a nucleocapsid-only device,"Background There is a critical need for reliable antibody detection methods in order to study and evaluate the public health and clinical response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices offer the prospect of rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), but the performance of these devices must be evaluated for robustness before they can be adopted for routine clinical and public health use.Methods Plasma and serum specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n = 131) and RNA-negative (n = 16) patients were taken from various time points with respect to the onset of symptoms. All 147 anonymised specimens were tested for IgM and IgG using the Hangzhou AllTest 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and the Abbexa COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit.Results IgM sensitivity ranged from 13% to 68%, depending on the date of symptom onset and the device. Regarding IgG, the Abbexa device outperformed the Hangzhou device at all cumulative timeline brackets, with sensitivity of 97·87% (Abbexa) versus 68·09% (Hangzhou) for samples beyond 21 days from symptom onset. Day 21 was therefore chosen as the cut-off for ascertaining test performance characteristics, beyond which the specificity was 100% for both devices and negative predictive value was 0·94 (Abbexa) versus 0·50 (Hangzhou).Discussion Based on this limited dataset, the performance characteristics of the Abbexa LFIA device were substantially better than those of the Hangzhou device. Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device meets the minimum (98%) sensitivity and specificity thresholds set by the UK Medicine &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou that targets only the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Linares, C.

388,Next-generation diagnostics: virus capture facilitates a sensitive viral diagnosis for epizootic and zoonotic pathogens including SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.

MethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.

ResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.

ConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","Wylezich, C.; Calvelage, S.; Schlottau, K.; Ziegler, U.; Pohlmann, A.; Hoeper, D.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False

We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response. Our results accelerate the evaluation and prioritization of new drug development programmes and repurposing of trials to prevent, treat or reduce adverse outcomes.

390,If the link missed：Could inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increase the risk of COVID-19?,"ABSTRACTSince the end of 2019, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emerged globally. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is crucial for SARS-COV-2 entering into the cells. The expression of ACE2 in skin suggested that skin might be a way of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. We found the elevated ACE2 level of patients with psoriasis but downregulated after IL-17 antibody treatment. Further results showed that ACE2 expression increased either in psoriasis or in atopic dermatitis, which were typical inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction. And elevated ACE2 level was also detected in mouse models of dermatitis induced by imiquimod, calcipotriol, repeated tape-stripping or 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) respectively. Moreover, alleviation of cutaneous inflammation with skin recovery moisture also lowered expression of ACE2 in mouse models with barrier deteriorated inflammatory skin disorders. Furthermore, inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increased the penetration of topical FITC conjugated spike protein into the skin. Conversely, improvement in skin permeability barrier could prevent this penetration. Thus, indicating the special link between inflammatory skin disorders with skin barrier dysfunction and increasing risk of COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xu, Q.; Chen, L.; Zhang, L.; Li, X.; Zheng, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False
391,Identification of peptide candidate against COVID-19 through reverse vaccinology: An immunoinformatics approach,"Novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is emerging as a pandemic situation and declared as a global health emergency by WHO. Due to lack of specific medicine and vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

392,Fourier spectral density of the coronavirus genome,"We present an analysis of the coronavirus RNA genome via a study of its Fourier spectral density based on a binary representation of the nucleotide sequence. We find that at low frequencies, the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations. Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values and exhibits no other peaks apart from one associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent that characterizes the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.","Tan, H.

393,Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from North Africa: viral origins and mutational spectrum,"In Morocco two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded. The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.

At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.

Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries.

The spike (S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). A 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycan-dependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain involving multiple protomers.

396,Mutations from bat ACE2 orthologs markedly enhance ACE2-Fc neutralization of SARS-CoV-2,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","Mou, H.; Quinlan, B.; Peng, H.; Guo, Y.; Peng, S.; Zhang, L.; Davis-Gardner, M.; Gardner, M.; Voo, Z.

The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","Malimova, M.; Sidhom, E.-H.; Satyam, A.; Dvela-Levitt, M.; Melanson, M.; Chamberlain, B.

406,Anti-frameshifting ligand active against SARS coronavirus-2 is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins. Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress −1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of −1 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Neupane, K.; Munshi, S.; Zhao, M.; Ritchie, D.

407,Structure of the full SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected cells,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models. The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lan, T.

408,Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-EM,"The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xu, C.; Wang, Y.; Liu, C.; Zhang, C.; Han, W.; Hong, X.; Wang, Y.; Hong, Q.; Wang, S.; Zhao, Q.; Wang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Chen, K.; Zheng, W.; Kong, L.; Wang, F.; Zuo, Q.; Huang, Z.; Cong, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False
409,SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Human Lung Alveolar Type 2 Cells Elicits a Rapid Epithelial-Intrinsic Inflammatory Response,"ABSTRACTThe most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Huang, J.; Hume, A.

410,Phosphorylation modulates liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1–3. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7–11. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12–15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Carlson, C.

Severe symptoms include viral pneumonia secondary to infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, in some cases causing death. We developed primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of proximal airway epithelium and 3D organoid cultures of alveolar epithelium were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response. We validated the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirming that Remdesivir strongly suppressed viral infection/replication.

415,Rational Design of the Remdesivir Binding Site in the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Potential Resistance,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery.

416,Role of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different cohorts: Can they provide clues for appropriate patient triaging?,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global health crisis. Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay.

We systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.

419,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and boosts proinflammatory activity,"ABSTRACTThere is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 g/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 g/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication ({Delta}CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","Altaf, I.; Nadeem, M.

421,Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein in Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and its possible implications in SARS CoV-2 related studies,"Recently, the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been demonstrated as a clinically relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin□converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Suresh, V.; Parida, D.; Minz, A.

422,SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathological damage and constitutes an antiviral target,"Cytokine storm and multi-organ failure are the main causes of SARS-CoV-2-related death. However, the origin of the virus excessively damaging abilities remains unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is sufficient to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damage in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 2-E protein induced rapid pyroptosis-like cell death in various susceptible cells and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen. Overexpressed 2-E protein formed cation channels in host cell membranes, eventually leading to membrane rupture. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, their channel inhibition, cell protection and antiviral activities were positively correlated with each other, supporting 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Gao, Z.; Xia, B.; Shen, X.; He, Y.; Pan, X.; Wang, Y.; Yang, F.; Fang, S.; Wu, Y.; Zuo, X.; Xie, Z.; Jiang, X.; Chi, H.; Meng, Q.; Zhou, H.; Zhou, Y.; Cheng, X.; Cheng, T.; Xin, X.; Jiang, H.; Xiao, G.; Zhao, Q.; Zhang, L.-K.; Shen, J.; Li, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
423,Comprehensive annotations of the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a fast and accurate pipeline,"In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain). We believe this will aid in the surveillance of any proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever-increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.","Rahman, M.

424,Angiotensin-(3-4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection,"The renal lesions – including severe acute kidney injury – are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Luzes, R.; Muzi-Filho, H.; Pereira-Acacio, A.; Crisostomo, T.; Vieyra, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
425,Perversely expressed long noncoding RNAs can alter host response and viral proliferation in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundSince December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.

ResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.

ConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","Turjya, R.

426,"Integrate Structural Analysis, Isoform Diversity, and Interferon-Inductive Propensity of ACE2 to Refine SARS-CoV2 Susceptibility Prediction in Vertebrates","The current new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused globally near 0.4/6 million confirmed deaths/infected cases across more than 200 countries. As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, E.

427,A facile Q-RT-PCR assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has infected millions within just a few months and is continuing to spread around the globe causing immense respiratory disease and mortality. Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.

ImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.","Shema Mugisha, C.; Vuong, H.

428,Critical Sequence Hot-spots for Binding of nCOV-2019 to ACE2 as Evaluated by Molecular Simulations,"The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious.","Ghorbani, M.; Brooks, B.

429,Modified Vaccinia Ankara Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Expressing Full-Length Spike Induces Strong Neutralizing Antibody Response,"There is a great need for the development of vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Routhu, N.

Detection of the viral genome through RT-qPCR is the golden standard for this test, however, the high demand of the materials and reagents needed to sample individuals, purify the viral RNA, and perform the RT-qPCR test has resulted in a worldwide shortage of several of these supplies. Here, we show that directly lysed saliva samples can serve as a suitable source for viral RNA detection that is cheaper and can be as efficient as the classical protocol that involves column purification of the viral RNA.

431,Binding Ability Prediction between Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Reveals the Adaptive Strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in Humans,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.","Xue, X.; Shi, J.; Xu, H.; Qin, Y.; Yang, Z.; Feng, S.; Liu, D.; Jian, L.; Hua, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Huang, X.; Zhang, X.; Li, X.; Chen, C.; Guo, J.; Tang, W.; Liu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1,2020-06-27,2020-06-27,,False

S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface.

However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed because of privacy legislation. To facilitate integration of any omics data from any data owner world-wide without violating privacy laws, we here introduce Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized machine learning approach uniting edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination as well as privacy protection without the need for a central coordinator thereby going beyond federated learning. Using more than 14,000 blood transcriptomes derived from over 100 individual studies with non-uniform distribution of cases and controls and significant study biases, we illustrate the feasibility of SL to develop disease classifiers based on distributed data for COVID-19, tuberculosis or leukemias that outperform those developed at individual sites.

This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits, as well with a simple heat and detergent method. Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.","Barclay, R.

436,In situ structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals flexibility mediated by three hinges,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is required for cell entry and is the major focus for vaccine development. We combine cryo electron tomography, subtomogram averaging and molecular dynamics simulations to structurally analyze S in situ. Compared to recombinant S, the viral S is more heavily glycosylated and occurs predominantly in a closed pre-fusion conformation. We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges that give the globular domain unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of safe vaccines. The large scale tomography data set of SARS-CoV-2 used for this study is therefore sufficient to resolve structural features to below 5 Ångstrom, and is publicly available at EMPIAR-10453.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","Turonova, B.; Sikora, M.; Schürmann, C.; Hagen, W.

437,Neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 revealed in a human brain organoid model,"Although COVID-19 is considered to be primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Reports indicate that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from CNS symptoms. Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of infection are. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection of human brain organoids, clear evidence of infection was observed, with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons. Further, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Finally, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV2, and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV2.","Song, E.; Zhang, C.; Israelow, B.; Lu, P.; Weizman, O.-E.; Liu, F.; Dai, Y.; Szigeti-Buck, K.; Yasumoto, Y.; Wang, G.; Heltke, J.; Ng, E.; Wheeler, J.; Alfajaro, M.

438,Glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Control the Receptor Binding Domain Conformation,"The glycan shield of the beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) Spike (S) glycoprotein provides protection from host immune responses, acting as a steric block to potentially neutralizing antibody responses. The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Henderson, R.; Edwards, R.

439,Using the nucleocapsid protein to investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses,"An initial outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has resulted in a massive global pandemic causing well over 10,000,000 cases and 500,000 deaths worldwide. The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the {beta}-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (37S and 267A) were found to exist only in its N protein, along with an extended {beta}-hairpin in the N-Terminal Domain. Collectively, this study strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789, providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein found in these coronaviruses. Furthermore, this data will help enhance our understanding of the complete history behind SARS-CoV-2 and help assist in antiviral and vaccine development.","Schuster, N.

Indoor locations are more likely environments for the diffusion of the virus contagion among people, but direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in air or on surfaces is quite sparse, especially regarding public transport. In fact, an important demand is to know how and if it is safe to use them. To understand the possible spreading of COVID-19 inside a city bus during normal operation and the effectiveness of the protective measures adopted for transportation, we analysed the air and the surfaces most usually touched by passengers.

441,Tipiracil binds to uridine site and inhibits Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease with C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family. It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme’s active site, providing basis for the uracil scaffold-based drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Kim, Y.; Wower, J.; Maltseva, N.; Chang, C.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Wilamowski, M.; Kang, S.; Nicolaescu, V.; Randall, G.; Michalska, K.; Joachimiak, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False

We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamic simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on ACE2 receptor glycosylation that, taken together, can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.","Zhao, P.; Praissman, J.

Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.

Author summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection.

446,Elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of cystine and theanine through transcriptome analysis of mice and comparison with COVID-19 gene set data,"ABSTRACTWe previously showed that oral administration of cystine and theanine (CT) to mice confers resistance to influenza virus infection. In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Mitsui, A.; Sakai, R.; Miwa, K.; Shibahara, S.; Kurihara, S.; Nagao, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False
447,Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane,"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Wang, J.; Fortoul, N.; Zhang, X.

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses.

A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6/6B compared to healthy lungs.

451,Increased Expression of Chondroitin Sulfotransferases following AngII may Contribute to Pathophysiology Underlying Covid-19 Respiratory Failure: Impact may be Exacerbated by Decline in Arylsulfatase B Activity,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to respiratory epithelium through the ACE2 receptor, an endogenous receptor for Angiotensin II (AngII). The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets.","Bhattacharyya, S.; Kotlo, K.; Tobacman, J.

452,Chasing the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada's COVID-19 cases: A genomics study,"The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has had profound social and economic consequences and has shed light on the importance of continued and additional investment in global health and infectious disease surveillance. Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","Sjaarda, C.

453,The discovery of potential natural products for targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by virtual screening,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters into the cells through its spike proteins binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein and causes virus infection in host cells. Until now, there are no available antiviral drugs have been reported that can effectively block virus infection. The study aimed to discover the potential compounds to prevent viral spike proteins to bind to the human ACE2 proteins from Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds (TDEC) by structure-based virtual screening. In this study, to rapidly discover potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the molecular docking calculation was performed by AutoDock Vina program. Herein, we found that 39 potential compounds may have good binding affinities and can respectively bind to the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in the prefusion conformation and spike-ACE2 complex protein in silico. Among those compounds, especially natural products thioflexibilolide A and candidine that were respectively isolated from the soft corals Sinularia flexibilis and Phaius mishmensis may have better binding affinity than others. This study provided the predictions that these compounds may have the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from entry into cells.","Wu, Y.-C.; Chen, G.-Y.; Yao, T.-Y.; Ahmed, A.; Pan, Y.-C.; Yang, J.-C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170639v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170639v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False
454,Antiviral Drug Screen of Kinase inhibitors Identifies Cellular Signaling Pathways Critical for SARS-CoV-2 Replication,"Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

455,Molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 structural genes: evidence of positive selection in spike glycoprotein,"SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in early 2020 and has resulted in more than 8,000,000 infections as well as 430,000 deaths in the world so far. Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","Zhan, X.-Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhou, X.; Huang, K.; Qian, Y.; Leng, Y.; Yan, L.; Huang, B.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False

Sixty-eight samples were positive for more than one assay and one genetic locus and were defined as true positive samples.

457,"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs","BackgroundThe newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.

MethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

ResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

459,CoronaHiT: large scale multiplexing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Nanopore sequencing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started in China in late 2019. Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 24 samples at a time. There is a need for a higher throughput method to reduce cost per genome. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 95 small genomes on a single Nanopore flowcell, which uses transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of symmetric barcodes. We demonstrate the method using 48 and 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per flowcell, amplified using the ARTIC protocol, and compare performance with Illumina and ARTIC ONT sequencing. Results demonstrate that all sequencing methods produce inaccurate genomes when the RNA extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical sample has a cycle threshold (Ct) >= 32. Results from set same set of 23 samples with a broad range of Cts show that the consensus genomes have >90% coverage (GISAID criteria) for 78.2% of samples for CoronaHiT-48, 73.9% for CoronaHiT-94, 78.2% for Illumina and 73.9% for ARTIC ONT, and all have the same clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per nanopore flowcell without compromising the quality of the resulting genomes while reducing library preparation complexity and significantly reducing cost. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.","Baker, D. J.; Kay, G. L.; Aydin, A.; Le-Viet, T.; Rudder, S.; Tedim, A.

460,SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human fetal and pediatric gastric organoids,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global public health emergency. COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Giobbe, G.

The power inherent in publicly available data can be demonstrated via comparative transcriptome analyses. In the current study, we collected high-throughput gene expression data related to human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses (SARS, H1N1, rhinovirus, avian influenza, and Dhori) and compared the effect of these viruses on the human transcriptome. The analyses identified fifteen genes specifically expressed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2; these included CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and S100A8 and S100A9 (calcium-binding proteins), all of which are involved in lung/respiratory disorders. The analyses showed that genes involved in the Type1 interferon signaling pathway and the apoptosis process are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Furthermore, results of protein-protein interaction analyses were consistent with a functional role of CSF2 in COVID-19 disease.

462,"Pixatimod (PG545), a clinical-stage heparan sulfate mimetic, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus","A major global effort is currently ongoing to search for therapeutics and vaccines to treat or prevent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Repurposing existing entities is one attractive approach. The heparan sulfate mimetic pixatimod is a clinical-stage synthetic sulfated compound that is a potent inhibitor of the glycosidase heparanase, and has known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and also antiviral properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and alters its conformation. Notably, this site overlaps with the known ACE2 binding site in the S1 RBD. We find that pixatimod inhibits binding of recombinant S1 RBD to Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, in assays with three different isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus we show that pixatimod effectively inhibits viral infection of Vero cells. Importantly, its potency is well within its safe therapeutic dose range. These data provide evidence that pixatimod is a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. Together with its other known activities this provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation as a new multimodal therapeutic for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Guimond, S.

Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection.

It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions.

465,Lung expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules and antiviral restriction factors: interindividual differences are associated with age and germline variants,"Germline variants in genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2) may influence the susceptibility to infection, as may polymorphisms in genes involved in the innate host response to viruses (e.g. APOBEC3 family). We searched for polymorphisms acting, in lung tissue, as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, whose expression levels did not associate with either sex or age of the 408 patients whose non-diseased lung tissue was analyzed. Instead, we identified seven cis-eQTLs (FDR<0.05) for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G (rs139296, rs9611092, rs139331, rs8177832, rs17537581, rs61362448, and rs738469). The genetic control of the expression of APOBEC3 genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication, may explain interindividual differences in risk or severity of viral infections. Future studies should investigate the role of host genetics in COVID-19 patients using a genome-wide approach, to identify other genes whose expression levels are associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

Author summaryIdentification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has become commonplace in functional studies on the role of individual genetic variants in susceptibility to diseases. In COVID-19, it has been proposed that individual variants in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and innate host response genes may influence the susceptibility to infection. We searched for polymorphisms acting, in non-diseased lung tissue of 408 patients, as eQTLs for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. Seven cis-eQTLs were detected for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes.

466,"Development of a fluorescence based, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay","In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.

IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Froggatt, H. M.; Heaton, B. E.; Heaton, N.

468,N-glycosylation network construction and analysis to modify glycans on the spike S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.,"Background The spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is N-glycosylated. The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies. Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine development work.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Krishnan, S.; Krishnan, G.

469,"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization","STUDY QUESTIONIs SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) expressed in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and does it participate in endometrial decidualization?

SUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).

LARGE SCALE DATAN/A.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

470,Intestinal receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in inflamed IBD tissue is downregulated by HNF4A in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon,"Patients with IBD are considered immunosuppressed, but do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19. Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.

We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.

Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.","Verstockt, B.; Verstockt, S.; Adbu Rahiman, S.; Ke, B.-J.; Arnauts, K.; Cleynen, I.; Sabino, J.; Ferrante, M.; Matteoli, G.; Vermeire, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,,False
471,A nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 for rapid neutralization testing and screening of anti-infective drugs for COVID-19,"A high-throughput platform would greatly facilitate COVID-19 serological testing and antiviral screening. Here we report a nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. We demonstrate that the optimized reporter virus assay in Vero E6 cells can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera and produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluated a collection of approved and investigational antivirals and other anti-infective drugs. Nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat were identified as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 M). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 M.

Here, we report identification of CD209L/L-SIGN and a related protein, CD209/DSIGN as alternative receptors capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed a prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelial and endothelial cells of small and medium-sized vessels, whereas CD209 was detected only in a limited number of cell types. Biochemical assays revealed that ectopically expressed CD209L and CD209 bind to S-RBD and mediate SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped virus entry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human endothelial cells endogenously express CD209L and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Soluble CD209L-Fc neutralized virus entry. Our observations show that CD209L and CD209 serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in disease-relevant cell types, including the vascular system.

To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from [~]0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.","Zhou, T.; Teng, I.-T.; Olia, A.

476,Climatic-niche evolution of SARS CoV-2,"Adaptation of species to new environments is governed by natural selection that discriminates among genetic variations and favors survival of the fittest. Here, we propose climate plays an important role in the evolution of SARS CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 all over the world which was previously not known. To understand the climatic factors responsible for shaping the molecular determinants of the novel coronavirus, genotyping SARS CoV-2 across different latitudes and Koppens climate is imperative. It seems this virus follows inverse latitudinal biodiversity gradient due to its preference towards Koppens temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed division of 176 SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2, well defined by four mutations. Initially, SARS CoV-2 was restricted to a ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) climate of southeast China, which soon spread all over the world having C climate. Genomic information superimposed on global Koppens climate map elucidates that the gradation ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) and ""marine-temperate"" (Cfb) to ""humid-continental"" (Dfa-Dfb) climate drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. It seems an early infection in Europe and USA is due to the dominance of C climate. Russia and North America were infected through linkage of C to D climate and South America from C to A climate. Our study elucidates viruses are sensitive to climate and combined genomic and climatic studies provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways during a pandemic which will enable us to take pre-emptive precautionary measures in such outbreaks.

477,Loss of pH switch unique to SARS-CoV2 supports unfamiliar virus pathology,"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","Camacho, C.

However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, A.

Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","Karathanou, K.; Lazaratos, M.; Bertalan, E.; Siemers, M.; Buzar, K.; Schertler, G.

481,An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (""priming"") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases. Nafamostat and camostat are currently in clinical trials against COVID19. The rank order potency for the three inhibitors is: nafamostat (IC50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC50 = 6.2 nM) and gabexate (IC50 = 130 nM). Further profiling of these three inhibitors against a panel of proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","Shrimp, J. H.; Kales, S. C.; Sanderson, P.

The extent and distribution of ACE-2 has been associated with the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. Here we show by immunofluorescence analysis that the ACE2 is abundantly expressed in oral mucosa, particularly in the surface epithelial cells suggesting that these cells could represent sites of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Further, together with the reports on ACE2 ectodomain shedding, we discuss the rationale for the hypothesis that the ACE-2 measurement in saliva could be a marker for COVID-19 infection during early phase following SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","Srinivasan, M.; Zunt, S.

483,Modeling the effect of COVID-19 disease on the cardiac function: a computational study,"ABSTRACTBackground The effect of COVID-19 on the cardiac function and on the vascular system increases the morbidity and mortality of infected subjects with cardiovascular diseases.Objectives To provide preliminary results on cardiac global outcomes (such as cardiac output, ventricular pressures) obtained by means of computational models in plausible scenarios characterized by COVID-19.Methods We considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system, which models, from the mechanical point of view, the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through mathematical equations of the underlying physical processes. To study the effect of COVID-19, we varied in suitable ranges the heart rate, the contractility and the pulmonary resistances.Results Our computations on individuals with both otherwise normal and impaired cardiac functions revealed that COVID-19 worsen cardiac function, as shown by a decrease of some cardiac biomarkers values such as cardiac output and ejection fraction. In the case of existing impaired cardiac function, the presence of COVID-19 lead to values outside the normal ranges.Conclusions Computational models revealed to be an effective tool to study the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Such effect could be significant for patients with impaired cardiac function. This is especially useful to perform a sensitivity analysis of the hemodynamics for different conditions.CONDENSED ABSTRACT Emerging studies address how COVID-19 infection might impacts the cardiovascular system. This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients. By the assessment of conventional important biomarkers obtained with new sources as a 0-dimentional computational model, we propose a new study protocol as an effective method to evaluate short-term prognosis. The clinical protocol proposed will help to rapidly identify which patients require intensive monitoring, diagnostic strategy and most adequate therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.ABBREVIATION LISTHRHeart RateEDVEnd Diastolic VolumeESVEnd Systolic VolumeCOCardiac OutputSVStroke VolumeEFEjection FractionDBP(Systemic) Diastolic Blood PressureSBP(Systemic) Systolic Blood PressurePAPPulmonary artery pressureView Full Text","Regazzoni, F.; Vergara, C.; Dede', L.; Zunino, P.; Guglielmo, M.; Scrofani, R.; Fusini, L.; Cogliati, C.; Pontone, G.; Quarteroni, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166421v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166421v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
484,"Scalable, rapid and highly sensitive isothermal detection of SARS-CoV-2 for laboratory and home testing","Global efforts to monitor and contain the Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, currently rely on RT-qPCR-based diagnostic assays. Yet their high cost, moderate throughput, and dependence on sophisticated equipment limit a broad implementation. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an alternative detection method that has the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we established a robust, highly sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay that is insensitive to carry-over contaminations. Our approach uses a rapid upfront lysis step and hydroxy-naphthol-blue (HNB) for colorimetric detection, which enables the robust identification of Covid-19 infections from a variety of sample types within 30 minutes. By combining RT-LAMP with a simple nucleic acid enrichment method (bead-LAMP), we profoundly increased assay sensitivity to RT-qPCR-like levels, thereby extending applications to large-scale pooled testing. Finally, we developed HomeDip-LAMP for pipette-free SARS-CoV-2 detection for low-resource environments. Our combined optimizations set the stage for implementing RT-LAMP as SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics assay for population-wide and home-based testing.","Kellner, M. J.; Ross, J. J.; Schnabl, J.; Dekens, M. P.

485,"RAAS blockade, kidney disease, and expression of ACE2, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in kidney epithelial and endothelial cells","SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells. Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney. ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of ACEi/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi/ARB use in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease. Our study illuminates the dynamics of ACE2 expression in specific kidney cells, with implications for SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenicity.","Subramanian, A.; Vernon, K.; Slyper, M.; Waldman, J.; Luecken, M.

486,"Green tea and Spirulina extracts inhibit SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 spike pseudotyped virus entry in vitro","Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of animals and birds. Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.","Joseph, J.; Thankamani, K.; Ajay, A.; Das, V. R. A.; Raj, V.

487,"Accommodating individual travel history, global mobility, and unsampled diversity in phylogeography: a SARS-CoV-2 case study.","Spatiotemporal bias in genome sequence sampling can severely confound phylogeographic inference based on discrete trait ancestral reconstruction. This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.","Lemey, P.; Hong, S.; Hill, V.; Baele, G.; Poletto, C.; Colizza, V.; O'Toole, A.; McCrone, J.

488,Systemic analysis of putative SARS-CoV-2 entry and processing genes in cardiovascular tissues identifies a positive correlation of BSG with age in endothelial cells,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread throughout the world with unprecedented global healthcare and socio-economic consequences. There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19 characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four important observations: (i)Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2 and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic. Finally, because BSG is functions in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis, our observations may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with aging.","Ahmetaj-Shala, B.; Vaja, R.-K.; Atanur, S.

We directly visualized double-stranded RNA within double-membrane vesicles, forming a loosely organized network with frequent RNA branching consistent with template-directed RNA synthesis intermediates.

490,ViralLink: An integrated workflow to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on intracellular signalling and regulatory pathways,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. The workflow is available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/ViralLink) in an easily accessible Python wrapper script, or as customisable modular R and Python scripts.Author summary Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets and speeds the process of discovery. Such ways of working are especially important at present due to the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we present a systems biology workflow which models the effect of viral proteins on the infected host cell, to aid collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily applied to different datasets as they are made available.

491,Biochemical evidence of furin specificity and potential for phospho-regulation at Spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site in SARS-CoV2 but not in SARS-CoV1 or MERS-CoV,"The Spike protein of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 contains an insertion 680SPRRAR{downarrow}SV687 forming a cleavage motif RxxR for furin-like enzymes at the boundary of S1/S2 subunits. Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR{downarrow}SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site. Although phosphoregulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.","Örd, M.; Faustova, I.; Loog, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False

In this study we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using 22 virus genome sequences reported by three different laboratories in Morocco till the date 07/06/2020 as well as (40366) virus genomes from all around the world.

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Moroccan patients revealed 62 mutations of which 30 were missense mutations. The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred one time in our sequences with no record in other sequence worldwide. These mutations should be investigated to figure out their potential effects on all around the world virulence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses pertaining to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C. This finding suggest that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. For multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country.

493,Endemic human coronaviruses induce distinct antibody repertoires in adults and children,"Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans but immune responses to these ""common cold"" viruses remain incompletely understood. Moreover, there is evidence emerging from independent studies which suggests that endemic HCoVs can induce broadly cross-reactive T cell responses and may thereby affect clinical outcomes of acute infections with the phylogenetically related epidemic viruses, namely MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here we report a comprehensive retrospective analysis of CoV-specific antibody specificities in a large number of samples from children and adults using Phage-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). We estimate the seroprevalence for endemic HCoVs to range from ~4% to ~27% depending on species and cohort. Most importantly, we identified a large number of novel linear B cell epitopes of HCoV proteins and demonstrate that antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs are qualitatively different in children in comparison to the general adult population and healthy adult blood bank donors. We show that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children target functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the HCoV spike and nucleocapsid proteins and some antibody specificities are broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronavirus isolates. Our findings shed light on the humoral immune responses to natural infection with endemic HCoVs and may have important implications for understanding of the highly variable clinical outcomes of human coronavirus infections, for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.","Khan, T.; Rahman, M.; Al Ali, F.; Huang, S.

494,Mathematical modeling explains differential SARS CoV-2 kinetics in lung and nasal passages in remdesivir treated rhesus macaques,"Remdesivir was recently demonstrated to decrease recovery time in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In rhesus macaques, early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and lowered viral loads in the lung, but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy. We developed mathematical models to explain these results. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung.

495,Female reproductive tract has low concentration of SARS-CoV2 receptors,"There has been significant concern regarding fertility and reproductive outcomes during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is unlikely to contribute to pregnancy-related adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk, oogenesis and female fertility.","Goad, J.; Rudolph, J.; Rajkovic, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
496,"Pathogenicity, tissue tropism and potential vertical transmission of SARSr-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins","SARS-CoV-2 is having severe impact on public health at a global scale. Malayan pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-2) is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. We show that CT scans of virus-positive pangolins reveal bilateral ground-glass opacities in lungs in similar manner to COVID-19 patients. The virus infected multiple organs in pangolins, with the lungs being the major target. Histological expression showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed with viral RNA. Transcriptome analysis revealed an inadequate interferon response, with different dysregulated chemokines and cytokines responses in pregnant and non-pregnant adults and fetuses. Viral RNA and protein were detected in three fetuses providing evidence for vertical virus transmission. In sum, our study identifies the biological framework of SARSr-CoV-2 in pangolins, revealing striking similarities to COVID-19 in humans.","Shen, Y.; Chen, W.; Holmes, E.

497,Functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a complex inflammatory response and metabolic alterations,"Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has reached the category of a worldwide pandemic. Even though intensive efforts, no effective treatments or a vaccine are available. Molecular characterization of the transcriptional response in Covid-19 patients could be helpful to identify therapeutic targets. In this study, RNAseq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls was analyzed from a functional point of view using probabilistic graphical models. Two networks were built: one based on genes differentially expressed between healthy and infected individuals and another one based on the 2,000 most variable genes in terms of expression in order to make a functional characterization. In the network based on differentially expressed genes, two inflammatory response nodes with different tendencies were identified, one related to cytokines and chemokines, and another one related to bacterial infections. In addition, differences in metabolism, which were studied in depth using Flux Balance Analysis, were identified. SARS-CoV2-infection caused alterations in glutamate, methionine and cysteine, and tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism. In the network based on 2,000 most variable genes, also two inflammatory nodes with different tendencies between healthy individuals and patients were identified. Similar to the other network, one was related to cytokines and chemokines. However, the other one, lower in Covid-19 patients, was related to allergic processes and self-regulation of the immune response. Also, we identified a decrease in T cell node activity and an increase in cell division node activity. In the current absence of treatments for these patients, functional characterization of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be helpful to define targetable processes. Therefore, these results may be relevant to propose new treatments.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection caused Covid-19 which has reached the category of a worldwide pandemic. However, no treatments or vaccines are still available. For this reason, it is still necessary the molecular study of this disease. In this study, we reanalyzed data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls using computational techniques that allow the study of differential biological processes and metabolic pathways. The results suggested a complex inflammatory response, involving genes related to response to bacterial infection and allergic processes, and alterations in metabolic pathways such as glutamate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism or tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism. These processes could be used in the future as therapeutic targets in Covi-19 infection.","Trilla-Fuertes, L.; Ramos-Ruiz, R.; Blanca-Lopez, N.; Lopez-Camacho, E.; Martin-Pedraza, L.; Ryan Murua, P.; Diaz-Almiron, M.; Llorens, C.; Gabaldon, T.; Moya, A.; Fresno, J.

While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4 compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7 were shortlisted for validation.

499,Companion vaccine Bioinformatic design tool reveals limited functional genomic variability of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain,"Tracking the genetic variability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for several reasons, such as to identify target sequences to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution; and to mine for viral variants associated with reduced or increased severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic analyses have been released for this purpose; four main viral clades have been described via phylogenetic analyses. Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (April-June 2020) confirms no high variability pressure on the viral genome in terms of quality and quantity of mutations. We then focused our analysis on the receptor-binding domain region of the spike protein and only found a few variants associated with particular geographic locations that should be tracked over time. Finally, additional immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility and T-cell recognition for most frequent human HLAs.","Massacci, A.; D'Ambrosio, L.; Sperandio, E.; Palombo, F.; Aurisicchio, L.; Ciliberto, G.; Pallocca, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.133355v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.133355v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
500,Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike glycoprotein putative antigenic epitopes in vitro by intracellular aminopeptidases,"Presentation of antigenic peptides by MHCI is central to cellular immune responses against viral pathogens. While adaptive immune responses versus SARS-CoV-2 can be of critical importance to both recovery and vaccine efficacy, how protein antigens from this pathogen are processed to generate antigenic peptides is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of overlapping precursor peptides spanning the entire sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, by three key enzymes that generate antigenic peptides, aminopeptidases ERAP1, ERAP2 and IRAP. All enzymes generated shorter peptides with sequences suitable for binding onto HLA alleles, but with distinct specificity fingerprints. ERAP1 was the most efficient in generating peptides 8-11 residues long, the optimal length for HLA binding, while IRAP was the least efficient. The combination of ERAP1 with ERAP2 greatly limited the variability of peptide sequences produced. Less than 7% of computationally predicted epitopes were found to be produced experimentally, suggesting that aminopeptidase processing may constitute a significant filter to epitope presentation. These experimentally generated putative epitopes could be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity studies and vaccine design. We furthermore propose that this in vitro trimming approach could constitute a general filtering method to enhance the prediction robustness for viral antigenic epitopes.","Stamatakis, G.; Samiotaki, M.; Mpakali, A.; Panayotou, G.; Stratikos, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False
501,"In vivo antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age","Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-{kappa}B signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","Lieberman, N.

There have been reports of Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) used in clinical treatment. In our study, we used CCK-8 stain, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent stain to evaluated the toxicity and autophagy of CQ and HCQ respectively on ACE2 high expressed HEK293T cells (ACE2hi cells). We further analysied the binding character of CQ and HCQ to ACE2 by molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and molecule docking, COVID-19 spike pseudotype virus was also taken to investigate the suppression viropexis effect of CQ and HCQ. Results showed that HCQ is slightly more toxic to ACE2hi cells than CQ, both CQ and HCQ could bind to ACE2, and they also exhibit equivalent suppression effect for the entrance of COVID-19 Spike pseudotype virus into ACE2hi cells.

503,Various RNA-binding proteins and their conditional networks explain miRNA biogenesis and help to reveal the potential SARS-CoV-2 host miRNAome system,"BackgroundIn-spite of ubiquitous expression of DROSA/DICER, miRNA formation and maturation are highly spatiotemporal implying involvement of other factors in their biogenesis. Several key studies have elucidated functions of few other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in miRNAs biogenesis, making it necessary to look miRNA biogenesis models with fresh approach.

ResultsA comprehensive study of >25TB of high-throughput data revealed that various combinations of RBPs and their networks determine the miRNA pool, regardless of DROSHA/DICER. The discovered RBP and miRNA associations displayed strong functional alliances. An RBP, AAR2, was found highly associated with miRNAs biogenesis, which was experimentally validated. The RBPs combinations and networks were tested successfully across a large number of experimentally validated data and cell lines for the observed associations. The RBP networks were finally modeled into a XGBoosting-regression based tool to identify miRNA profiles without any need of doing miRNA-seq, which scored a reliable average accuracy of 91% on test sets. It was further tested across >400 independent experimental samples and scored consistently high accuracy. This tool was applied to reveal the miRNAome of Covid19 patients about which almost negligible information exists. A significant number of Covid19 specific miRNA targets were involved in IFN-gamma, Insulin/IGF/P3K/AKT, and Ub-proteasome systems, found in cross-talk with each other and down-regulated heavily, holding promise as strong candidates for therapeutic solution. A large number of them belonged to zinc-finger family.

ConclusionThere are several RBPs and their networks responsible for miRNA biogenesis, regardless of DROSHA/DICER.

504,"Genomic diversity and hotspot mutations in 30,983 SARS-CoV-2 genomes: moving toward a universal vaccine for the ""confined virus""?","The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late November 2019 in Wuhan, China. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 8 million people worldwide and killed over 5% of them. Efforts are being made all over the world to control the spread of the disease and most importantly to develop a vaccine. Understanding the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographic characteristics and stability is particularly important for developing a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and for predicting its efficacy. In this perspective, we analyzed the sequences of 30,983 complete genomes from 80 countries located in six geographical zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North & South America, and Oceania) isolated from December 24, 2019 to May 13, 2020, and compared them to the reference genome. Our in-depth analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites compared to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, with a distribution that is largely uniform over all continents. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations was observed; only 182 mutations (5.67%) had a prevalence greater than 1%. Nevertheless, fourteen hotspot mutations (> 10%) were identified at different locations, seven at the ORF1ab gene (in regions coding for nsp2, nsp3, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15), three in the nucleocapsid protein, one in the spike protein, one in orf3a, and one in orf8. Moreover, 35 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human receptor ACE2.

These results along with the phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that the virus does not have a significant divergence at the protein level compared to the reference both among and within different geographical areas. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the slow rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes the potential of developing an effective global vaccine very likely.","Alouane, T.; Laamarti, M.; Essabbar, A.; Hakmi, M.; Bouricha, E.

506,A path towards SARS-CoV-2 attenuation: metabolic pressure on CTP synthesis rules the virus evolution,"Fighting the COVID-19 epidemic summons deep understanding of the way SARS-CoV-2 taps into its host cell metabolic resources. We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. We also highlight and provide a raison detre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3-deoxy-3',4-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","Ou, Z.; Ouzounis, C.; Wang, D.; Sun, W.; Li, J.; Chen, W.; Marliere, P.; Danchin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False

Infection of African green monkeys (AGM) with a low passage human isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol or mucosal exposure resulted in mild clinical infection with a transient decrease in lung tidal volume. Imaging with human clinical-grade 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) co-registered with computed tomography (CT) revealed pulmonary lesions at 4 days post-infection (dpi) that resolved over time. Infectious virus was shed from both respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts in all animals in a biphasic manner, first between 2-7 dpi followed by a recrudescence at 14-21 dpi. Viral RNA (vRNA) was found throughout both respiratory and gastrointestinal systems at necropsy with higher levels of vRNA found within the GI tract tissues. All animals seroconverted simultaneously for IgM and IgG, which has also been documented in human COVID-19 cases. Young AGM represent an excellent species to study mild/subclinical COVID-19 disease and have shed light on unknown aspects of long-term virus shedding. They are ideally suited for preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutic interventions.

508,RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase From SARS-CoV-2. Mechanism Of Reaction And Inhibition By Remdesivir.,"We combine sequence analysis, molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to obtain the first description of the mechanism of reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and of the inhibition of the enzyme by Remdesivir. Despite its evolutionary youth, the enzyme is highly optimized to have good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency. Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition. However, after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a hydrated Serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a Pinners reaction with the nitrile group of Remdesivir. Kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to Remdesivir inhibition.","Aranda, J.; Orozco, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163592v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163592v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False
509,Characterizing transcriptional regulatory sequences in coronaviruses and their role in recombination,"Novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, often originate from recombination events. The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","Yang, Y.; Yan, W.; Hall, B.; Jiang, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163410v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163410v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False

511,anti-IL-6 versus anti-IL-6R Blocking Antibodies to Treat Acute Ebola Infection in BALB/c Mice with Potential Implications for Treating Patients Presenting with COVID-19,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is known to be a factor in morbidity and mortality associated with acute viral infections including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity, important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an anti-IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of anti-IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS.

512,"SARS-CoV-2 growth, furin-cleavage-site adaptation and neutralization using serum from acutely infected, hospitalized COVID-19 patients","SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged at the end of 2019 and by mid-June 2020, the virus has spread to at least 215 countries, caused more than 8,000,000 confirmed infections and over 450,000 deaths, and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal. These studies illustrate the need to characterize virus stocks meticulously prior to performing either in vitro or in vivo pathogenesis studies.","Klimstra, W. B.; Tilston-Lunel, N.

514,Transcriptional response of signalling pathways to SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal human bronchial epithelial cells,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19 disease, emerged in Wuhan region in China in 2019, infected more than 4M people and is responsible for death of at least 300K patients globally as of May 2020. Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible.

In this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NF{kappa}B, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NF{kappa}B pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.","Ak, E.; Pir, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163006v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163006v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False
515,"Rapid Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Silicon Nitride, Copper, and Aluminum Nitride","IntroductionViral disease spread by contaminated commonly touched surfaces is a global concern. Silicon nitride, an industrial ceramic that is also used as an implant in spine surgery, has known antibacterial activity. The mechanism of antibacterial action relates to the hydrolytic release of surface disinfectants. It is hypothesized that silicon nitride can also inactivate the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to 15 wt.% aqueous suspensions of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, and copper particles. The virus was titrated by the TCD50 method using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, while viral RNA was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunostaining and Raman spectroscopy were used as additional probes to investigate the cellular responses to virions exposed to the respective materials.

ResultsAll three tested materials showed >99% viral inactivation at one and ten minutes of exposure. Degradation of viral RNA was also observed with all materials. Immunofluorescence testing showed that silicon nitride-treated virus failed to infect VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells without damaging them. In contrast, the copper-treated virus suspension severely damaged the cells due to copper ion toxicity. Raman spectroscopy indicated differential biochemical cellular changes due to infection and metal toxicity for two of the three materials tested.

ConclusionsSilicon nitride successfully inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The mechanism of action was the hydrolysis-mediated surface release of nitrogen-containing disinfectants. Both aluminum nitride and copper were also effective in the inactivation of the virus. However, while the former compound affected the cells, the latter compound had a cytopathic effect. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and investigate whether silicon nitride can be incorporated into personal protective equipment and commonly touched surfaces, as a strategy to discourage viral persistence and disease spread.","Pezzotti, G.; Ohgitani, E.; Shin-Ya, M.; Adachi, T.; Marin, E.; Boschetto, F.; Zhu, W.; Mazda, O.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.159970v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.159970v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False
516,Assessing uncertainty in the rooting of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny,"The rooting of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is important for understanding the origin and early spread of the virus. Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide consistent results. We use several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. Our results suggest that inferences on the origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on rooted trees should be interpreted with caution.","Pipes, L.; Wang, H.; Huelsenbeck, J.; Nielsen, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.160630v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.160630v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False
517,SARS-CoV-2 assays to detect functional antibody responses that block ACE2 recognition in vaccinated animals and infected patients,"SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has caused a global pandemic of COVID-19 resulting in cases of mild to severe respiratory distress and significant mortality. The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >8 million people worldwide with >2 million cases in the US (June 17th, 2020). There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise, an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-going. Here we describe a rapid serological diagnostic assay for determining antibody receptor blocking and demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring the antibody functionality of sera from small animals and non-human primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and using sera from infected patients.","Kulp, D.

518,The D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances viral infectivity and decreases neutralization sensitivity to individual convalescent sera,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spike (S) protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is a major target for vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, insights into its sequence variations are key to understanding the infection and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A dominant mutational variant at position 614 of the S protein (aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation) was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence obtained from the Nextstrain database. Using a pseudovirus-based assay, we identified that S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudotyped viruses share a common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could be blocked by recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. However, S-D614 and S-G614 protein demonstrated functional differences. First, S-G614 protein could be cleaved by serine protease elastase-2 more efficiently. Second, S-G614 pseudovirus infected 293T-ACE2 cells significantly more efficiently than did the S-D614 pseudovirus, especially in the presence of elastase-2. Third, an elastase inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus infection. Moreover, 93% (65/70) convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19 could neutralize both S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies, but about 7% (5/70) convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against the S-G614 pseudovirus.

519,"Structural variability, expression profile and pharmacogenetics properties of TMPRSS2 gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy","The human serine protease TMPRSS2 gene is involved in the priming of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins being one of the possible targets for COVID-19 therapy. TMPRSS2 gene is possibly co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes ACE2 and BSG, but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data of 76 human populations demonstrates that functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in TMPRSS2 gene, was found in many human populations in relatively high frequency, featuring region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by the rs12329760, which previously was found to be associated with prostate cancer, is ranged between 10% and 63% being significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared to European populations. In addition to SNPs, two copy numbers variants (CNV) were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. Number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) and Curcumin. Thus TMPRSS2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2, its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, and expression regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomics properties characterize this gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.","Zarubin, A.; Stepanov, V.; Markov, A.; Kolesnikov, N.; Marusin, A.; Khitrinskaya, I.; Swarovskaya, M.; Litvinov, S.; Ekomasova, N.; Dzhaubermezov, M.; Maksimova, N.; Sukhomyasova, A.; Shtygasheva, O.; Khusnutdinova, E.; Radjabov, M.; Kharkov, V.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.156224v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.156224v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False

522,The enzymatic activity of the nsp14 exoribonuclease is critical for replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.

IO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWThe bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","S.

The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types. The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in 238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L & Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence.

Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS is difficult to treat clinically, and new therapeutic strategies are needed. In order to evaluate such therapeutic strategies, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed. Here we report fatal ARDS in two African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. Moreover, we report the observation of cytokine release (cytokine storm) in three of four infected AGMs. All four animals showed increased levels of IL-6 in plasma, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs.

Simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions.

526,Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 is present in currently available intravenous immunoglobulins,"BackgroundThere is a crucial need for effective therapies that are immediately available to counteract COVID-19 disease. Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.

MethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).

ResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV.

ConclusionIn cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.","Diez, J.

527,Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 phase separates into RNA-rich polymerase-containing condensates,"The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Savastano, A.; Ibanez-de-Opakua, A.; Rankovic, M.; Zweckstetter, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.160648v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.160648v1?rss=1,2020-06-19,2020-06-19,,False
528,"Identification of a critical horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 (Mpro, 3CLpro) protease interdomain loop (IDL) of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)","Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.

ImportanceIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","Nick, B.

529,Drug repurposing screens reveal FDA approved drugs active against SARS-Cov-2,"There are an urgent need for antivirals to treat the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. To identify new candidates we screened a repurposing library of ~3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells found few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validated 23 diverse antiviral drugs. Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity. These antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.","Dittmar, M.; Lee, J.

530,A single dose of recombinant VSV-{triangleup}G-spike vaccine provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in December 2019 in China resulted in over 7.8 million infections and over 430,000 deaths worldwide, imposing an urgent need for rapid development of an efficient and cost-effective vaccine, suitable for mass immunization. Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load. Taken together, we suggest recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yahalom-Ronen, Y.; Tamir, H.; Melamed, S.; Politi, B.; Shifman, O.; Achdout, H.; B.

531,Evaluation of the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tools and their positioning in COVID-19 diagnostic strategies.,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful outbreak containment. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Additional diagnostic methods enabling the detection of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection would be highly beneficial to ensure the timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Here, we investigated several serological tools, i.e., two immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFA-1 (Biosynex COVID-19 BSS) and LFA-2 (COVID-19 Sign IgM/IgG)) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting IgA (ELISA-1 Euroimmun), IgM (ELISA-2 EDI) and/or IgG (ELISA-1 and ELISA-2) based on well-characterized panels of serum samples from patients and healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. A total of 272 serum samples were used, including 62 serum samples from hospitalized patients (panel 1 and panel 3), 143 serum samples from healthcare workers (panel 2) diagnosed with COVID-19 and 67 serum samples from negative controls. Diagnostic performances of each assay were assessed according to days after symptom onset (dso) and the antigenic format used by manufacturers. We found overall sensitivities ranging from 69% to 93% on panels 1 and 2 and specificities ranging from 83% to 98%. The clinical sensitivity varied greatly according to the panel tested and the dso.

532,Mechanism and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro,"Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode multifunctional proteases that are essential for viral replication and evasion of host innate immune mechanisms. The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.","Klemm, T.; Ebert, G.; Calleja, D.

To address this, we used a rapidly growing genomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with relevant metadata information. SARS-CoV-2 genomes show a progressive increase of C-to-U substitutions resulting in CpG loss over just a few months. This is consistent with APOBEC-mediated RNA editing resulting in CpG reduction, thus allowing the virus to escape ZAP-mediated RNA degradation.

535,Dog Savior: Immediate Scent-Detection of SARS-COV-2 by Trained Dogs,"Molecular tests for viral diagnostics are essential to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, but their production and distribution cannot satisfy the current high demand. Early identification of infected people and their contacts is the key to being able to isolate them and prevent the dissemination of the pathogen; unfortunately, most countries are unable to do this due to the lack of diagnostic tools. Dogs can identify, with a high rate of precision, unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during an infection; as a result, dogs can diagnose infectious agents by smelling specimens and, sometimes, the body of an infected individual. We trained six dogs of three different breeds to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions of infected patients and evaluated their performance experimentally, comparing it against the gold standard (rRT-PCR). Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals. The highest metric was the negative predictive value, indicating that with a disease prevalence of 7.6%, 99.9% of the specimens indicated as negative by the dogs did not carry the virus. These findings demonstrate that dogs could be useful to track viral infection in humans, allowing COVID-19 free people to return to work safely.","Vesga, O.; Valencia, A.

Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection. Our results suggest that functional B and/or T cells are not only important for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, but also play an early role in protection from acute disease.

537,Antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters reveals a weak effect of favipiravir and a complete lack of effect for hydroxychloroquine,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to infect millions of people. To date, close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The high need for treatment options, together with the lack of small animal models of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo evidence attesting their efficacy was available. We used Syrian hamsters to establish a model to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting. Upon intranasal infection, the animals developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and pathology similar to that observed in mild COVID-19 patients. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus. Micro-CT scan analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals, which was confirmed by histopathology. In addition, both compounds did not prevent virus transmission through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments. By modelling the PK profile of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations, we show that the total lung exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor. In conclusion, we here characterized a hamster infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds. The information acquired using hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in this model is of critical value to those designing (current and) future clinical trials. At this point, the data here presented on hydroxychloroquine either alone or combined with azithromycin (together with previously reported in vivo data in macaques and ferrets) provide no scientific basis for further use of the drug in humans.","Kaptein, S.

539,No evidence of coronaviruses or other potentially zoonotic viruses in Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) entering the wildlife trade via Malaysia.,"The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our  upstream market chain samples suggests that these detections in  downstream animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.

The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server.

As per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-13.9 kcal/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (-12.5 kcal/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4.

Four of these mimicked 8-mers/9-mers map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This striking mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made more salient by the targeted genes being focally expressed in arteries, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, and macrophages. Further, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases with primary expression of the mimicked human proteins in the neurons and immune cells. These findings highlight molecular mimicry as a shared strategy adopted by evolutionary titans -- the virus in its quest for escaping herd immune surveillance, and the host immune systems that are constantly learning the patterns of ""self"" and ""non-self"".","Venkatakrishnan, A.; Kayal, N.; Anand, P.; Badley, A.

542,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock and wildlife.","Conceicao, C.; Thakur, N.; Human, S.; Kelly, J.

543,Unexpected free fatty acid binding pocket in the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a global crisis. Key to SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development is unraveling the mechanisms driving high infectivity, broad tissue tropism and severe pathology. Our cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein reveals that the receptor binding domains (RBDs) tightly and specifically bind the essential free fatty acid (FFA) linoleic acid (LA) in three composite binding pockets. The pocket also appears to be present in the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Lipid metabolome remodeling is a key feature of coronavirus infection, with LA at its core. LA metabolic pathways are central to inflammation, immune modulation and membrane fluidity. Our structure directly links LA and S, setting the stage for interventions targeting LA binding and metabolic remodeling by SARS-CoV-2.

544,"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA","The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant RNA binding protein that plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle including replication, transcription, and genome packaging. Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.","Cubuk, J.; Alston, J. J.; Incicco, J.

The outbreak had a negative impact on all health care systems throughout the world and overwhelmed the diagnostic laboratories as well. During the pandemic, handling patient specimens in accordance with the universal guidelines was troublesome as WHO, CDC and ECDC required cold chain compliance during transporting and storing the swap samples.

Materials and methodsIn this study, we tested diagnostic performance of RT-PCR on 30 swab samples stored at ambient temperature and compared them with the samples stored at +4{degrees}C.

ResultsOur results revealed that all the samples stored at ambient temperature remain PCR positive for at least five days. We did not see any false negativity.

546,Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 reveals community transmission of a major lineage during the early pandemic phase in Brazil,"Despite all efforts to control the COVID-19 spread, the SARS-CoV-2 reached South America within three months after its first detection in China, and Brazil became one of the hotspots of COVID-19 in the world. Several SARS-CoV-2 lineages have been identified and some local clusters have been described in this early pandemic phase in Western countries. Here we investigated the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase (late February to late April) of the epidemic in Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and the community transmission of a major B.1.1 lineage defined by two amino acid substitutions in the Nucleocapsid and ORF6. This SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineage was probably established during February 2020 and rapidly spread through the country, reaching different Brazilian regions by the middle of March 2020. Our study also supports occasional exportations of this Brazilian B.1.1 lineage to neighboring South American countries and to more distant countries before the implementation of international air travels restrictions in Brazil.","Resende, P.

547,Saliva-Based Molecular Testing for SARS-CoV-2 that Bypasses RNA Extraction,"Convenient, repeatable, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 would be a key weapon to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 1 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging RBD and NTD revealed recognition of the closed, ""all RBD-down"" conformation of the spike.

In related SARS-CoV-1, 3a is implicated in viral release, inflammasome activation, and cell death and its deletion reduces viral titer and morbidity in animal models, suggesting 3a-targeted therapeutics could treat SARS and COVID-19. However, the structural basis for the function of 3a is unknown. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 3a forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in all Alpha- and Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.","Kern, D.

FindingsOf the total 50 samples, 4 samples did not contain any variants. Variant calling identified 379 variants. Earliest strains are found in Iranian samples. Variant alignment indicates Iran samples have a low variant frequency. Saudi Arabia has formed an outgroup.

552,Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib as a potential drug for COVID-19,"The rapid geographic expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, poses an immediate need for potent drugs that can help contain the outbreak. Enveloped viruses infect the host cell by cellular membrane fusion, a crucial mechanism required for virus replication. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptor, is considered as a potential target for drug development. Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide initial evidence that inhibition of virus fusion may explain the antiviral action of imatinib. This finding is significant since pinpointing the mode of action allows evaluating the drugs affinity to the SARS-CoV-2-specific target protein, and in turn, helps make inferences on the potency of the drug and evidence-based recommendations on its dosage. To this end, we provide evidence that imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+/-} 0.9 {micro}M, levels. We also show that imatinib inhibits other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, possibly via fusion inhibition. Based on promising in vitro results, we propose the Abl kinase inhibitor (ATKI), imatinib, to be a viable repurposable drug candidate for further clinical validation against COVID-19.","Mulgaonkar, N.

Conservation of these antigens among viral strains is critical to ensure optimum diagnostic test performance and broad protective efficacy, respectively. We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency. In conclusion, the N and S antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are well conserved antigens, but new clades are emerging and may need to be included in future diagnostic and vaccine formulations.","Dumonteil, E.; Herrera, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.158329v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.158329v1?rss=1,2020-06-18,2020-06-18,,False
554,Early temporal dynamics of cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have evolved proteins that can inhibit host antiviral responses, likely contributing to disease progression and high case-fatality rates. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 resulting in a global pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to induce a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells, leading to speculation about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit innate antiviral responses. However, innate antiviral responses are dynamic in nature and gene expression levels rapidly change within minutes to hours. In this study, we have performed a time series RNA-seq and selective immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung (Calu-3) cells to characterize early virus-host processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated transcripts for type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after 12 hours. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit type I IFN production and downstream antiviral signaling in human cells. Using exogenous stimuli, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to modulate IFN{beta} production and downstream expression of ISGs, such as IRF7 and IFIT1. Thus, data from our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved additional mechanisms, such as masking of viral nucleic acid sensing by host cells to mount a dampened innate antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully identify the range of immune-modulatory strategies of SARS-CoV-2.

SignificanceHighly pathogenic coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS have evolved proteins to shutdown antiviral responses. The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with its relatively low case-fatality rate have led to speculation about its ability to modulate antiviral responses. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to block antiviral responses that are mounted by exogenous stimuli. Data from our study provide promising support for the use of recombinant type I IFN as combination therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our data also suggest that the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently modulate antiviral responses may be associated with its low case-fatality rate compared to other pathogenic CoVs that cause SARS and MERS.","Banerjee, A.; Budylowski, P.; Richard, D.; Maan, H.; Aguiar, J.; El-Sayes, N.; D'Agostino, M.

Here we experimentally measure how all amino-acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBDs surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses.

558,in-silica Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral strain using Reverse Vaccinology Approach: A Case Study for USA,"The recent pandemic of COVID19 that has struck the world is yet to be battled by a potential cure. Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.

The Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].

Since then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a ""global health emergency"". [14].

Current Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.

Though, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies have indicated that -

""SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19"".

Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen with SARS-CoV-2 and identified known SARS-CoV-2 host factors including the receptor ACE2 and protease Cathepsin L. We additionally discovered novel pro-viral genes and pathways including the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and key components of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of these pathways prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death. We also revealed that the alarmin HMGB1 is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication. In contrast, loss of the histone H3.3 chaperone complex sensitized cells to virus-induced death.

We next developed a sequence alignment free method that extensively searches for advantageous mutations and rank them in an increase level for their intrapopulation frequency. Time-series analysis of occurrences of oligonucleotides of diverse lengths for SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed seven distinctive mutations that rapidly expanded their intrapopulation frequency and are thought to be candidates of advantageous mutations for the efficient growth in human cells.","Wada, K.; Wada, Y.; Ikemura, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282v1?rss=1,2020-06-17,2020-06-17,,False
561,Mutation density changes in SARS-CoV-2 are related to the pandemic stage but to a lesser extent in the dominant strain with mutations in spike and RdRp,"Since its emergence in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 have been among the most debated issues related to COVID-19. Throughout its spread around the world, the viral genome continued acquiring new mutations and some of them became widespread. Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the ""mutant"" (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype. The nature of these unexpected relationships warrant further research.","Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Karakulah, G.; Oktay, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153239v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153239v1?rss=1,2020-06-17,2020-06-17,,False

To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems-wide manner. This identified connections between the corresponding cellular events, revealed functional effects of the individual viral proteins and put these findings into the context of host signaling pathways. We investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs.

565,Pervasive RNA secondary structure in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - an endeavour to understand its biological purpose,"The ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and is dependent on a complex interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility and population immunity. In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","Simmonds, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?rss=1,2020-06-17,2020-06-17,,False

Here we report the crystal structure of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 bound to a previously identified Chinese herb inhibitor shikonin at 2.45 angstrom resolution. Although the structure revealed here shares similar overall structure with other published structures, there are several key differences which highlight potential features that could be exploited. The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 undergoes dramatic conformational changes, and the structure reveals an unusual arrangement of oxyanion loop stabilized by the substrate. Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding. As we learn more about different binding modes and their structure-function relationships, it is probable that we can design more effective and specific drugs with high potency that can serve as effect SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents.","Li, J.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, F.; Lin, C.; McCormick, P.

Two-plex correlation analysis revealed higher binding of serum IgM to RBD than to S1. IgG antibody avidity toward multiple antigens were measured, shedding light on antibody maturation in COVID-19 patients and affording a powerful tool for differentiating recent from remote infections and identifying re-infection by SARS-CoV-2.

With no vaccines, and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus outbreaks4. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes is unknown5. Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV. Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sanders, W.; Fritch, E.

Although clinically approved drugs have been repurposed to treat individuals with 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the lack of safety studies and limited efficiency as well jeopardize clinical benefits. Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. In the HCV replicative cycle, daclatasvir and SFV target the viral enzymes NS5A and NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. These characteristics of the HCV and SARS-CoV-2 motivated us to further study the activity of daclatasvir and SFV against the new coronavirus. Daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Daclatasvir targeted early events during SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and prevented the induction of IL-6 and TNF-, inflammatory mediators associated with the cytokine storm typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sofosbuvir, although inactive in Vero cells, displayed EC50 values of 6.2 and 9.5 M in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, respectively.

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families.

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients.

MethodologyWe performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)/lung/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients; and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

ResultsWe observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and aging blood transcriptome.

ConclusionsPathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and co-morbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.","Bhattacharyya, U.; Thelma, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.151761v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.151761v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False
576,"COVID-19-related coagulopathy, is transferrin a missing link?","SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term ""blood coagulation"" did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.","McLaughlin, K.-M.; Bechtel, M.; Bojkova, D.; Ciesek, S.; Wass, M.

577,Massive transient damage of the olfactory epithelium associated with infection of sustentacular cells by SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters,"Anosmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","Bryche, B.; Saint-Albin Deliot, A.; Murri, S.; Lacote, S.; Pulido, C.; Ar Gouilh, M.; Lesellier, S.; Servat, A.; Wasniewski, M.; Picard-Meyer, E.; Montchartre-Leroy, E.; Volmer, R.; Rampin, O.; Le Goffic, R.; Marianneau, P.; Meunier, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151704v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False
578,Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 conferred by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of different species,"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a huge threat to many countries around the world. However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts.

IMPORTANCEIn this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tang, Y.-D.; Li, Y.; Sun, J.; Zhang, H.; Wang, T.-y.; Sun, M.-X.; Yang, Y.-L.; Hu, X.; Zhao, J.; Cai, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153916v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153916v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False
579,Predicting mammalian hosts in which novel coronaviruses can be generated.,"Novel pathogenic coronaviruses - including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 - arise by homologous recombination in a host cell1,2. This process requires a single host to be infected with more than one type of coronavirus, which recombine to form novel strains of virus with unique combinations of genetic material. Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses requires identifying hosts (termed recombination hosts) of more than one coronavirus type, in which recombination might occur. However, the majority of coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown, and therefore the vast majority of recombination hosts for coronaviruses cannot be identified. Here we show that there are 11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, and over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2 recombination hosts, than have been observed to date. We show there are over 40-fold more host species with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses. This underestimation of both number and novel coronavirus generation in wild and domesticated animals. Our results list specific high-risk hosts in which our model predicts homologous recombination could occur, our model identifies both wild and domesticated mammals including known important and understudied species. We recommend these species for coronavirus surveillance, as well as enforced separation in livestock markets and agriculture.","Wardeh, M.; Baylis, M.; Blagrove, M.

Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies for addressing this need and numerous compounds have been selected for in vitro testing by several groups already. These have led to a growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus. Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein we have implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to prioritize additional FDA approved compounds for in vitro testing selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, CPI1062 and CPI1155 showed antiviral activity in HeLa-ACE2 cell-based assays and represent potential repurposing opportunities for COVID-19.

582,Genomic modeling as an approach to identify surrogates for use in experimental validation of SARS-CoV-2 and HuNoVs inactivation by UV-C treatment,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to pose significant public health concerns. While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human noroviruses surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r2=0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D90 - dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21 and 28 J/m2, respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m2 as published for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D90 of 21 J/m2 close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D90 values of 69.1, 89 and 77.6 J/m2 for genogroups GI, GII and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D90 = 100 J/m2 was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential nonpathogenic surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","Pendyala, B.; Patras, A.; DSouza, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151290v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151290v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False
583,"TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 internalization protease is downregulated in head and neck cancer patients.","ObjectivesTwo of the main target tissues of SARS-coronavirus 2 are the oral cavity pharynx-larynx epithelium, the main virus entry site, and the lung epithelium. The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion.

Materials and MethodsThe study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and 147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and 126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumornormal matched samples for mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21 female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center (http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). mRNA expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform. DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer (http://maplab.imppc.org/wanderer/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab R2019.

ResultsTMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient.

ConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","Sacconi, A.; Donzelli, S.; Pulito, C.; Ferrero, S.; Morrone, A.; Rigoni, M.; Pimipinelli, F.; Ensoli, F.; Sanguineti, G.; Pellini, R.; Agrawal, N.; Izumchenko, E.; Ciliberto, G.; Gianni, A.; Muti, P.; Strano, S.; Blandino, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154211v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154211v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False

We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.","Batty, E.

Here we re-analyze 72-hour time-series microarrays generated in 2013 by Sims and collaborators for SARS-CoV-1 in vitro infection of a human lung epithelial cell line. Using a Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection. The methods can be applied to RNA data sets for SARS-CoV-2 to investigate the origin of differential responses in different tissue types, or due to immune or preexisting conditions or to compare cell culture, organoid culture, animal models and human-derived samples.","de Almeida, R.

The relative contribution of viral transmission via fomites is still unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH [&ge;] 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fedorenko, A.; Grinberg, M.; Orevi, T.; Kashtan, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152983v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152983v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False

Meanwhile, the mutations on Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of B-cell immunity.

591,"AGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EXPRESSION OF PATTERN RECOGNITION RECEPTOR GENES AND ACE2, THE RECEPTOR FOR SARS-COV-2: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF COVID-19 DISEASE","Older aged adults and those with pre-existing conditions are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 associated outcomes. Using a large dataset of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts (GSE113957) we investigated whether age affects the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Older age was associated with increased expression of PRR genes, ACE2 and four genes that encode proteins that have been shown to interact with SAR2-CoV-2 proteins. Assessment of PRR expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe COVID-19 disease at both the individual and population levels.","Bickler, S. W.; Cauvi, D. M.; Fisch, K.

592,Genome-wide mapping of therapeutically-relevant SARS-CoV-2 RNA structures,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of [~]30 kb, whose outbreak caused the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve, adapt, and cross species barriers makes the development of effective and durable therapeutic strategies a challenging and urgent need. As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been identified to date.

Here, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5' UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3' UTR), and reveal new structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative druggable pockets. Furthermore, [~]8% of the identified structure elements show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. In addition, we identify a set of persistently single-stranded regions having high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.

Collectively, our work lays the foundation for the development of innovative RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.","Manfredonia, I.; Nithin, C.; Ponce-Salvatierra, A.; Ghosh, P.; Wirecki, T.

593,The SARSCoV2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in vitro models of the human blood-brain barrier,"As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding SARS-CoV-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature. Observed effects on the central nervous system includes neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is expressed throughout various caliber vessels in the frontal cortex. Additionally, ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial (hBMVEC) maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis for cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48hr exposure window. However, when the viral spike proteins were introduced into model systems that recapitulate the essential features of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), breach to the barrier was evident in various degrees depending on the spike protein subunit tested. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluid model of the human BBB, a platform that most closely resembles the human physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Subsequent analysis also showed the ability for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","Buzhdygan, T.

594,"Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein: Biophysical, Biochemical, Structural, and Antigenic Analysis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and there is a critical need to produce large quantities of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein for use in both clinical and basic science settings. To address this need, we have evaluated the expression and purification of two previously reported S protein constructs in Expi293F and ExpiCHO-S cells, two different cell lines selected for increased expression of secreted glycoproteins. We show that ExpiCHO-S cells produce enhanced yields of both SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Biochemical, biophysical, and structural (cryo-EM) characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in both cell lines demonstrate that the reported purification strategy yields high quality S protein (non-aggregated, uniform material with appropriate biochemical and biophysical properties). Importantly, we show that multiple preparations of these two recombinant S proteins from either cell line exhibit identical behavior in two different serology assays. We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human secretome. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs, and in a flexible protein microarray format. Collectively, we establish an array of metrics for ensuring the production of high-quality S protein to support clinical, biological, biochemical, structural and mechanistic studies to combat the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Herrera, N.

595,Microscopy-based assay for semi-quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human sera,"Emergence of the novel pathogenic coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 and its rapid pandemic spread presents numerous questions and challenges that demand immediate attention. Among these is the urgent need for a better understanding of humoral immune response against the virus and assessment of seroprevalence levels in the population, both of which form the basis for developing public health strategies to control viral spread. For this, sensitive, specific and quantitative serological assays are required. Here we describe the development of a semi-quantitative high-content microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes (IgG, IgA and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The possibility to detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome together with a robust semi-automated image analysis workflow resulted in improvement of sensitivity and specificity compared to an approved ELISA-based diagnostic test. Combining both methods resulted in maximum specificity in a negative control cohort, while maintaining high sensitivity. The procedure described here is compatible with high-throughput microscopy approaches and may be applied for serological analysis of other virus infections.","Pape, C.; Remme, R.; Wolny, A.; Olberg, S.; Wolf, S.; Cerrone, L.; Cortese, M.; Klaus, S.; Lucic, B.; Ullrich, S.; Anders-Össwein, M.; Wolf, S.; Berati, C.; Neufeld, C.; Ganter, M.; Schnitzler, P.; Merle, U.; Lusic, M.; Boulant, S.; Stanifer, M.; Bartenschlager, R.; Hamprecht, F.

596,Interfacial Water Molecules Make RBD of SPIKE Protein and Human ACE2 to Stick Together,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) that initially originates from Wuhan province in China has emerged as a global pandemic, an outbreak that started at the end of 2019 which claims 431,192 (Date: 15th June 2020 (https://covid19.who.in) life till now. Since then scientists all over the world are engaged in developing new vaccines, antibodies, or drug molecules to combat this new threat. Here in this work, we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions between the receptor-binding (RBD) domain of viral SPIKE protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations, computational alanine, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding affinity calculations show SARS-CoV-2 binds little more firmly to the hACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV. Analysis of simulation trajectories reveals that enhanced hydrophobic contacts or the van der Waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface. The major finding obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the RBD-ACE2 interface is populated with water molecules and interacts strongly with both RBD and ACE2 interfacial residues during the simulation periods. We also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in binding and maintaining the stability of the RBD/hACE2 complex. The water-mediated hydrogen bond by the bridge water molecules is crucial for stabilizing the RBD and ACE2 domains. The structural and dynamical features presented here may serve as a guide for developing new drug molecules, vaccines, or antibodies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malik, A.; Prahlad, D.; Kulkarni, N.; Kayal, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152892v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152892v1?rss=1,2020-06-15,2020-06-15,,False
597,The D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike increases transduction of multiple human cell types,"A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Daniloski, Z.; Guo, X.; Sanjana, N.

598,Pulmonary toxicity and inflammatory response of e-cigarettes containing medium-chain triglyceride oil and vitamin E acetate: Implications in the pathogenesis of EVALI but independent of SARS-COV-2 COVID-19 related proteins,"Recently, there has been an outbreak associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping products, associated lung injury (EVALI). The primary components of vaping products, vitamin E acetate (VEA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may be responsible for acute lung toxicity. Currently, little information is available on the physiological and biological effects of exposure to these products. We hypothesized that these e-cig cartridges and their constituents (VEA and MCT) induce pulmonary toxicity, mediated by oxidative damage and inflammatory responses, leading to acute lung injury. We studied the potential mechanisms of cartridge aerosol induced inflammatory response by evaluating the generation of reactive oxygen species by MCT, VEA, and cartridges, and their effects on the inflammatory state of pulmonary epithelium and immune cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cells exposed to these aerosols generated reactive oxygen species, caused cytotoxicity, induced epithelial barrier dysfunction, and elicited an inflammatory response. Using a murine model, the parameters of acute toxicity to aerosol inhalation were assessed. Infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes was accompanied by significant increases in IL-6, eotaxin, and G-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In mouse plasma, eicosanoid inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes, were significantly increased. Plasma from e-cig users also showed increased levels of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) and various eicosanoids. Exposure to e-cig cartridge aerosols showed the most significant effects and toxicity compared to MCT and VEA. In addition, we determined at SARS-COV-2 related proteins and found no impact associated with aerosol exposures from these tested cartridges. Overall, this study demonstrates acute exposure to specific e-cig cartridges induces in vitro cytotoxicity, barrier dysfunction, and inflammation and in vivo mouse exposure induces acute inflammation with elevated pro-inflammatory markers in the pathogenesis of EVALI.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Muthumalage, T.; Lucas, J.; Wang, Q.; Lamb, T.; McGraw, M.; Rahman, I.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151381v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.14.151381v1?rss=1,2020-06-15,2020-06-15,,False
599,Naturally mutated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants show differential levels of cell entry,"The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural observations. Nevertheless, the D614G mutant remains susceptible to neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, these data indicate that the D614G mutation enhances viral infectivity while maintaining neutralization susceptibility.","Ozono, S.; Zhang, Y.; Ode, H.; Seng, T.
