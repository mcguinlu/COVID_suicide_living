0,"Critical Mobility, a practical criterion and early indicator for regional COVID-19 resurgence","The sharp reduction of human mobility in March 2020, as observed by anonymized cellphone data, has played an important role in thwarting a runaway COVID-19 pandemic. As the world is reopening, the risks of new flare-ups are rising. We report a data-driven approach, grounded in strong correlation between mobility and growth in COVID-19 cases two weeks later, to establish a spatial-temporal model of ""critical mobility"" maps that separate relatively safe mobility levels from dangerous ones. The normalized difference between the current and critical mobility has predictive power for case trajectories during the ""opening-up"" phases. For instance, actual mobility has risen above critical mobility in many southern US counties by the end of May, foreshadowing the latest virus resurgence. Encouragingly, critical mobility has been rising throughout the USA, likely due to face mask-wearing and social distancing measures. However, critical mobility is still well below pre-COVID mobility levels in most of the country suggesting continued mobility-reduction is still necessary.","Freitag, M.

1,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by pulse-controlled amplification (PCA),"In the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, rapid identification of infected individuals is crucial for management and control of the outbreak. However, transport of samples, sample processing and RT-qPCR analysis in laboratories are time-consuming. Here we present a nucleic acid-based test Format - pulse controlled amplification - that allows detection of SARS-CoV-2 directly from up to eight swab samples simultaneously without the need for RNA extraction within 20 min in a point-of-care setting.","Zwirglmaier, K.; Weyh, M.; Krueger, C.; Ehmann, R.; Mueller, K.; Woelfel, R.; Stoecker, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20154104v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20154104v1?rss=1,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,,True
2,METFORMIN USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MORTALITY IN A DIVERSE POPULATION WITH COVID-19 AND DIABETES,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic with an increasing death toll that has been linked to various comorbidities as well as racial disparity. However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","Crouse, A.; Grimes, T.; Li, P.; Might, M.; Ovalle, F.; Shalev, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164020v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164020v1?rss=1,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,,True
3,Buzz about RT-qPCR: An RT-qPCR formulation for SARS-CoV-2 detection using reagents produced at Georgia Institute of Technology,"Widespread testing for the presence novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in patients remains vital for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the advent of an effective treatment. The early testing shortfall in some parts of the US can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can produce the RT-qPCR assay and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. We compare the performance of our in-house kit to a commercial product used for diagnostic testing and describe implementation of environmental testing to monitor surfaces across various campus laboratories for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.","Mascuch, S.

4,Disparities in Case Frequency and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Various States in the United States,"Objective: To utilize publicly reported, state-level data to identify factors associated with the frequency of cases, tests, and mortality in the US. Materials & Methods: Retrospective study using publicly reported data collected included the number of COVID-19 cases, tests, and mortality from March 14th through April 30th, 2020. Publicly available state-level data was collected which included: demographics comorbidities, state characteristics and environmental factors. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the significantly associated factors with percent mortality, case and testing frequency. All analyses were state-level analyses and not patient-level analyses. Results: A total of 1,090,500 COVID-19 cases were reported during the study period. The calculated case and testing frequency were 3,332 and 19,193 per 1,000,000 patients. There were 63,642 deaths during this period which resulted in a mortality of 5.8%. Factors including to but not limited to population density (beta coefficient 7.5, p< 0.01), transportation volume (beta coefficient 0.1, p< 0.01), tourism index (beta coefficient -0.1, p=0.02) and older age (beta coefficient 0.2, p=0.01) are associated with case frequency and percent mortality. Conclusions: There were wide variations in testing and case frequencies of COVID-19 among different states in the US. States with higher population density had a higher case and testing rate. States with larger population of elderly and higher tourism had a higher mortality.","Loomba, R. S.; Aggarwal, G.; Aggarwal, S.; Flores, S.; Villarreal, E. G.; Farias, J. S.; Lavie, C.

5,The potential health and economic impact of dexamethasone treatment for patients with COVID-19,"Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Here, we estimate the potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment would be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as its cost-effectiveness of implementing this intervention. We estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 [4,250 - 27,000] lives could be saved by January 2021. Assuming that dexamethasone has a similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, this would translate into approximately 650,000 [240,000 - 1,400,000] lives saved globally. If dexamethasone acts differently in these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen and/or ventilators, e.g. in low and middle-income countries.","AGUAS, R.; Mahdi, A.; SHRETTA, R.; Horby, P.; Landray, M.; White, L.

6,Tocilizumab shortens time on mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay in patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.,"Background: Hyperinflammation is a key feature of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a central role of the interleukin-6 pathway. We aimed to study the impact of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab on the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19. Methods: Eighty-seven patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and moderate to severe ARDS were included (n tocilizumab = 29, n controls = 58). A matched cohort was created using a propensity score. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality, secondary endpoints included ventilation-free days and length of stay. Results: No difference was found in 30-day all-cause mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab compared to controls (17.2% vs. 32.8%, p = 0.2; HR = 0.52 [0.19 - 1.39], p = 0.19). Ventilator-free days were 19.0 (IQR 12.5 - 20.0) versus 9 (IQR 0.0 - 18.5; p = 0.04), respectively. A higher rate of freedom from mechanical ventilation at 30 days was achieved in patients receiving tocilizumab (HR 2.83 [1.48 - 5.40], p < 0.002). Median length of stay in ICU and total length of stay were reduced by 8 and 9.5 days in patients treated with tocilizumab. Similar results were obtained in the analysis of the propensity score matched cohort. Conclusions: Treatment of critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 with tocilizumab was not associated with reduced 30-day all-cause mortality, but shorter duration on ventilatory support as well as shorter overall length of stay in hospital and in ICU.","Eimer, J.; Vesterbacka, J.; Svensson, A.-K.; Stojanovic, B.; Wagrell, C.; Sonnerborg, A.; Nowak, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164160v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164160v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True

8,Brazilian dental students and COVID-19: a survey on knowledge and perceptions,"This study evaluated the knowledge and perception of Brazilian dental students about COVID-19 and the undergraduate clinical practice during the outbreak by a self-administered web-based questionnaire. A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the reach population. The survey covered demographic and academic profile, general knowledge, preventive measures, and perception about the COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to identify frequencies and distributions of variables, which were compared by type of institution and current year of enrollment using Chi-square or Fishers exact tests (alpha=0.05). A total of 833 valid responses were received over 10 days. Students were able to identify the incubation period, main symptoms, and contagious routes of the disease but struggled in recognizing the name of the virus responsible for the pandemics. Hand washing before and after a dental appointment with a patient (97.7%) followed by use of barriers to protect mucosa (97.2%) were the more frequently recognized measures to prevent COVID-19 spread in the dental office. As for the perception of COVID-19, 73.2% of the dental students perceive the disease as severe, while only 11.1% of them think that COVID-19 is severe only for people presenting risk factors. Dental students knowledge and perception were associated with the type of institution and year of enrollment. In summary, the dental students demonstrated an acceptable general knowledge about COVID-19, but dental schools will need to address gaps in knowledge and control measures and perceptions to ensure a safer return to practical activities.","Aragao, M.

9,Evaluation of a novel community-based COVID-19 	'Test-to-Care model' for low-income populations,"Background: After a COVID-19 diagnosis, vulnerable populations face considerable logistical and financial challenges to isolate and quarantine. We developed and evaluated a novel, community-based approach (Test-to-Care Model) designed to address these barriers for socioeconomically vulnerable Latinx individuals with newly diagnosed COVID-19 and their households. Methods: This three-week demonstration project was nested within an epidemiologic surveillance study in a primarily Latinx neighborhood in the Mission district of San Francisco, California. The Test-to-Care model was developed with input from community members and public health leaders. Key components included: (1) provision of COVID-19-related education and information about available community resources, (2) home deliveries of material goods to facilitate safe isolation and quarantine (groceries, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies), and (3) longitudinal clinical and social support. Newly SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants were eligible to participate. Components of the model were delivered by the Test-to-Care team which was comprised of healthcare providers and community health workers (CHWs) who provided longitudinal clinic- and community-based support for the duration of the isolation period to augment existing services from the Department of Public Health (DPH). We evaluated the Test-to-Care Model using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework and drew upon multiple data sources including: programmatic data, informal interviews with participants and providers/CHWs and structured surveys among providers/CHWs. Results: Overall, 83 participants in the surveillance study were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 95% (79/83) were Latinx and 88% (65/74) had an annual household income <$50,000. Ninety-six percent (80/83) of participants were reached for results disclosure, needs assessment and DPH linkage for contact tracing. Among those who underwent an initial needs assessment, 45% (36/80) were uninsured and 55% (44/80) were not connected to primary care. Sixty-seven percent (56/83) of participants requested community-based CHW support to safely isolate at their current address and 65% (54/83) of all COVID-19 participants received ongoing community support via CHWs for the entire self-isolation period. Participants reported that the intervention was highly acceptable and that their trust increased over time - this resulted in 9 individuals who disclosed a larger number of household members than first reported, and 6 persons who requested temporary relocation to a hotel room for isolation despite initially declining this service; no unintended harms were identified. The Test-to-Care Model was found to be both acceptable and feasible to providers and CHWs. Challenges identified included a low proportion of participants linked to primary care despite support (approximately 10% after one month), and insufficient access to financial support for wage replacement. Conclusions: The Test-to-Care Model is a feasible and acceptable intervention for supporting self-isolation and quarantine among newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and their households by directly addressing key barriers faced by vulnerable populations.","Kerkhoff, A.

10,Model stability of COVID-19 mortality prediction with biomarkers,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented and fast evolving pandemic, which has caused a large number of critically ill patients and deaths globally. It is an acute public health crisis leading to overloaded critical care capacity. Timely prediction of the clinical outcome (death/survival) of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients can provide early warnings to clinicians, allowing improved allocation of medical resources. In a recently published paper, an interpretable machine learning model was presented to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients with blood biomarkers, where the model was trained and tested on relatively small data sets. However, the model or performance stability was not explored and assessed. By re-analyzing the data, we reveal that the reported mortality prediction performance was likely over-optimistic and its uncertainty was underestimated or overlooked, with a large variability in predicting deaths.","Huang, C.; Long, X.; Zhan, Z.; van den Heuvel, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20161323v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20161323v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
11,A Non-Adaptive Combinatorial Group Testing Strategy to Facilitate Healthcare Worker Screening During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak,"Background: Regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been proposed to prevent healthcare facilities becoming persistent reservoirs of infectivity. Using monoplex testing, widespread screening would be prohibitively expensive, and throughput may not meet demand. We propose a non-adaptive combinatorial (NAC) group-testing strategy to increase throughput and facilitate rapid turnaround via a single round of testing. Methods: NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350 and 250 with replicates of 2, 4 and 5, respectively. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1-10%, with each simulation ran for 10,000 iterations. Outcomes included the proportions of re-tests required and the proportion of true negatives identified. NAC matrices were compared to Dorfman Sequential (DS) approaches. A web application (www.samplepooling.com) was designed to decode results. Findings: NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels with an average number of 585 tests saved per assay in the n=700 matrix at a 1% prevalence. As prevalence increased, matrix performance deteriorated with n=250 most tolerant. In simulations of low to medium (0.1%-3%) prevalence levels all NAC matrices were superior, as measured by fewer repeated tests required, to the DS approaches. At very high prevalence levels (10%) the DS matrix was marginally superior, however both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. Interpretation: This testing strategy maximises the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to staff members. Using the methodology described here, laboratories can adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","McDermott, J.

13,Persistent fatigue following SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and independent of severity of initial infection,"Fatigue is a common symptom in those presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if COVID-19 results in persistent fatigue in those recovered from acute infection. We examined the prevalence of fatigue in individuals recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 illness using the Chalder Fatigue Score (CFQ-11). We further examined potential predictors of fatigue following COVID-19 infection, evaluating indicators of COVID-19 severity, markers of peripheral immune activation and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of 128 participants (49.5 {+/-} 15 years; 54% female), more than half reported persistent fatigue (52.3%; 45/128) at 10 weeks (median) after initial COVID-19 symptoms. There was no association between COVID-19 severity (need for inpatient admission, supplemental oxygen or critical care) and fatigue following COVID-19. Additionally, there was no association between routine laboratory markers of inflammation and cell turnover (leukocyte, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein) or pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 or sCD25) and fatigue post COVID-19. Female gender and those with a pre-existing diagnosis of depression/anxiety were over-represented in those with fatigue. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness. This study highlights the importance of assessing those recovering from COVID-19 for symptoms of severe fatigue, irrespective of severity of initial illness, and may identify a group worthy of further study and early intervention.","Townsend, L.; Dyer, A.

14,Unemployment insurance and food insecurity among people who lost employment in the wake of COVID-19,"Forty million U.S. residents lost their jobs in the first two months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In response, the Federal Government expanded unemployment insurance benefits in both size ($600 supplement) and scope (to include caregivers and self-employed workers). We assessed the role of unemployment insurance in mitigating the impact of job loss on food insecurity during COVID-19 in low-income households. We analyzed data from the Understanding Coronavirus in America (UAC) cohort, a longitudinal survey collected by the University of Southern California Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) every two weeks between April 1 and July 8, 2020. We limited the sample to individuals living in households earning less than $75,000 in February 2020 who lost their jobs during COVID-19. Using difference-in-differences and event study regression models, we evaluated the association between receipt of unemployment insurance and self-reported food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints. We found that 40.5% of those living in households earning less than $75,000 and employed in February 2020 experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who lost their jobs, 31% reported food insecurity and 33% reported eating less due to financial constraints. Food insecurity peaked in April 2020 and declined over time, but began to increase again among people receiving unemployment insurance during the final wave of the survey ahead of the federal supplement to unemployment insurance ending. Food insecurity and eating less were more common among people who were non-White, lived in lower-income households, younger, and who were sexual or gender minorities. Receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.4 percentage point (95% CI: -7.8 to -0.9 percentage points) decline in food insecurity (a 30.3% relative decline compared to the average level of food insecurity during the study period). Receipt of unemployment insurance was also associated with a 6.1 percentage point (95% CI: -9.6 to -2.7 percentage point) decline in eating less due to financial constraints (a 42% relative decline). Estimates from event study specifications revealed that reductions in food insecurity and eating less were greatest in the four-week period immediately following receipt of unemployment insurance, with no evidence of differential pre-existing trends in either outcome. We conclude that UI benefits during the period when the $600/week federal supplement was in place was associated with large reductions in food insecurity.","Raifman, J.; Bor, J.; Venkataramani, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163618v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163618v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True

When demand for essential resources surpasses availability, difficult triaging decisions are necessary. While algorithms exist, almost nothing is known on societal attitudes regarding triage criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via social media channels to query a broad sample of society. Participants were asked to make triage decisions in case-based vignettes, exploring a variety of factors. They also were asked to assess how sure they were about their decisions, and how such decisions should be reached. Results: The survey was completed in full by 1626 participants in April 2020. Median age was 39 years (range 12-80 years), 984 (61%) were female. Patient prognosis, responsibility towards others, the absence of behavior-induced co-morbidities, and younger age were rated the most important triage criteria, while participants found that insurance status, social status, and nationality should not play a substantial role. Ethics-committees and point systems were regarded potentially helpful for triage decision-making, while decisions based on order of presentation (first-come first-serve) or on a legal basis were viewed critically. Participants were least sure about their decision when dealing with age or behavior-induced co-morbidities. Overall, women were surer about their decisions than men, participants of Christian faith were also more secure about their decision than atheists-agnostics. Conclusions: This study uses social media to generate insight into public opinion and attitudes regarding triage criteria and modalities. These findings may be helpful for the development of future medical triage algorithms.","Muensterer, O. J.; Gianicolo, E. A.; Paul, N.

16,"A Next Generation Bivalent Human Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine Delivering Both Spike and Nucleocapsid Antigens Elicits Th1 Dominant CD4+, CD8+ T-cell and Neutralizing Antibody Responses","In response to the health crisis presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid development of safe and effective vaccines that elicit durable immune responses is imperative. Recent reports have raised the concern that antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients may not be long lasting and thus even these individuals may require vaccination. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical testing have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 wildtype spike (S) protein (S-WT) as the major antigen of choice and while pre-clinical and early clinical testing have shown that S elicits an antibody response, we believe the optimal vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing robust, durable T-cell responses as well as humoral responses. We report here on a next generation bivalent human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) vaccine capable of inducing immunity in patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, comprising both an S sequence optimized for cell surface expression (S-Fusion) and a conserved nucleocapsid (N) antigen designed to be transported to the endosomal subcellular compartment, with the potential to generate durable immune protection. Our studies suggest that this next generation bivalent vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity as evidenced by the following findings: (i) The optimized S-Fusion displayed improved S receptor binding domain (RBD) cell surface expression compared to S-WT where little surface expression was detected; (ii) the expressed RBD from S-Fusion retained conformational integrity and recognition by ACE2-Fc; (iii) the viral N protein modified with an enhanced T-cell stimulation domain (ETSD) localized to endosomal/lysosomal subcellular compartments for MHC I/II presentation; and (iv) these optimizations to S and N (S-Fusion and N-ETSD) generated enhanced de novo antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in antigen-naive pre-clinical models. Both the T-cell and antibody immune responses to S and N demonstrated a T-helper 1 (Th1) bias. The antibody responses were neutralizing as demonstrated by two independent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Based on these findings, we are advancing this next generation bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as our lead clinical candidate to test for its ability to provide robust, durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are ongoing to explore utilizing this vaccine construct in oral, intranasal, and sublingual formulations to induce mucosal immunity in addition to cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The ultimate goal of an ideal COVID-19 vaccine is to generate long-term T and B cell memory.","Rice, A.; Verma, M.; Shin, A.; Zakin, L.; Sieling, P.; Tanaka, S.; Adisetiyo, H.; Taft, J.; Patel, R.

17,A dynamic regulatory interface on SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is the core machinery responsible for the viral genome replication and transcription and also a major antiviral target. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a post-translocated SARS-CoV-2 RdRp core complex, comprising one nsp12, one separate nsp8(I) monomer, one nsp7-nsp8(II) subcomplex and a replicating RNA substrate. Compared with the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complexes, the nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface in this RdRp complex shifts away from the nsp12 polymerase. Further functional characterizations suggest that specific interactions between the nsp8(I) and nsp7, together with the rearrangement of nsp8(I)/nsp7 interface, ensure the efficient and processive RNA synthesis by the RdRp complex. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into how nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors regulate the polymerase activity of nsp12 and suggest a potential new intervention interface, in addition to the canonical polymerase active center, in RdRp for antiviral design.","Shi, W.; Chen, M.; Yang, Y.; Zhou, W.; Chen, S.; Hu, Y.; Liu, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.229187v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.229187v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,False
18,Substrate specificity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 methyltransferase,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies the general need to better understand viral infections. The positive single strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes all viral enzymes. In this work, we focus on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which in complex with nsp10 is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2'-O position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling approach for measurement of 2'-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC50 value of sinefungin (286 +/- 66 nM) to illustrate the value of our approach for inhibitor screening. In the future, this approach can be used for screening inhibitors of any type of 2'-O-MTase.","Benoni, R.; Krafcikova, P.; Baranowski, M.; Kowalska, J.; Boura, E.; Cahova, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.228478v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.228478v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,False
19,Ad26-vector based COVID-19 vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike immunogen induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses,"Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g. prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S1) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively-folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-{gamma}. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).","Bos, R.; Rutten, L.; van der Lubbe, J.

20,Circulating Mitochondrial DNA is an Early Indicator of Severe Illness and Mortality from COVID-19,"Mitochondrial DNA (MT-DNA) are intrinsically inflammatory nucleic acids released by damaged solid organs. Whether circulating MT-DNA levels could be used to predict the development of poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined. Here, we measured circulating MT-DNA levels in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at the time of hospital presentation. Circulating MT-DNA were sharply elevated in patients who eventually died, required ICU admission or intubation. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated MT-DNA levels as an independent risk factor for all of these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Importantly, we found MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area-under-the curve when compared to clinically established inflammatory indicators, as well as emerging markers currently of interest as targets for investigational therapies. These results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential indicator of poor COVID-19 outcomes.","Scozzi, D.; Cano, M.; MA, L.; Zhou, D.; Zhu, J. H.; O'Halloran, J.

21,Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV structural protein antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"There is currently a lack of biological tools to study the replication cycle and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Repurposing the existing tools, including antibodies of SARS-CoV, is an effective way to accelerate the development of therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we extensively characterized antibodies of the SARS-CoV structural proteins for their cross-reactivity, experimental utility, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. We assessed a total of 10 antibodies (six for Spike, two for Membrane, and one for Nucleocapsid and Envelope viral protein). We evaluated the utility of these antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of assays, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, biolayer interferometry, western blots, and micro-neutralization. Remarkably, a high proportion of the antibodies we tested showed cross-reactivity, indicating a potentially generalizable theme of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These antibodies should help facilitate further research into SARS-CoV-2 basic biology. Moreover, our study provides critical information about the propensity of SARS-CoV antibodies to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and highlights its relevance in defining the clinical significance of such antibodies to improve testing and guide the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.","Bates, T.

22,Immuno-informatics Design of a Multimeric Epitope Peptide Based Vaccine Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein,"Developing an efficacious vaccine to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to stem COVID-19 fatalities and providing the global community with immune protection. We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in the design of an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers along with 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC-I and II alleles respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. The vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, with triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations. We therefore propose that potential vaccine designs consider this approach.","Chukwudozie, O. S.; Gray, C. M.; Fagbayi, T. A.; Chukwuanukwu, R. C.; Oyebanji, V. O.; Bankole, T. T.; Adewole, R.

23,EUAdb: a resource for COVID-19 test development,"Due to the sheer number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases, the prevalence of asymptomatic cases and the fact that undocumented cases appear to be significant for transmission of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), there is an urgent need for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capability that is both efficient and effective. In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests that were issued EUAs prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or ""high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests"". By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his/her own research purposes. We ask that the original source of the files be made clear and that the database not be used in its original or modified forms for commercial purposes.","Woronik, A.; Shaffer, H.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses indicate that such receptors are highly expressed in innate immune cells in tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of the above receptors to S is characterized by affinities in the picomolar range and consistent with S glycosylation analysis demonstrating a variety of N- and O-glycans as receptor ligands. These results indicate multiple routes for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with human cells and suggest alternative strategies for therapeutic intervention.","Gao, C.; Zeng, J.; Jia, N.; Stavenhagen, K.; Matsumoto, Y.; Zhang, H.; Li, J.; Hume, A.

27,Mucin-type O-glycosylation Landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins,"The densely glycosylated spike (S) proteins that are highly exposed on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) facilitate viral attachment, entry, and membrane fusion. We have previously reported all the 22 N-glycosites and site-specific N-glycans in the S protein protomer. Herein, we report the comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion using trypsin and trypsin/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6 most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit. Most glycosites were modified by sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2). Our results are the first to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein; clustered O-glycans often occur in the N- and the C-termini of the S protein, and the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions vary with the host cell type. These site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are expected to provide novel insights into the viral binding mechanism and present a strategy for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Y.; Zhao, W.; Mao, Y.; Chen, Y.; Hu, L.; Zhu, J.; Gong, M.; Cheng, J.; Yang, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227785v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.227785v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,False

29,Corticosteroid Use in Severely Hypoxemic COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Cohort Analysis of Dosing Patterns and Outcomes in the Early Phase of the Pandemic,"INTRODUCTION Hypoxemia in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome due to Novel Coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by severe inflammation that may be mitigated by corticosteroids. We evaluated pattern and effects of corticosteroid use in these patients during an early surge of the pandemic. METHODS Observational study of 136 SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to the Intensive care Unit between March 1 and April 27, 2020 at a tertiary care hospital in Indianapolis, USA. Statistical comparison between cohorts and dosing pattern analysis was done. Outcome measures included number of patients requiring intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Of 136 patients, 72 (53%) received corticosteroids. Groups demographics: Age (60.5 vs. 65; p .083), sex (47% male vs. 39% female; p .338) and comorbidities were similar. Corticosteroid group had increased severity of illness: PaO2/FiO2 (113 vs. 130; p .014) and SOFA (8 vs. 5.5; p < .001). Overall mortality (21% vs. 30%; p .234) or proportion of patients intubated (78 vs. 64%; p .078) was similar. Mortality was similar among mechanically ventilated (27% vs. 15%; p .151) however there were no deaths among patients who were not mechanically ventilated and received corticosteroids (0% vs. 57%; p <.001). Early administration (within 48 hours) showed decrease in proportion of intubation (66% vs. 87 vs. 100%; p.045), ICU days (6 vs., 16 vs. 18; p <.001), and ventilator days (3 vs. 12 & 14; p <.001). 45% received methylprednisolone. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids were used more frequently in SARS CoV-2 patients with higher severity of illness. Early administration of corticosteroids improved survival in non-mechanically ventilated patients; decreased ICU stay and may have prevented intubation.","Rahman, O.; Trigonis, R. A.; Craft, M.

31,"Early Clinical Factors Predicting the Development of Critical Disease in Japanese Patients with COVID-19: A Single-Center Retrospective, Observational Study","Background: Insufficient evidence of factors predicting the COVID-19 progression from mild to moderate to critical has been established. We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for critical progression in Japanese COVID-19 patients. Method: Seventy-four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our hospital between February 20, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We excluded asymptomatic, non-Japanese, and child patients. We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (patients requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors in both groups. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and evaluated risk factors by univariate regression. Results: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1% male). The median progression time from symptom onset was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2%), two (3.5%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (COV: 309 U/l), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980/l), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression. However, in Cox proportional hazards analysis, lymphocytopenia at symptom onset was not significant. Conclusions: We identified three candidate risk factors for adult Japanese patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: statin use, elevated LDH level, and decreased eGFR.","Higuchi, T.; Nishida, T.; Iwahashi, H.; Morimura, O.; Otani, Y.; Okauchi, Y.; Yokoe, M.; Suzuki, N.; Inada, M.; Abe, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20159442v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20159442v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
32,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following exposure in school settings: experience from two Helsinki area exposure incidents.,"Background: The role of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unclear. We investigated two COVID-19 school exposure incidents in the Helsinki area. Methods: We conducted two retrospective cohort studies after schools exposures, with a household transmission extension. We defined a case as an exposed person with either a positive RT-PCR, or positive microneutralisation testing (MNT) as confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies detection via fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA). We recruited close school contacts and families of school cases, calculated attack rates (AR) on school level and families, and identified transmission chains. Findings: In incident A, the index was a pupil. Participation rate was 74% (89/121), and no cases were identified. In incident B, the index was a member of school personnel. Participation rate was 81% (51/63). AR was 16% (8/51): 6 pupils and 1 member of school personnel were MNT and FMIA positive; 1 pupil had a positive RT-PCR, but negative serology samples. We visited all school cases' families (n=8). The AR among close household contacts was 42% (9/20 in 3/8 families) but other plausible sources were always reported. At three months post-exposure, 6/8 school cases were re-sampled and still MNT positive. Interpretation: When the index was a child, no school transmission was identified, while the occurrence of an adult case led to a 16% AR. Further cases were evidenced in 3 families, but other transmission chains were plausible. It is likely that transmission from children to adults is limited.

33,An Outpatient Telehealth Elective for Displaced Clinical Learners during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Introduction: In response to the Coronavirus pandemic, medical schools suspended clinical rotations. This displacement of students from the wards has limited experiential learning opportunities. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and shifting towards virtual healthcare. This transition comes with its own logistical challenges. Here, we discuss a workflow that enabled students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping the RWJMS outpatient practices implement remote telehealth visits. Methods: A four-week virtual elective was designed to offer clerkship students the opportunity to participate in virtual telehealth patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to an outpatient workflow that supports healthcare providers in the ambulatory setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video call appointment. Clinical and educational outcomes of students' participation were evaluated. Results: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They also expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telehealth appointments. Students further identified educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person clinical experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned over 80% of patients into virtual provider waiting rooms. Discussion: After piloting this elective with rising fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). An additional telehealth elective is being designed so medical students can contribute to inpatient care without risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. These efforts are designed","Weber, A.

34,COVID-19: Time-Dependent Effective Reproduction Number and Sub-notification Effect Estimation Modeling,"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and health authorities have sought to identify the different parameters that govern their infection and death cycles, in order to be able to make better decisions. In particular, a series of reproduction number estimation models have been presented, with different practical results. Objective: This article aims to present an effective and efficient model for estimating the Reproduction Number and to discuss the impacts of sub-notification on these calculations. Methods: The concept of Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI) is used, as well as a model for Rt, the Reproduction Number, is derived from experimental data. The models are applied to real data and their performance is presented. Results: Analyses on Rt and sub-notification effects for Germany, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, South Korea, and the State of New York are presented to show the performance of the methods here introduced. Conclusions: We show that, with relatively simple mathematical tools, it is possible to obtain reliable values for time-dependent Reproduction Numbers (Rt), as well as we demonstrate that the impact of sub-notification is relatively low, after the initial phase of the epidemic cycle has passed.","De Carvalho, E.

35,Incidence and outcomes of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections: significance of delayed diagnosis and correlation with staff absence,"Background: The sudden increase in COVID-19 admissions in hospitals during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020 has led to onward transmissions among vulnerable inpatients. Aims: This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections (HA-COVID-19) during the 2020 epidemic and study factors which may promote or correlate with its incidence and transmission in a London Teaching Hospital Trust. Methods: Electronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated for the period 1st March to 18th April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as symptom onset >14d of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement and the effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay) on patient outcomes was evaluated. The incidence of staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, community incidence and DRP was compared HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years. Results: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","Khonyongwa, K.; Taori, S. K.; Soares, A.; Desai, N.; Sudhanva, M.; Bernal, W.; Schelenz, S.; Curran, L.

36,"The relationship between demographic, psychosocial and health-related parameters and the impact of COVID-19: a study of twenty-four Indian regions","Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied widely across nations and even in different regions of the same nation. Some of this variability may be due to the interplay of pre-existing demographic, psychological, social and health-related factors in a given population. Methods: Data on the COVID-19 prevalence, crude mortality and case fatality rates were obtained from official government statistics for 24 regions of India. The relationship between these parameters and demographic, social, psychological and health-related indices in these states was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A variety of factors - state population, sex ratio, and burden of diarrhoeal disease and ischemic heart disease - were associated with measures of the impact of COVID-19 on bivariate analyses. On multivariate analyses, prevalence and crude mortality rate were both significantly and negatively associated with the sex ratio. Conclusions: These results suggest that the transmission and impact of COVID-19 in a given population may be influenced by a number of variables, with demographic factors showing the most consistent association.","Rajkumar, R.

37,Association between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization,"Background In observational studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the prognosis of COVID-19 can affect nervous systems. However, the causality between these conditions remains to be determined. Methods This study sought to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of AD with COVID-19 using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results We found that genetically predicted AD was significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 3.329; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.139-9.725; P=0.028). It's interesting that genetically predicted severe COVID-19 was also significantly associated with higher risk of AD (OR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.001-1.007; P=0.018). In addition, the two strong genetic variants associated with severe COVID-19 was associated with higher AD risk (OR, 1.018; 95% CI, 1.003-1.034; P=0.018). There is no evidence to support that genetically predicted AD was significantly associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, and vice versa. No obvious pleiotropy bias and heterogeneity were observed. Conclusion Overall, AD may causally affect severe COVID-19, and vice versa, performing bidirectional regulation through independent biological pathways.","Liu, D.; Zhang, X.; Cao, W.; Zhang, J.; Song, M.; Xing, W.; Wang, W.; Meng, Q.; Wang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20163212v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20163212v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
38,Use of a humanized anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (itolizumab) in elderly patients with moderate COVID-19,"Abstract Introduction: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented. Discussion/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","Ramos-Suzarte, M.; Diaz, Y.; Martin, Y.; Calderon, N.

39,Minimizing Population Health Loss in Times of Scarce Surgical Capacity,"Background COVID-19 has put unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems worldwide, leading to a reduction of the available healthcare capacity. Our objective was to develop a decision model that supports prioritization of care from a utilitarian perspective, which is to minimize population health loss. Methods A cohort state-transition model was developed and applied to 43 semi-elective non-paediatric surgeries commonly performed in academic hospitals. Scenarios of delaying surgery from two weeks were compared with delaying up to one year, and no surgery at all. Model parameters were based on registries, scientific literature, and the World Health Organization global burden of disease study. For each surgery, the urgency was estimated as the average expected loss of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) per month. Results Given the best available evidence, the two most urgent surgeries were bypass surgery for Fontaine III/IV peripheral arterial disease (0.23 QALY loss/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24) and transaortic valve implantation (0.15 QALY loss/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24). The two least urgent surgeries were placing a shunt for dialysis (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.005-0.01) and thyroid carcinoma resection (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.01-0.02): these surgeries were associated with a limited amount of health lost on the waiting list. Conclusion Expected health loss due to surgical delay can be objectively calculated with our decision model based on best available evidence, which can guide prioritization of surgeries to minimize population health loss in times of scarcity. This tool should yet be placed in the context of different ethical perspectives and combined with capacity management tools to facilitate large-scale implementation.","Gravesteijn, B.; Krijkamp, E.; Busschbach, J.; Geleijnse, G.; Retel Helmrich, I.; Bruinsma, S.; van Lint, C.; van Veen, E.; Steyerberg, E.; Verhoef, C.; van Saase, J.; Lingsma, H.; Baatenburg de Jong, R.; Value Based Operation Room Triage team collaborators,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20157040v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20157040v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
40,"Clinical validation of innovative, low cost, kit-free, RNA processing protocol for RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing.","The current gold-standard molecular diagnosis for COVID-19 is based on a multi-step assay involving RNA-extraction and RT-PCR analysis for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. RNA-extraction step has been a major rate-limiting step in implementing high-throughput screening for COVID-19 during this pandemic. Moreover, clinical laboratories are facing several challenges that include cost, reagents, instrumentation, turn-around time, trained personnel, and supply-chain constraints to efficiently implement and sustain testing. Cognizant of these limitations, we evaluated the extraction-free methods described in the literature and have developed an innovative, simplified and easy protocol employing limited reagents to extract RNA for subsequent RT-PCR analysis. Nasopharyngeal-swab samples were subjected to the following individual conditions: 65{degrees}C for 15 minutes; 80{degrees}C for 5 minutes; 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes or 80{degrees}C for 1 minute, and processed for direct RT-PCR. These groups were also compared with a supplemental protocol adding isopropanol-ethanol-water elution steps followed by RT-PCR assay. The direct RT-PCR assay did not detect SARS-CoV-2 within the various temperature incubation only groups, whereas, the 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes-isopropanol-ethanol-water method was found to be comparable to the FDA-EUA method. Evaluation of the performance metrics for 100 clinical samples demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 100%. The limit of detection was ascertained to be ~40 copies/ml by absolute-quantification. The protocol presented for this assay employs limited reagents and yields results with high sensitivity. Additionally, it presents a simplified methodology that would be easier to implement in laboratories in limited resource countries in order to meet the high current COVID-19 testing needs.","Sahajpal, N.

41,Estimates of the rate of infection and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease in a population sample from SE England,"Background: Understanding of the true asymptomatic rate of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is currently limited, as is understanding of the population-based seroprevalence after the first wave of COVID-19 within the UK. The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. Methods: We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. Findings: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. Interpretation: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study.

42,"Nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, and the risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 and all-cause mortality: a nationwide, observational cohort study in France","Abstract Introduction Several studies have reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with Covid-19. However, these studies mostly compared observed to expected rates of smoking without direct comparison with individual controls. Objective To examine the association of nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, with hospitalization and all-cause mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France. Methods We conducted a nationwide matched exposed/unexposed cohort study using information from the French national health data system which covers the entire French population. We conducted two separate analyses, the first in individuals exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy without major smoking-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular and/or respiratory diseases) and the second in those presenting these conditions. We included all individuals, aged between 18 and 75 years, who had been reimbursed at least one nicotine-replacement therapy between November 15, 2019, and February 15, 2020. For each exposed individual, we randomly selected, from the entire Metropolitan French population, up to two non-exposed individuals (1:2) matched for the following variables: age (same year of birth), sex, department of residence (n=96 in Metropolitan France), and complementary universal health insurance (CMU-C). The three end points were a hospitalization with Covid-19, a death or an intubation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, and all-cause mortality. We compared outcomes in individuals who were exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy with those in individuals who were not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results In the first analysis, 297,070 individuals without major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 558,228 unexposed individuals without major smoking-related diseases. Individuals were aged on average 45.6 years (standard deviation: 12.7) and 48.8% were male. From February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020, hospitalization with Covid-19 occurred in 647 patients (151 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 496 patients in the unexposed group). In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 compared with unexposed individuals (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.61). Nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was also associated with a decreased risk of intubation or death in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (13 vs. 73 patients, hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.57) but with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (251 vs. 231 deaths, hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.80). In the second analysis, 128,768 individuals with major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 243,793 unexposed individuals. Individuals were aged on average 55.3 years (standard deviation: 11.4) and 53.3% were male. In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was neither associated with risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 (240 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 398 patients in the unexposed group, hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.38) nor with risk of death or an intubation in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (48 vs. 61 patients, hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.54). All-cause mortality was higher in the nicotine-replacement therapy group (1040 vs. 366 deaths, hazard ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.41 to 4.31). Conclusions This large-scale observational study suggests that smoking, measured by exposure to nicotine-replacement therapy, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, although it was associated with a lower risk of severe Covid-19 in individuals without major related-smoking diseases. Experimental and clinical studies are needed to disentangle the potential mechanisms of nicotine and/or smoking in Covid-19 risk. Whatever the nature of these associations, the global impact of smoking is harmful for health even over a short epidemic period.","Zureik, M.; Baricault, B.; Vabre, C.; SEMENZATO, L.; Drouin, J.; cuenot, F.; penso, L.; Herlemont, P.; Sbidian, E.; Weill, A.; Molimard, M.; Dray-Spira, R.; Botton, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20160630v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20160630v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True

The prevalence of infection varied across centers and ranged from 3.0% to 22.0%, being strongly correlated with that of the respective areas. Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men. Fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, together with anosmia and ageusia. No differences in the risk of infection were detected between job titles, or working in a COVID-19 designated department. Reported contact with a patient inside or outside the workplace was a risk factor. Use of a mask was strongly protective against risk of infection as was use of gloves. The use of a mask by the source of exposure (patient or colleague) had an independent effect in reducing infection risk.","Boffetta, P.; Violante, F.; Durando, P.; De Palma, G.; Pira, E.; Vimercati, L.; Cristaudo, A.; Icardi, G.; Sala, E.; Coggiola, M.; Tafuri, S.; Gattini, V.; Apostoli, P.; Spatari, G.; Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20158717v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20158717v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
44,Multimorbidity patterns among COVID-19 deaths: considerations for a better medical practice,"Medical care of individuals diagnosed with severe COVID-19 is complex, especially when patients are older adults with multimorbidity. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of multimorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19. Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decreases the probability of death among older people. Consider multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the more adequate medical interventions. In addition to the co-occurrence of COVID-19 with diseases of high prevalence in the world, in Colombia there are cases more complex with COVID-19 co-occur with endemic and orphan tropical diseases. In these cases, although its occurrence may be low, clinical management requires adjusting to its complex clinical condition.","Fernandez-Nino, J. A.; Guerra-Gomez, J. A.; Idrovo-Velandia, A.

45,Stochastic modelling of the effects of human-mobility restriction and viral infection characteristics on the spread of COVID-19,"After several weeks of ""lockdown"" as the sole answer to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries are restarting their economic and social activities. However, balancing the re-opening of society against the implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures needed for minimizing interpersonal contacts requires a careful assessment of the risks of infection as a function of the confinement relaxation strategies. Here, we present a stochastic coarse grained model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategy. In line with general expectations, our model predicts that a full lockdown yields the best results, namely, the lowest number of total infections. A less anticipated result was that when personal mobility is increased beyond a critical level, the risk of infection rapidly reaches a constant value, which depends solely on the population density. Furthermore, according to our model, confinement alone is not effective if it is not accompanied by a detection capacity (coupled with quarantine) that surpasses 40% of the patients during their symptomatic phase. The results of our simulation also showed that keeping the virus transmission probability to less than 0.4, which can be achieved in real life by respecting social distancing or wearing masks, is as effective as imposing a mild lockdown. Finally, we note that detection and quarantine of pre-symptomatic patients, even with a probability as low as 0.2, would reduce the final numbers of infections by a factor of ten or more.","Ando, S.; Matsuzawa, Y.; Tsurui, H.; Mizutani, T.; Hall, D.; Kuroda, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163980v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163980v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True

COVID-19 is announced as a global pandemic by World Health Organization. COVID-19 is characterized by severe conditions and early diagnosis can make dramatic changes both for personal and public health. In order to increase the reach for low cost equipment which requires a very limited technical knowledge can be beneficial to diagnose the viral infection. Such diagnostic capabilities can have a very critical role to control the transmission of the disease. Here we are reporting a state-of-the-art diagnostic tool developed by using an in vitro synthetic biology approach by employing engineered de novo riboregulators. Our design coupled with a home-made point-of-care device setting can detect and report presence of Sars-CoV-2 specific genes. The presence of Sars-CoV-2 related genes triggers translation of sfGFP mRNAs, resulting in green fluorescence output. The approach proposed here has the potential of being a game changer in Sars-COV-2 diagnostics by providing an easy-to-run, low-cost-demanding diagnostic capability.","Koksaldi, I. C.; Ahan, R.

49,Mechanistic modelling of coronavirus infections and the impact of confined neighbourhoods on a short time scale,"Background: To mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, some countries have adopted more stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions in contrast to those widely used (for e.g. the state of Kuwait). In addition to standard practices such as enforcing curfews, social distancing, and closure of non-essential service industries, other non-conventional policies such as the total confinement of highly populated areas has also been implemented. Methods: In this paper, we model the movement of a host population using a mechanistic approach based on random walks, which are either diffusive or super-diffusive. Infections are realised through a contact process, whereby a susceptible host may be infected if in close spatial proximity of the infectious host. Our focus is only on the short-time scale prior to the infectious period, so that no further transmission is assumed. Results: We find that the level of infection depends heavily on the population dynamics, and increases in the case of slow population diffusion, but remains stable for a high or super-diffusive population. Also, we find that the confinement of homogeneous or overcrowded sub-populations has minimal impact in the short term. Conclusions: Our results indicate that on a short time scale, confinement restrictions or complete lock down of whole residential areas may not be effective. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for total confinement in the context of the current situation in Kuwait.","Ahmed, D. A.; Ansari, A.

50,"Performance of Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, and Euroimmun Assays in Detecting Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Background: Several serological assays have been developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, but evidence about their comparative performance is limited. We sought to assess the sensitivity of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We obtained sera from 36 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. We evaluated samples collected at around 21 days ({+/-}14 days) after their initial PCR test using 3 commercially available ELISA assays, two anti-spike (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros, and Euroimmun) and one anti-nucleocapsid (Abbott Architect), and a Yale-developed anti-spike ELISA test. We determined the sensitivity of the tests and compared their results. The Euroimmun and Yale ELISA had an equivocal and indeterminate category, which were considered as both negative and positive. Results: Among the 36 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean age was 43 ({+/-}13) years and 19 (53%) were female. The sensitivities of the tests were not significantly different (Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, Euroimmmun, and Yale assays: 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-95), 94% (95% CI, 81-99), 86% (95% CI, 71-95), and 94% (95% CI, 81-99), respectively; p-value=0.464). The sensitivities of the Euroimmun and Yale ELISA tests increased when the equivocal/indeterminate results were considered positive (97% [95% CI, 85-100] and 100% [95% CI, 90-100], respectively), but were not significantly different from other tests (p=0.082). The cross-correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85-0.98 between three anti-spike protein assays (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, Yale) and was 0.58-0.71 between the three anti-spike protein assays and the anti-nucleocapsid assay (Abbott). Conclusion: The sensitivities of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein assays did not significantly differ, although the sample size was small. Sensitivity also depended on the interpretation of equivocal and indeterminate results. The strongest correlations were present for the three anti-spike proteins assays. These findings suggest that individual test characteristics and the correlation between different tests should be considered when comparing or aggregating data across different populations studies for serologic surveillance of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mahajan, S.; Redlich, C.

51,Determining the period of communicability of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review of the literature,"Introduction: How long individuals may transmit virus after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Understanding the communicability period of SARS-CoV-2 is important to inform the period of isolation required to prevent nosocomial and community spread. The objective of this study was to identify the reported communicable period of SARS-CoV-2, based on a rapid review of existing literature. Methods: Studies reporting empirical data on the period of communicability of SARS-CoV-2 through investigations of duration of communicability based on in-person contact ('contact transmission'), isolation and culture of virus ('viral isolation'), and viral shedding by detection of nucleic acids by RT-PCR ('viral shedding') were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, medRxiv and arXiv) and the grey literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analyzed, and synthesized. Results: Out of the 165 studies included for qualitative analysis, one study investigated contact transmission, three investigated viral isolation, 144 investigated viral shedding, and 17 studies focused on both viral shedding and viral isolation. The median length of time until viral clearance across all viral isolation studies was nine days; however, the maximum identified duration was 32 days. Studies with data on both viral isolation and viral shedding showed a prolonged maximum time until viral clearance for viral shedding (9 days vs 24 days). Discussion: Findings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation; however, additional observation should be considered for individuals being released into high-risk settings.","Park, M.; Pawliuk, C.; Nguyen, T.; Griffitt, A.; Dix-Cooper, L.; Fourik, N.; Dawes, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163873v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163873v1?rss=1,2020-07-30,2020-07-30,,True
52,Reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in metropolitan regions,"The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking public health, social, and economic havoc across the globe, and to date a variety of strategies have been implemented to attempt to control the spread of disease [1, 2]. A critical unknown for policy planning is the number of people who have been infected and are no longer susceptible [3]. Tests for active SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibody presence can provide an indication, but both are prone to selection bias, under-representative population sampling and insufficient reliability [4, 5]. Here, we present an alternative to determine residual susceptibilities based on the analysis of observed population-wide disease dynamics data. For four highly-affected countries, we directly compared the dynamics in the largest metropolitan regions with the rest of the countries. We show that substantial susceptibility reductions are measurable in the metropolitan regions, which all continued in a phase of exponential growth of case numbers for a relatively longer time before public health interventions were introduced. Compared to these interventions, the reduction in metropolitan region susceptibility had a substantial role in the post-growth decline in infection rates. Reduced population susceptibility has far reaching consequences on future policy responses and disease forecasts including vaccine trial planning and, in the case of a second epidemic wave, higher population-normalised mortality rates for non-metropolitan regions.","Barrett, T.

53,The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2: a scoping review of available evidence,"Background: The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 determines both the ability of the virus to invade a population and the strength of intervention that would be required to contain or eliminate the spread of infection. The basic reproduction number, R0, provides a quantitative measure of the transmission potential of a pathogen. Objective: Conduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter. Design: Scoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020. Data sources: Both peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Selection criteria: Studies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (lockdown), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0. Results: A total of 20 R0 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth. Conclusions: The variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.","Barber, A.; Griffin, J.

54,The Role of Weather Conditions in COVID-19 Transmission: A Study of a Global Panel of 1236 Regions,"Weather condition may impact COVID-19 transmission. The effects of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission are not clear due to the difficulties in separating impacts of social distancing. We collected COVID-19 data and social-economic features of 1236 regions in the world (1112 regions at the provincial level and 124 countries with small land area). Moreover, a large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk due to temperature change driven by seasonal cycles. The result showed every degree Celsius increase in average temperature appears to cause a 2.88% decrease in the fraction of new daily cases 6 days later and a 0.62 percent point decrease in the reproductive number (R0). Every percentage point increase in relative humidity is found to lead to a 0.19% decrease in the fraction of new daily cases and a 0.02 percent point decrease in R0 6 days later. Further, the effect of temperature and humidity is near to linear based on our samples. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to the decrease the new daily case ratio. The conclusions withstand several robustness checks, such as observation scales and maximum/minimum temperature. The conclusion indicates air temperature and relative humidity are shown to be negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Given the diversity in both climate and social-economic conditions, the risk of transmission varies globally and possibly amplifies existing global health inequalities. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the mitigation of the spreading of the virus.","Zhang, C.; Liao, H.; Strol, E.; Li, H.; Li, R.; Jensen, S.

56,ACE2 Expression is elevated in Airway Epithelial Cells from aged and male donors but reduced in asthma,"Rationale: COVID-19 is complicated by acute lung injury, and death in some individuals. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter airway epithelial cells (AECs). Objective: To determine what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: We obtained upper and lower AECs from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89, Newcastle (n=115), and from Perth (n= 30) Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n=37) and COPD (n=38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry were assessed by quantitative PCR, protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AECs. Results: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (p=0.02) and male sex (p=0.03), but not pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma (p=0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in asthma (p=0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface was increased (p=0.02). ACE2 protein levels were lower in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients. Conclusions: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.","Wark, P.; Pathinyake, P.; Kaiko, G.; Nichol, K.; Ali, A.; Chen, L.; Suntanto, E.; Garrat, L.; Sohal, S.

57,Baseline Cardiometabolic Profiles and SARS-CoV-2 Risk in the UK Biobank,"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus with a high incidence of severe upper respiratory infection that first presented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), but little investigation has been done to investigate dysregulation of lipid profiles and diabetes, which are often comorbid in high BMI patients. Objective This study seeks to describe the impact of BMI, HDL, LDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes, alcohol and red wine intake on SARS-CoV-2 risk in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. Methods We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the risk of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through June 29, 2020. Logistic regression was performed on the target variables controlling for age, sex and ancestry. Results BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05) while HDL and ApoA were associated with decreased risk (p < 0.001). Additionally, red wine intake was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05). LDL, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased risk. Conclusion Elevated HDL and ApoA levels and alcohol intake, specifically red wine intake, were associated with reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased risk. The effects of alcohol, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels may be indirect, mediated in part through regulation of HDL levels. In summary, our study corroborates the emerging picture that high HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Scalsky, R. J.; Desai, K.; Chen, Y.-J.; O'Connell, J. R.; Perry, J.

58,"Descriptive epidemiology of 16,780 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States","BACKGROUND: Despite the significant morbidity and mortality caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), our understanding of basic disease epidemiology remains limited. This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5%), overweight or obese (72.1%), or had hypertension (58.1%). At admission, 29.1% of patients presented with fever (>38 C) and 30.6% had low oxygen saturation (<90%).

59,Resveratrol and Copper for treatment of severe COVID-19: an observational study (RESCU 002),"Background To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies, especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper. Methods & Findings Our analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April 1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care, resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every 6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies, and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020. The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7/30 (23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI 1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267) were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death. There was a trend towards reduction in death in patients receiving resveratrol-copper (OR 0.413, 95% CI 0.164-1.039, P= 0.0604). Conclusions We provide preliminary results of a novel approach to the treatment of severe COVID-19 using a combination of small amounts of commonly used nutraceuticals, which is non-toxic and inexpensive, and therefore could be widely accessible globally. The nearly two-fold reduction in mortality with resveratrol-copper observed in our study needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.","Mittra, I.; de Souza, R.; Bhadade, R.; Madke, T.; Shankpal, P.

60,How much reserve capacity is justifiable for hospital pandemic preparedness? A cost-effectiveness analysis for COVID-19 in Germany,"Introduction: In preparation for a possible second COVID-19 pandemic wave, expanding intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity is an important consideration. The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of this strategy in Germany. Methods: This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. Results: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of supplying one additional ICU bed is 24,815 euros per life year gained and increases with the number of additional beds. The NMB remains positive for utilization rates as low as 1.5% and, assuming full capacity utilization, for multiples of the currently available bed capacity. Expanding the ICU bed capacity by 10,000 beds is projected to result in societal costs of 41 billion euros and to reduce mortality of ICU candidates by 20% compared with no intervention (assuming full capacity utilization). In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. Conclusions: In Germany, the provision of additional ICU bed capacity appears to be cost-effective over a large increase in the number of beds. Nevertheless, bed utilization is constrained by labor supply and possibly other input factors.","Gandjour, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162743v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162743v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

Moreover, studies indicate that most asymptomatic virus-positive patients are infectious, thereby creating a new public health danger via a plethora of ""silent spreaders."" This data science study identified four novel discoveries that may significantly impact our understanding of the pathogen-immune relationship: (1) Spearman rho correlation coefficients and associated P-values identified 33 of 55 common immune factors have statistically significant associations with SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, their direction (+/-) and strength to inform research and therapies; (2) five machine learning algorithms were applied to 74 observations of these 33 immunological variables and identified three models of prognostic biomarkers that can classify and predict who will be asymptomatic or symptomatic if infected with 94.8% to 100% accuracy; (3) a random forest of 200 decision trees ordinally ranked the 33 statistically significant independent predictor variables by their relative importance in predicting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms; and, (4) three different decision-tree algorithms separately identified and validated three immunological biomarkers and levels that nearly always differentiate asymptomatic patients: SCGF-Beta; (> 127637), IL-16 (> 45), and M-CSF (> 57).

62,Efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab in patients with severe Covid -19,"On the basis of Covid-19-induced pulmonary pathological and vascular changes, we hypothesized that the anti-VEGF drug bevacizumab might be beneficial for treating Covid-19 patients. We recruited 26 patients from 2-centers (China and Italy) with confirmed severe Covid-19, with respiratory rate [&ge;]30 times/min, oxygen saturation [&le;]93% with ambient air, or partial arterial oxygen pressure to fraction of inspiration O2 ratio (PaO2/FiO2) >100mmHg and [&le;]300 mmHg, and diffuse pneumonia confirmed by chest radiological imaging. This trial was conducted from Feb 15 to April 5, 2020, and followed up for 28 days. Relative to comparable control patients with severe Covid-19 admitted in the same centers, bevacizumab showed clinical efficacy by improving oxygenation and shortening oxygen-support duration. Among 26 hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 (median age, 62 years, 20 [77%] males), bevacizumab plus standard care markedly improved the PaO2/FiO2 ratios at days 1 and 7 (elevated values, day 1, 50.5 [4.0,119.0], p<0.001; day 7, 111.0 [85.0,165.0], p<0.001). By day 28, 24 (92%) patients showed improvement in oxygen-support status, 17 (65%) patients were discharged, and none showed worsen oxygen-support status nor died. Significant reduction of lesion areas and ratios were shown in chest CT or X-ray analysis within 7 days. Of 14 patients with fever, body temperature normalized within 72 hours in 13 (93%) patients. Lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood were significantly increased and CRP levels were markedly decreased as shown in available data. Our findings suggested bevacizumab plus standard care was highly beneficial for treating patients with severe Covid-19.

Their performance was evaluated in a cohort of 350 convalescent participants with previous COVID-19 infection, ranging from asymptomatic to critical cases. We mapped the antibody responses to different areas on protein N and S and showed that the IgM, A and G antibody responses against RBD are significantly correlated to the disease severity.

Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 minute gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.4 % sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique.

66,Endpoint PCR Detection of Sars-CoV-2 RNA,"Quantitative real-time PCR methods have been used to perform approximately 278 million tests for COVID-19 up to mid-July 2020. Real-time PCR involves a rate limiting step where the samples are measured in situ during each PCR amplification cycle. This creates a bottleneck limiting scalability and as a consequence reducing access to inexpensive reliable testing at national and international scales. We investigated endpoint PCR for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on synthetic RNA standards and hospital patient samples. The endpoint PCR detection limit is constrained only by the stochastics of low copy numbers and reliably detected single copies of synthetic RNA standards. On a set of 30 patient samples, endpoint PCR found one additional positive sample and was able to confirm an indeterminate sample as negative. These results were found using 4 l reagent and 1 l of sample representing an 80% reduction relative to the NHS protocol (20 l reagent and 5 l sample). These results indicate that endpoint PCR should be the method of choice for large scale testing programmes. Based on the experience from ultra-high throughput genotyping efforts a single workflow using 384-well plates has similar PCR capacity (250 Million) to that required for all testing done worldwide during the first 7 month of the pandemic.","Moses, S.

67,The German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO): A standardized dataset for COVID-19 research,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of research activity. While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the ""German Corona Consensus Dataset"" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data. Methods: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. Results: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to predict host factors that play a specific role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, distinct from other respiratory viruses. We identified differentially expressed genes, isoforms and transposable element families specifically altered in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Well-known immunoregulators including CSF2, IL-32, IL-6 and SERPINA3 were differentially expressed, while immunoregulatory transposable element families were overexpressed. We predicted conserved interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and human RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA1, PABPC1 and eIF4b, which may play important roles in the viral life cycle. We also detected four viral sequence variants in the spike, polymerase, and nonstructural proteins that correlate with severity of COVID-19.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro infection of whole PBMCs from healthy donors was productive of virus progeny. Results revealed that monocytes, as well as B and T lymphocytes, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 active infection and viral replication was indicated by detection of double-stranded RNA. Moreover, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was frequently detected in monocytes and B lymphocytes from COVID-19 patients, and less frequently in CD4+T lymphocytes. The rates of SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients increased over time from symptom onset. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes and B and CD4+T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry in post mortem lung tissue.

71,On the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 retention in the upper respiratory tract,"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. At low pH, binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release. Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended periods of shedding. Implications to combat pandemics that, like SARS-CoV-2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates due to retention in nasal epithelium and their evolutionary origin are discussed.","Paris, K.

72,Impact Analysis of SARS-CoV2 on Signaling Pathways during COVID19 Pathogenesis using Codon Usage Assisted Host-Viral Protein Interactions,"Understanding the molecular mechanism of COVID19 disease pathogenesis helps in the rapid development of therapeutic targets. Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The pathogen may target cell signaling pathways to disrupt the pathway genes' regular activities, resulting in disease. Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the host-viral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein. Extensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease.

73,Understanding the patterns of repeated testing for COVID-19: Association with patient characteristics and outcomes,"Importance The diagnostic tests for COVID-19 have a high false negative rate, but not everyone with an initial negative result is re-tested. Michigan Medicine, being one of the primary regional centers accepting COVID-19 cases, provided an ideal setting for studying COVID-19 repeated testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic. Objective To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with patient characteristics and with downstream outcomes among positive cases. Design This cross-sectional study described the pattern of testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine. The main hypothesis under consideration is whether patient characteristics differed between those tested once and those who underwent multiple tests. We then restrict our attention to those that had at least one positive test and study repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19 related outcomes (testing positive, hospitalization and ICU care). Setting Demographic and clinical characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for 15,920 patients presenting to Michigan Medicine between March 10 and June 4, 2020 for a diagnostic test for COVID-19 were collected from their electronic medical records on June 24, 2020. Data on the number and types of tests administered to a given patient, as well as the sequences of patient-specific test results were derived from records of patient laboratory results. Participants Anyone tested between March 10 and June 4, 2020 at Michigan Medicine with a diagnostic test for COVID-19 in their Electronic Health Records were included in our analysis. Exposures Comparison of repeated testing across patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and patient outcomes Main Outcomes and Measures Whether patients underwent repeated diagnostic testing for SARS CoV-2 in Michigan Medicine Results Between March 10th and June 4th, 19,540 tests were ordered for 15,920 patients, with most patients only tested once (13596, 85.4%) and never testing positive (14753, 92.7%). There were 5 patients who got tested 10 or more times and there were substantial variations in test results within a patient. After fully adjusting for patient and neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and demographic characteristics, patients with circulatory diseases (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: (1.18, 1.72)), any cancer (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: (1.01, 1.29)), Type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: (1.06, 1.39)), kidney diseases (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: (1.71, 2.23)), and liver diseases (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: (1.11, 1.50)) were found to have higher odds of undergoing repeated testing when compared to those without. Additionally, as compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks were found to have higher odds (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: (1.03, 1.43)) of receiving additional testing. Females were found to have lower odds (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: (0.76, 0.96)) of receiving additional testing than males. Neighborhood poverty level also affected whether to receive additional testing. For 1% increase in proportion of population with annual income below the federal poverty level, the odds ratio of receiving repeated testing is 1.01 (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: (1.00, 1.01)). Focusing on only those 1167 patients with at least one positive result in their full testing history, patient age in years (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: (1.00, 1.03)), prior history of kidney diseases (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: (1.36, 3.41)) remained significantly different between patients who underwent repeated testing and those who did not. After adjusting for both patient demographic factors and NSES, hospitalization (OR: 7.44; 95% CI: (4.92, 11.41)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6.97; 95% CI: (4.48, 10.98)) were significantly associated with repeated testing. Of these 1167 patients, 306 got repeated testing and 1118 tests were done on these 306 patients, of which 810 (72.5%) were done during inpatient stays, substantiating that most repeated tests for test positive patients were done during hospitalization or ICU care. Additionally, using repeated testing data we estimate the ""real world"" false negative rate of the RT-PCR diagnostic test was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)). Conclusions and Relevance This study sought to quantify the pattern of repeated testing for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine. While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset of patients (2324, 14.6% of the population who got tested) underwent multiple rounds of testing (5,944 tests were done in total on these 2324 patients, with an average of 2.6 tests per person), with 10 or more tests for five patients. Both hospitalizations and ICU care differed significantly between patients who underwent repeated testing versus those only tested once as expected. These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding the variation of repeated testing results within and between patients.","Salerno, S.; Zhao, Z.; Prabhu Sankar, S.; Salvatore, M.; Gu, T.; Fritsche, L.

74,Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and cigarette smoke increases infection severity and alters the stemcell-derived airway repair response,"Most demographic studies are now associating current smoking status with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality from the disease but there remain many questions about how direct cigarette smoke exposure affects SARS-CoV-2 airway cell infection. We directly exposed mucociliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term cigarette smoke and infected them with live SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after cigarette smoke exposure as well as an increased number of apoptotic cells. Cigarette smoke exposure alone caused airway injury that resulted in an increased number of ABSCs, which proliferate to repair the airway. But we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or the combination of exposure to cigarette smoke and SARS-CoV-2 did not induce ABSC proliferation. We set out to examine the underlying mechanism governing the increased susceptibility of cigarette smoke exposed ALI to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell profiling of the cultures showed that infected airway cells displayed a global reduction in gene expression across all airway cell types. Interestingly, interferon response genes were induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells in the ALI cultures but smoking exposure together with SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced the interferon response. Treatment of cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures with Interferon {beta}-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting that the lack of interferon response in the cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures allows for more severe viral infection and cell death. In summary, our data show that acute smoke exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke.","Purkayastha, A.; Sen, C.; Garcia, G.; Langerman, J.; Vijayaraj, P.; Shia, D.

75,Intradermal-delivered DNA vaccine provides anamnestic protection in a rhesus macaque SARS-CoV-2 challenge model,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a dramatic global impact on public health, social, and economic infrastructures. Here, we assess immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)-delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800. INO-4800 is an ID-delivered DNA vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. These responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of virus. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.","Patel, A.; Walters, J.; Reuschel, E.

76,Divide in Vaccine Belief in COVID-19 Conversations: Implications for Immunization Plans,"The development of a viable COVID-19 vaccine is a work in progress, but the success of the immunization campaign will depend upon public acceptance. In this paper, we classify Twitter users in COVID-19 discussion into vaccine refusers (anti-vaxxers) and vaccine adherers (vaxxers) communities. We study the divide between anti-vaxxers and vaxxers in the context of whom they follow. More specifically, we look at followership of 1) the U.S. Congress members, 2) four major religions (Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism and Islam), 3) accounts related to the healthcare community, and 4) news media accounts. Our results indicate that there is a partisan divide between vaxxers and anti-vaxxers. We find a religious community with a higher than expected fraction of anti-vaxxers. Further, we find that the variance of vaccine belief within the news media accounts operated by Russian and Iranian governments is higher compared to news media accounts operated by other governments. Finally, we provide messaging and policy implications to inform the COVID-19 vaccine and future vaccination plans.","Tyagi, A.; Carley, K.

77,The genetic variants analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh.,"Genomic mutation of the virus may impact the viral adaptation to the local environment, their transmission, disease manifestation, and the effectiveness of existing treatment and vaccination. The objectives of this study were to characterize genomic variations, non-synonymous amino acid substitutions especially in target proteins, mutation events per samples, rate, and overall scenario of coronaviruses across the country. To investigate the genetic diversity, a total of 184 genomes of virus strains sampled from different divisions of Bangladesh with sampling dates between 10 May 2019 and 27 June 2020 were analyzed. To date, a total of 634 mutations located along the entire genome resulting in nonsynonymous 274 amino acid substitutions in 22 different proteins were detected. The mutation rate estimated to be 23.715 substitutions per year. The highest non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were observed at 48 different positions of the papain-like protease (nsp3). Although no mutations were observed in nsp7, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp11, yet orf1ab accounts for 56% of total mutations. Among the structural proteins, the highest mutations at 36 different positions have identified in spike proteins. A total of 9 mutations at spike proteins were found unique in relative to the global mutations including mutations at position 516 in the boundary of the ACE2 binding region of the spike protein. The most dominated variant G614 (95%) based in spike protein is circulating across the country followed by coevolving other variants including L323 (94%) in RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), K203 (82%) and R204 (82%) in nucleocapsid, and F120 (78%) in NSP2. These variants are mostly seen as linked mutations and are part of a haplotype observed high in Europe. Data suggest effective containment of clade G strains (4.8%) with sub-clusters GR covered by 82.4%, and GH clade 6.4%. Whereas 2.7 and 3.2 % of variants belonged to clade S and O clade, respectively.","Mahmud, A. S. M.; Taznin, T.; Sarkar, M. M. H.; Uzzaman, M. S.; Osman, E.; Habib, M. A.; Akter, S.; Banu, T.

79,Allosteric inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease - insights from mass spectrometry-based assays,"Following translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome into two viral polypeptides, the main protease Mpro cleaves at eleven sites to release non-structural proteins required for viral replication. MPro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19). Here, we have used native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of Mpro. Analysis of the monomer-dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of Kd = 0.14 {+/-} 0.03 M, revealing MPro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS-based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme-substrate complexes, which are effectively ""flash-frozen"" as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x-ray crystal structures of these enzyme-small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate MPro activity.","El-Baba, T.

80,Structural and functional analysis of female sex hormones against SARS-Cov2 cell entry,"Emerging evidence suggests that males are more susceptible to severe infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus than females. A variety of mechanisms may underlie the observed gender-related disparities including differences in sex hormones. However, the precise mechanisms by which female sex hormones may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further observed that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results shed light on a putative mechanism whereby female sex hormones may provide protection from developing severe infection and could inform the development of future therapies against COVID-19.","Aguilar Pineda, J.; Albaghdadi, M.; Jiang, W.; Vera Lopez, K.

81,A Retrospective Study on Efficacy and Safety of Guduchi Ghan Vati for Covid-19 Asymptomatic Patients,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety, preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19. Methods Objective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively. Results In control group, 11.7% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5% vs 15.6% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100% vs 82.3%) days to stay in hospital ( 6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p< 0.0001) .

82,"Serial population based serosurvey of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a low and high transmission area of Karachi, Pakistan","Background Pakistan is among the first low- and middle-income countries affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Monitoring progress through serial sero-surveys, particularly at household level, in densely populated urban communities can provide insights in areas where testing is non-uniform. Methods Two serial cross-sectional household surveys were performed in April (phase 1) and June (phase 2) 2020 each in a low- (District Malir) and high-transmission (District East) area of Karachi, Pakistan. Household were selected using simple random sampling (Malir) and systematic random sampling (East). Individual participation rate from consented households was 82.3% (1000/1215 eligible) in phase 1 and 76.5% (1004/1312 eligible) in phase 2. All household members or their legal guardians answered questions related to symptoms of Covid-19 and provided blood for testing with commercial Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay targeting combined IgG and IgM. Seroprevalence estimates were computed for each area and time point independently. Given correlation among household seropositivity values, a Bayesian regression model accounting for household membership, age and gender was used to estimate seroprevalence. These estimates by age and gender were then post-stratified to adjust for the demographic makeup of the respective district. The household conditional risk of infection was estimated for each district and its confidence interval were obtained using a non-parametric bootstrap of households. Findings Post-stratified seroprevalence was estimated to be 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) in low-and 0.4% (95% CI 0 - 1.3) in high-transmission areas in phase 1 and 8.7% (95% CI 5.1-13.1) in low- and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4 -21.7) in high-transmission areas in phase 2, with no consistent patterns between prevalence rates for males and females. Conditional risk of infection estimates (possible only for phase 2) were 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) in low- and 0.41(95% CI 0.28-0.52) in high-transmission areas. Of the 166 participants who tested positive, only 9(5.4%) gave a history of any symptoms. Interpretation A large increase in seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 infection is seen, even in areas where transmission is reported to be low. Mostly the population is still seronegative. A large majority of seropositives do not report any symptoms. The probability that an individual in a household is infected, given that another household member is infected is high in both the areas. These results emphasise the need to enhance surveillance activities of COVID-19 especially in low-transmission sites and provide insights to risks of household transmission in tightly knit neighbourhoods in urban LMIC settings.","Nisar, M.

84,"Impact Assessment of Full and Partial Stay-at-Home Orders, Face Mask Usage, and Contact Tracing: An Agent-Based Simulation Study of COVID-19 for an Urban Region","Purpose: Various social intervention strategies to mitigate COVID-19 are examined using a comprehensive agent-based simulation model. A case study is conducted using a large urban region, Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Results are intended to serve as a planning guide for public health decision-makers. Methods: The simulation model mimics the daily social mixing behavior of the susceptible and infected generating the spread. Data representing demographics of the region, virus epidemiology, and social interventions shapes model behavior. Results include daily values of infected, reported, hospitalized, and dead. Results: Study results show that stay-at-home order is quite effective in flattening and then reversing the case growth curve subsiding the pandemic with only 5.8% of the population infected. Whereas, following the current Phase II reopening plan could end the pandemic via herd immunity with 75% people infected. Use of surgical variety face masks reduced infected by 20%. A further reduction of 66% was achieved through contact tracing. Conclusions: For Miami-Dade County, a strategy comprising mandatory use of face masks and aggressive contact tracing to identify 50% of the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, if adopted now, can potentially steer the COVID-19 pandemic to subside within next 3 months with approximately one-fifth of the population infected.","Tatapudi, H.; Das, R.; Das, T.

85,Comorbidities associated with regional variations in COVID-19 mortality revealed by population-level analysis,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has developed into a global health crisis. Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes of COVID-19 is thus important for successful management and control of the pandemic. However, the progress and severity of the epidemic across different regions show great differentiations. We hypothesized the origination of these differences are based on location-dependent variations in underlying population-wide health factors. Disease prevalence or incidence data of states and counties of the United States were collected for a group of chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, physical inactivation, and common cancers (e.g., lung, colorectal, stomach, kidney and renal). Correlation and regression analysis identified the prevalence of heart failure as a significant positive factor for region-level COVID-19 mortality. Similarly, the incidence of gastric cancer and thyroid cancer were also identified as significant factors contributing to regional variation in COVID-19 mortality. To explore the implications of these results, we re-analyzed the RNA-seq data for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and colon carcinoma (COAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We found that expression of genes in the immune response pathways were more severely disturbed in STAD than in COAD, implicating higher probability for STAD patients or individuals with precancerous chronic stomach diseases to develop cytokine storm once infected with COVID-19. Taken together, we conclude that location variations in particular chronic diseases and cancers contribute significantly to the regional variations in COVID-19 mortality.","Yang, H.; Zhong, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20158105v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20158105v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True
86,The effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 and its relationship with social distancing,"The expansion of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) triggered a renewed public interest in epidemiological models and on how parameters can be estimated from observed data. Here we investigated the relationship between average number of transmissions though time, the reproductive number Rt, and social distancing index as reported by mobile phone data service inloco, for Goias State, Brazil, between March and June 2020. We calculated Rt values using EpiEstim package in R-plataform for confirmed cases incidence curves. We found a correlation equal to -0.72 between Rt values for confirmed cases and isolation index at a time lag of 8 days. As the Rt values were paired with center of the moving window of 7 days, the delay matches the mean incubation period of the virus. Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more importantly, can be an useful metrics for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in public health.","Jardim, L.; Diniz-Filho, J.

87,Prevalence of amyloid blood clots in COVID-19 plasma,"The rapid detection of COVID-19 uses genotypic testing for the presence of SARS-Cov-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs, but it can have a poor sensitivity. A rapid, host-based physiological test that indicated whether the individual was infected or not would be highly desirable. Coagulaopathies are a common accompaniment to COVID-19, especially micro-clots within the lungs. We show here that microclots can be detected in the native plasma of COVID-19 patient, and in particular that such clots are amyloid in nature as judged by a standard fluorogenic stain. This provides a rapid and convenient test (P<0.0001), and suggests that the early detection and prevention of such clotting could have an important role in therapy.","Pretorius, E.; Venter, C.; Laubscher, G.

88,"Rapid, sensitive and specific SARS coronavirus-2 detection: a multi-center comparison between standard qRT-PCR and CRISPR based DETECTR.","Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics suggest that DETECTR, a combination of isothermal reverse transcriptase loop mediated amplification (RT-LAMP) and subsequent Cas12 bystander nuclease activation by amplicon targeting ribonucleoprotein complexes, could be a faster and cheaper alternative to qRT-PCR without sacrificing sensitivity/specificity. Here we compare qRT-PCR with DETECTR to diagnose COVID-19 on 378 patient samples and report a 95% reproducibility. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared to qRT-PCR, however, this was not confirmed in a large patient cohort. The data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting SARS-CoV-2 providing an added value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different gRNAs can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point of care test (POCT), showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. Importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 and did not detect other human coronaviruses. As there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR-platforms for routine non- SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","Brandsma, E.; Verhagen, H.

To aid these efforts, we developed the Mobility-Augmented SEIR model (mbox{MA-SEIR}) that leverages Google's aggregate and anonymized mobility data to augment classic compartmental models. We show in a retrospective analysis how this method can be applied at an early stage in the mbox{COVID-19} epidemic to forecast its subsequent spread and onset in different geographic regions, with minimal parameterization of the model. This provides insight into the role of near real-time aggregate mobility data in disease spread modeling by quantifying substantial changes in how populations move both locally and globally.

92,The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health outcomes among hospital fever clinic attendants across Nepal: A community-based cross-sectional study,"Background: The COVID 19 pandemic has been creating a panic and distressing situations among the entire population globally including Nepal. No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID 19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID 19 symptoms. Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted between May to June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. Results: The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. Participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.42 10.59), while stress (OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.09 21.29) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.10 10.35) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.21 8.20) and depression (2.75, 95% CI 1.16 6.51) than men. Similarly, people with primary level education found more prone to all factors, stress (OR 20.35, 95% CI 2.06 201.19), anxiety (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.24 7.91), and depression (OR 4.41, 95% CI 1.29 15.07). More farmers than labors showed higher odds (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.01 5.01) for anxiety, while individuals surveyed who reported their health status as poor-had higher odds (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.08 32.68) for depression. Also, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.07 9.05) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.01 12.58). Conclusion: The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID 19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID 19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.

Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94%.

94,Age-severity matched cytokine profiling reveals specific signatures in Covid-19 patients,"A global effort is currently undertaken to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Host immunity has come out as a determinant for COVID-19 clinical outcome, and several studies investigated the immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected people to properly direct the clinical management of the disease. Thus, lymphopenia, T-cell exhaustion, and the increased levels of inflammatory mediators have been described in COVID-19 patients, in particular in severe cases1. Age represents a key factor in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2. Understanding age-associated immune signatures of patients is therefore important to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the immune profile of COVID-19 hospitalized patients identifying a distinctive age-dependent immune signature associated with disease severity. Indeed, defined circulating factors - CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27 and TNF- - positively correlate with older age, longer hospitalization, and a more severe form of the disease and may thus represent the leading signature in critical COVID-19 patients.","Angioni, R.; Sanchez-Rodriguez, R.; Munari, F.; Bertoldi, N.; Arcidiacono, D.; Cavinato, S.; Marturano, D.; Cattelan, A.; Viola, A.; Molon, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20162735v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20162735v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

CardioVascular Outcomes Trials (CVOTs) conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic are available. We aimed to estimate the effect of DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infections. Methods We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, searching for CVOTs assessing a DPP4 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We focused on placebo-controlled CVOTs. Our primary outcome was 'any respiratory infection'. We added a sensitivity analysis integrating non-CVOTs and active-controlled CVOTs. Findings We included 47 714 patients in five placebo-controlled CVOTs. Median follow-up ranged from 1.5 years to 3 years. 4 369 events of overall respiratory infection were reported (rate of 9.2%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk compared to placebo (RR = 0.99 [95%CI: 0.93; 1.04]). The sensitivity analysis integrating the non-CVOTs studies and the active-controlled CVOT reached 11 349 events among 82 644 participants (rate of 13.7%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk of overall respiratory infection (RR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.97; 1.03]). Interpretation Our up-dated meta-analysis provides the most powerful and least biased estimation of the association of DPP4 inhibitors and the risk of overall (non COVID-19) respiratory infection. We did not find any effect of the DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infection. Our results support the recently published practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors should not be discontinued regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.","Grenet, G.; Mekhaldi, S.; MAINBOURG, S.; AUFFRET, M.; Cornu, C.; Cracowski, J.-L.; Gueyffier, F.; Lega, J.-C.; CUCHERAT, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163386v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.20163386v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. Design: An online cross-sectional survey conducted May 8 to May 11 2020. Participants: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by online panel provider. Main outcome measure: Proportion of participants with correct/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified washing your hands regularly with soap and water (92%) and staying at least 1.5m away from others (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that regular use of antibiotics would not prevent COVID-19. Most participants (90%) identified fever, fatigue and cough as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to hold your breath for 10 seconds without coughing was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%), and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). Conclusions: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appear to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long-term. Currently these non-drug interventions are our only effective strategy to combat this pandemic. Ensuring ongoing adherence to is critical.","Thomas, R.; Greenwood, H.; Michaleff, Z.

Longitudinal assessment of mental health during Covid-19 in a representative population-based sample, however, is currently largely missing. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms measured before and during Covid-19 pandemic in a representative population-based sample. Methods: Baseline data on stress levels and depressive symptoms from a well-established population-based sample were compared with those obtained from self-administered e-questionnaires distributed during Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 715 participants completed e-questionnaires. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test repeated-measure differences, while between-group differences were analysed using Mann-Whitney and the Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Perceived stress levels and depressive symptoms increased 1.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the time prior Covid-19. Changes in stress and depressive symptoms were most significant in females and did not depend on whether one quarantined alone or with others. Feeling of loneliness during Covid-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on increased stress levels and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This population-based longitudinal study showed that Covid-19 related measures had significant impact on mental health in a general population with the feeling of loneliness identified as the biggest risk factor.

Setting Level: This study utilizes data for 125 countries for contextual variables from 1st January 2020 until the 15th June 2020. Participants: This study considers deaths from covid-19. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The contextual variables considered in this study are stringency index, stringency variability, lockdown date, population density, level of airline passengers and country health security index. Results: It is shown there is a very strong association between the level of airline passengers and covid-19 deaths. The results from regression analysis conducted in this study show significant positive relationships at the 5% level of statistical significance between Deaths from covid-19 and airline passenger levels and stringency variability; significant negative relationships are revealed for stringency index and lockdown date supporting the notion that lock down and social distancing measures mattered and were effective. The Global health security index and population density did not significantly affect deaths. Conclusion: This study highlights the strong link between a country's airline passengers and covid-19 deaths and found that the lockdown date and stringency measures had a significant effect upon deaths. The implications of the research is that lockdown and stringency measures implemented by governments around the world worked and mattered. Further, the fact that global health security did not affect deaths may indicate better preparedness required to confront future pandemics.","HOOPER, V.

100,"Whence the next pandemic? The intersecting global geography of the animal-human interface, poor health systems and air transit centrality reveals conduits for high-impact spillover","The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.","Walsh, M.

101,Computer-aided medical microbiology monitoring tool: a strategy to adapt to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and that highlights RT-PCR consistency,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, important health and regulatory decisions relied on the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Our diagnostic laboratory faced a rapid increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, with up to 1,007 tests per day. To maintain a rapid turnaround time to support patient management and public health authorities' decisions, we moved from a case-by-case validation of RT-PCR to an automated validation and immediate transmission of the results to clinicians. To maintain high quality and to track possible aberrant results, we developed a quality-monitoring tool based on a homemade algorithm coded in R. We present the results of this quality-monitoring tool applied to 35,137 RT-PCR results corresponding to 30,198 patients. Patients tested several times led to 4,939 pairwise comparisons; 88% concordant and 12% discrepant. Among the 573 discrepancies, 428 were automatically solved by the algorithm. The most likely explanation for these 573 discrepancies was related for 44.9% of the situations to ""Clinical evolution"", 27.9% to ""Preanalytical"" problems, and 25.3% to ""Stochastic"". Finally, 11 discrepant results could not be explained, including 8 received from external partners for which clinical data were not available. The implemented quality-monitoring strategy allowed to: i) assist the investigation of discrepant results ii) focus the attention of medical microbiologists onto results requiring a specific expertise and iii) maintain an acceptable TAT.

103,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Kenyan blood donors,"Background There are no data on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Africa though the COVID-19 epidemic curve and reported mortality differ from patterns seen elsewhere. We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya. Methods We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG prevalence by ELISA on residual blood donor samples obtained between April 30 and June 16, 2020. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 83% (95% CI 59, 96%) and 99.0% (95% CI 98.1, 99.5%), respectively. National seroprevalence was estimated using Bayesian multilevel regression and post-stratification to account for non-random sampling with respect to age, sex and region, adjusted for assay performance. Results Complete data were available for 3098 of 3174 donors, aged 15-64 years. By comparison with the Kenyan population, the sample over-represented males (82% versus 49%), adults aged 25-34 years (40% versus 27%) and residents of coastal Counties (49% versus 9%). Crude overall seroprevalence was 5.6% (174/3098). Population-weighted, test-adjusted national seroprevalence was 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 7.1%). Seroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties; Mombasa (9.3% [95% CI 6.4, 13.2%)], Nairobi (8.5% [95% CI 4.9, 13.5%]) and Kisumu (6.5% [95% CI 3.3, 11.2%]). Conclusions We estimate that 1 in 20 adults in Kenya had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the study period. By the median date of our survey, only 2093 COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths had been reported through the national screening system. This contrasts, by several orders of magnitude, with the numbers of cases and deaths reported in parts of Europe and America when seroprevalence was similar.","Uyoga, S.; Adetifa, I. M.

104,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among health care workers in a secondary teaching hospital in Spain.,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a huge challenge to healthcare systems and their personnel worldwide. The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers, through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk. Methods and Findings. This is a cross-sectional and longitudinal study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, finally 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the OHS for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) has been 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p=0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p<0.01). Conclusions. Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%. Doctors and medical services personnel have had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of them have not presented compatible symptoms. This emphasizes the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel and not only based on the appearance of symptoms.","Garralda Fernandez, J.; Molero Vilches, I.; Bermejo Rodriguez, A.; Cano de Torres, I.; Colino Romay, E.

COVID-19 induced pneumonia in human hosts and carried a highly inter-person contagiousness. The COVID-19 patients may carry severe symptoms, and some of them may even die of major organ failures. This study utilized the machine learning algorithms to build the COVID-19 severeness detection model. Support vector machine (SVM) demonstrated a promising detection accuracy after 32 features were detected to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 severeness. These 32 features were further screened for inter-feature redundancies. The final SVM model was trained using 28 features and achieved the overall accuracy 0.8148. This work may facilitate the risk estimation of whether the COVID-19 patients would develop the severe symptoms. The 28 COVID-19 severeness associated biomarkers may also be investigated for their underlining mechanisms how they were involved in the COVID-19 infections.","Yao, H.; Zhang, N.; Zhang, R.; Duan, M.; Xie, T.; Pan, J.; Peng, E.; Huang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, X.; Xu, H.; Zhou, F.; Wang, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20044990v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20044990v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True
106,"An Analysis of Territorial Patterns in COVID-19 Mortality in France, Spain, Italy and the UK","This paper provides an overview of territorial patterns of COVID-19 deaths in four European countries severely affected by the pandemic, Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on cumulated COVID-19 mortality at the sub-regional level, following the territorial subdivision of countries adopted by the European Union. The paper builds upon a dataset with highly granular information on COVID-19 deaths assembled from various sources. The analysis shows remarkable differences in territorial patterns of COVID-19 mortality, both within and across the four countries reviewed. Results somewhat differ depending on the aspect considered (concentration of deaths or mortality rates) but, in general, Italy, France and Spain display significant territorial disparities, with selected sub-regions being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Instead, the picture is more uniform in the UK, with comparatively lower differences across the various sub-regions. These findings suggest that analyses of COVID-19 mortality at the national level (and, sometimes, even at the regional level) may conceal major differences and therefore be of limited use, both analytically and from an operational viewpoint.","Zavatta, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162677v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162677v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

108,Mathematical Modelling the Impact Evaluation ofLockdown on Infection Dynamics of COVID-19 inItaly.,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), within months of emergence from Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread, exacting a devastating human toll across around the world reaching the pandemic stage at the the beginning of March 2020. Thus, COVID-19s daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. Covid-19 epidemic in Italy started as a small wave of 2 infected cases on January 31. It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions reported in 6387 cases on March 8. It caused the government to impose a lockdown on 8 March to the whole country as a way to suppress the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the lockdown and awareness dynamics on infection in Italy over the period of January 31 to July 17 and how the impact varies across different lockdown scenarios in both periods before and after implementation of the lockdown policy. The findings SEIR reveal that implementation lockdown has minimised the social distancing flattening the curve. The infections associated with COVID-19 decreases with quarantine initially then easing lockdown will not cause further increasing transmission until a certain period which is explained by public high awareness. Completely removing lockdown may lead to sharp transmission second wave. Policy implementation and limitation of the study were evaluated at the end of the paper.

109,Persistent heterogeneity not short-term overdispersion determines herd immunity to COVID-19,"It has become increasingly clear that the COVID-19 epidemic is characterized by overdispersion whereby the majority of the transmission is driven by a minority of infected individuals. Such a strong departure from the homogeneity assumptions of traditional well-mixed compartment model is usually hypothesized to be the result of short-term super-spreader events, such as individual's extreme rate of virus shedding at the peak of infectivity while attending a large gathering without appropriate mitigation. However, heterogeneity can also arise through long-term, or persistent variations in individual susceptibility or infectivity. Here, we show how to incorporate persistent heterogeneity into a wide class of epidemiological models, and derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number R_e on the susceptible population fraction S. Persistent heterogeneity has three important consequences compared to the effects of overdispersion: (1) It results in a major modification of the early epidemic dynamics; (2) It significantly suppresses the herd immunity threshold; (3) It significantly reduces the final size of the epidemic. We estimate social and biological contributions to persistent heterogeneity using data on real-life face-to-face contact networks and age variation of the incidence rate during the COVID-19 epidemic, and show that empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic in New York City (NYC) and Chicago and all 50 US states provide a consistent characterization of the level of persistent heterogeneity. Our estimates suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, are close to the persistent heterogeneity herd immunity threshold following the first wave of the epidemic, thereby limiting the spread of infection to other regions during a potential second wave of the epidemic. Our work implies that general considerations of persistent heterogeneity in addition to overdispersion act to limit the scale of pandemics.","Tkachenko, A.

110,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Short-term Course of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"Background: There is an understandable concern that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is little empirical data. We report the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term course of OCD. We also assessed for predictors of relapse and emergence of COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Methods: A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n=240) who were on regular follow-up at a tertiary care specialty OCD Clinic in India were assessed telephonically, about 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic ('pandemic' cohort). Data from the medical records of an independent set of patients with OCD (n=207) who were followed-up during the same period, one year prior, was used for comparison (historical controls). Results: The 'pandemic' group and historical controls did not differ in the trajectories of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores (Chi-square for likelihood-ratio test of the Group x Time interaction = 2.73, p= 0.255) and relapse rate [21% vs 20%, adjusted odds ratio = 0.81 (95% CI 0.41 -1.59, p=0.535]. Pre-existing contamination symptoms and COVID-19-related health anxiety measured by the COVID-Threat Scale did not predict relapse. Only a small proportion of patients (6%) reported COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Limitations: Follow-up 2 months after pandemic declaration may be too early understand the true impact. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short-run, did not influence the course of illness in those who were on medications. It would be pertinent to evaluate the long-term impact of the pandemic on the course of OCD.","Sharma, L.

111,Association of D-dimer and fibrinogen magnitude with hypercoagulability by thromboelastography in severe COVID-19,"Introduction: D-dimer concentration has been used to identify candidates for intensified anticoagulant treatment for both venous thromboembolism prevention and mitigation of the microthrombotic complications associated with COVID-19. Thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) has been validated as an indicator of hypercoagulability and MA [&ge;] 68 mm has been utilized as a marker of hypercoagulability in other conditions. We evaluated the relationship between coagulation, inflammatory, and TEG parameters in patients with COVID-19 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: We performed a single center retrospective analysis of consecutive patients that received ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. TEG, inflammatory, and coagulation markers were compared in patients with and without thrombotic complications. Correlation tests were performed to identify the coagulation and inflammatory markers that best predict hypercoagulability as defined by an elevated TEG MA. Results: 168 TEGs were available in 24 patients. C-reactive protein and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients that developed a thrombotic event versus those that did not (p=0.038 and p=0.043 respectively). D-dimer was negatively correlated with TEG MA (p<0.001) while fibrinogen was positively correlated (p<0.001). A fibrinogen > 441 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 85.7% for the detection of MA [&ge;] 68 mm. Conclusions: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, D-dimer concentration had an inverse relationship with hypercoagulability as measured by TEG MA. D-dimer elevation may reflect severity of COVID-19 related sepsis rather than designate patients likely to benefit from anticoagulation. Fibrinogen concentration may represent a more useful marker of hypercoagulability in this population.","Chandel, A.; Patolia, S.; Looby, M.; Dalton, H.; Bade, N.; Khangoora, V.; Desai, M.; Lantry, J.; Osborn, E.; Djurkovic, S.; Tang, D.; Nathan, S.

Using the the measured values of displacement of people mobilizing between each city, the pandemic network of all cities in France is simulated by using the same model and method as the pandemic network of regions. Finally, a discussion on an integro-differential equation is given and a new model for the network pandemic model of each age class is provided.","Guan, L.; Prieur, C.; Zhang, L.; Prieur, C.; Georges, D.; Bellemain, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20161430v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20161430v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

In this study, 450 MTurk workers completed measures of (a) risk for COVID-19, (b) perceived vulnerability to disease, (c) intolerance of uncertainty, (d) mindfulness, (e) COVID-19 preventive health behaviors, (f) post-Trauma symptoms, and (g) stress related physical symptoms. The surveys were completed between April 9, 2020 and April 18, 2020 which is a period that corresponded to the first 2-3 weeks of lockdown for most participants. A substantial number of participants reported a reduction employment status and 69% were in self-isolation. The participants reported a high degree of perceived vulnerability with 68% indicating they felt there was a 50/50 chance or greater they would contract COVID-19. Mask wearing was variable: 16% not at all, 20% some of the time, 42% a good part of the time, and 26% most of the time. Using clinical cutoff on the post-trauma scale, 70% of the sample would be considered to have symptoms consistent with PTSD. The mean level of physical symptoms was significantly (p < .001) and substantially higher (d = 1.46) than norms. PPE use was positively associated with level of education and mindfulness nonreactivity and negatively associated with age, having a current medical condition, and mindfulness nonjudgment. Post trauma and physical health symptoms were strongly predicted by susceptibility variables and intolerance of uncertainty.","OBrien, W. H.; Wang, S.; Varga, A. V.; Xu, H.; Sims, T. E.; Horan, K.

118,"Contact tracing during Phase I of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Province of Trento, Italy: key findings and recommendations","Introduction Contact tracing is a key pillar of COVID-19 control. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy) a software was developed to standardize data collection and facilitate surveillance of contacts and outbreaks and map the links between bases and contacts. In this paper, we present the results of contact tracing efforts during Phase I of the epidemic (March-April, 2020, mostly under lockdown), including sociodemographic characteristics of contacts who became cases and of the cases who infected one or more contact. Methods A contact tracing website was developed that included components for geolocation and linking of cases and contacts using open source software. Information on community-based confirmed and probable cases and their contacts was centralized on the website. Information on cases came directly from the central case database, information on contacts was collected by telephone interviews following a standard questionnaire. Contacts were followed via telephone, emails, or an app. Results The 2,812 laboratory-diagnosed community cases of COVID-19 had 6,690 community contacts, of whom 890 (13.3%) developed symptoms. Risk of developing symptomatic disease increased with age and was higher in workplace contacts than cohabitants or non-cohabiting family or friends. The greatest risk of transmission to contacts was found for the 14 cases <15 years of age (22.4%); 8 of the 14, who ranged in age from <1 to 11 years) infected 11 of 49 contacts. Overall, 606 outbreaks were identified, 74% of which consisted of only two cases. Discussion The open-source software program permitted the centralized tracking of contacts and rapid identification of links between cases. Workplace contacts were at higher risk of developing symptoms. Although childhood contacts were less likely to become cases, children were more likely to infect household members, perhaps because of the difficulty of successfully isolating children in household settings.","Fateh-Moghadam, P.; Battisti, L.; Molinaro, S.; Fontanari, S.; Dallago, G.; Binkin, N.; Zuccali, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20127357v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20127357v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True

120,Children with COVID-19 like symptoms in Italian Pediatric Surgeries: the dark side of the coin,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are nonspecific and shared with other common acute viral illnesses (fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, and cutaneous signs), thus making clinical differential diagnosis tricky. In Italy, first line management of pediatric care is handed over to Primary Care Pediatricians (PCPs), who were not allowed to directly perform diagnostic tests during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Without a confirmatory diagnosis, PCPs could only collect information on ''COVID-19 like symptoms'' rather than identify typical COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 like symptoms in outpatient children, during Italian lockdown. To provide PCPs a risk score to be used in clinical practice during the differential diagnosis process. METHODS: A survey was submitted to 50 PCPs (assisting 47,500 children) from 7 different Italian regions between the 4th of March and the 23rd of May 2020 (total and partial lockdown period). COVID-19 like symptoms in the assisted children were recorded, as well as presence of confirmed/suspected cases in children's families, which was taken as proxy of COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression was accomplished to estimate the risk of having suspected/confirmed cases in families, considering symptoms as potential determinants. RESULTS: 2,300 children (4.8% of overall survey population) fell ill with COVID-19 like symptoms, 3.1% and 1.7% during total and partial lockdown period respectively. The concurrent presence of fatigue, cough, and diarrhea in children, in absence of sore throat/earache and abnormal skin signs, represents the maximum risk level of having a suspected/confirmed case of COVID-19 at home. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of children presenting COVID-19 like symptoms at home has been remarkable also during the total lockdown period. The present study identified a pattern of symptoms which could help, in a cost-effective perspective, PCPs in daily clinical practice to define priorities in addressing children to the proper diagnostic procedure.","Trapani, G.; Fanos, V.; Bertino, E.; Maiocco, G.; Al Jamal, O.; Fiore, M.; Bembo, V.; Careddu, D.; Barberio, L.; Zanino, L.; Verlato, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20149757v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20149757v1?rss=1,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,,True
121,SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro neutralization assay reveals inhibition of virus entry by iota-carrageenan,"In the absence of a vaccine and other effective prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a significant public health threat. Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus (SSPL) was developed that allows studying spike-mediated cell entry via luciferase reporter activity in a BSL2 environment. Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of SSPL in a dose dependent manner. SSPL particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 {micro}g/ml iota-carrageenan. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction in severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SSPL suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Morokutti-Kurz, M.; Graf, P.; Grassauer, A.; Prieschl-Grassauer, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.224733v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.224733v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,False
122,A Speedy Route to Multiple Highly Potent SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors,"The COVID-19 pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, requires its main protease (SC2MPro) to digest two of its translated polypeptides to form a number of mature proteins that are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replication in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1MPro), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain {beta}-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with IC50 values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound MPI3 has as an IC50 value as 8.5 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to 7 inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549 cells. Two inhibitors MP5 and MPI8 completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5 M and A549 cells at 0.16-0.31 M. Their virus inhibition potency is much higher than some existing molecules that are under preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study indicates that there is a large chemical space that needs to be explored for the development of SC2MPro inhibitors with extreme potency. Due to the urgent matter of the COVID-19 pandemic, MPI5 and MPI8 may be quickly advanced to preclinical and clinical tests for COVID-19.","Liu, W. R.; Yang, K. S.; Ma, X. R.; Ma, Y.; Alugubelli, Y.

123,Pyronaridine and artesunate are potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19 and influenza,"Since the first human case was reported in Wuhan Province, China in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of human infections in more than 200 countries worldwide with an approximately 4.01% case-fatality rate (as of 27 July, 2020; based on a WHO situation report), and COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed our global community. Even though a few candidate drugs, such as remdesivir (a broad antiviral prodrug) and hydroxychloroquine, have been investigated in human clinical trials, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be clarified further to be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we show that pyronaridine and artesunate, which are the chemical components of anti-malarial drug Pyramax(R), exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. In human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells, pyronaridine and artesunate were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 while hydroxychloroquine did not show any effect at concentrations of less than 100 M. In viral growth kinetics, both pyronaridine and artesunate inhibited the growth of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells. Taken together, we suggest that artesunate and pyronaridine might be effective drug candidates for use in human patients with COVID-19 and/or influenza, which may co-circulate during this coming winter season.","Bae, J.-Y.; Lee, G.

While SARS-CoV-2, the causal pathogen of COVID-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain cells and impact their function are not well understood, and experimental models using human brain cells are urgently needed. Here we investigated the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived monolayer brain cells and region-specific brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found modest numbers of infected neurons and astrocytes, but greater infection of choroid plexus epithelial cells. We optimized a protocol to generate choroid plexus organoids from hiPSCs, which revealed productive SARS-CoV-2 infection that leads to increased cell death and transcriptional dysregulation indicative of an inflammatory response and cellular function deficits. Together, our results provide evidence for SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and support use of hiPSC-derived brain organoids as a platform to investigate the cellular susceptibility, disease mechanisms, and treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jacob, F.; Pather, S.; Huang, W.-K.; Wong, S.

Numerous unique scFv clones capable of inhibiting binding of the viral S1 ectodomain to the ACE2 receptor in vitro were characterized. To maximize avidity, selected clones were reformatted as bivalent diabodies and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The highest affinity mAb completely neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell culture for four days at a concentration of 6.7 nM, suggesting potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic use. Furthermore, scFvs were identified that greatly increased the interaction of the viral S1 trimer with the ACE2 receptor, with potential implications for vaccine development.","Beasley, M.

126,Comparative Analysis of Human Coronaviruses Focusing on Nucleotide Variability and Synonymous Codon Usage Pattern,"Prevailing pandemic across the world due to SARSCoV-2 drawing great attention towards discovering its evolutionary origin. We perform an exploratory study to understand the variability of the whole coding region of possible proximal evolutionary neighbours of SARSCoV-2. We consider seven (07) human coronavirus strains from six different species as a candidate for our study.

First, we observe a good variability of nucleotides across candidate strains. We did not find a significant variation of GC content across the strains for codon position first and second. However, we interestingly see huge variability of GC-content in codon position 3rd (GC3), and pairwise mean GC-content (SARSCoV, MERSCoV), and (SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E) are quite closer. While observing the relative abundance of dinucleotide feature, we find a shared typical genetic pattern, i.e., high usage of GC and CT nucleotide pair at the first two positions (P12) of codons and the last two positions (P23) of codons, respectively. We also observe a low abundance of CG pair that might help in their evolution bio-process. Secondly, Considering RSCU score, we find a substantial similarity for mild class coronaviruses, i.e., hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 based on their codon hit with high RSCU value ([&ge;] 1.5), and minim number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. We see seven codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT, GTT, GCT and GGT with high RSCU value, which are common in all seven strains. These codons are mostly from Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature reveals proximity among hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E (mild). Thirdly, we perform linear regression analysis among GC content in different codon position and ENC value. We observe a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV. We believe that our findings will help in understanding the mechanism of human coronavirus.","Das, J.; Roy, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.224386v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.28.224386v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,False
127,The mutational analysis unveils the distribution of G614 genotype of SARS-CoV-2in different Indian states and its association with case fatality rate of COVID-19,"Pan genomic analysis of the global SARS-CoV-2 isolates has resulted in the identification of several regions of increased genetic variation but there is absence of research on its association with the clinical outcome. The present study fills the vacuum and does mutational analysis of genomic sequence of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Results reveal the existence of non-synonymous G614 spike protein mutation in 61.45% of the total study genome along with three other mutations. Further, temporal variation in the frequencies of G614 genotype in the country is observed. The examination of the probable association of G614 genotype with COVID-19 severity shows that CFR G614 genotype in India is positively and strongly correlated. It appears that the clinical outcome of the COVID-19 cases in India are significantly and adversely affected by the increasing trend in the G614 genotype; which needs to be addressed combining both laboratory experiments and epidemiological investigations.","Kumar, B.

128,Rapid host response to an infection with Coronavirus. Study of transcriptional responses with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus,"The transcriptional response in Vero cells (ATCC(R) CCL-81) infected with the coronavirus Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) was measured by RNAseq analysis 4 and 6 hours after infection. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) in PEDV infected cells were compared to DEGs responding in Vero cells infected with Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV). Functional analysis of MRV and PEDV DEGs showed that MRV increased the expression level of several cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL6, CXCL10, IL1A, CXCL8 [alias IL8]) and antiviral genes (e.g. IFI44, IFIT1, MX1, OASL), whereas for PEDV no enhanced expression was observed for these ""hallmark"" antiviral and immune effector genes. Pathway and Gene Ontology ""enrichment analysis"" revealed that PEDV infection did not stimulate expression of genes able to activate an acquired immune response, whereas MRV did so within 6h. Instead, PEDV down-regulated the expression of a set of zinc finger proteins with putative antiviral activity and enhanced the expression of the transmembrane serine protease gene TMPRSS13 (alias MSPL) to support its own infection by virus-cell membrane fusion (Shi et al, 2017, Viruses, 9(5):114). PEDV also down-regulated expression of Ectodysplasin A, a cytokine of the TNF-family able to activate the canonical NFKB-pathway responsible for transcription of inflammatory genes like IL1B, TNF, CXCL8 and PTGS2. The only 2 cytokine genes found up-regulated by PEDV were Cardiotrophin-1, an IL6-type cytokine with pleiotropic functions on different tissues and types of cells, and Endothelin 2, a neuroactive peptide with vasoconstrictive properties. Furthermore, by comprehensive datamining in biological and chemical databases and consulting related literature we identified sets of PEDV-response genes with potential to influence i) the metabolism of biogenic amines (e.g. histamine), ii) the formation of cilia and ""synaptic clefts"" between cells, iii) epithelial mucus production, iv) platelets activation, and v) physiological processes in the body regulated by androgenic hormones (like blood pressure, salt/water balance and energy homeostasis). The information in this study describing a ""very early"" response of epithelial cells to an infection with a coronavirus may provide pharmacologists, immunological and medical specialists additional insights in the underlying mechanisms of coronavirus associated severe clinical symptoms including those induced by SARS-CoV-2.

130,30-day mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 versus influenza: A populationbased study,"Background As of July 2020, COVID-19 has caused 500,000 deaths worldwide. However, large-scale studies of COVID-19 mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to influenza and individuals tested negative for COVID-19 are lacking. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 30-day mortality and newonset comorbidity compared to individuals with negative COVID-19 test results and individuals tested for influenza. Methods and findings This population-based cohort study utilized electronic health records covering roughly half (n=2,647,229) of Denmark's population, with nationwide linkage of microbiology test results and death records. All individuals [&ge;]18 years tested for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza were followed from November 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020. The main outcome was 30-day mortality after a test for either COVID-19 or influenza. Secondary outcomes were major comorbidity diagnoses 30-days after the test for either COVID-19 or influenza. In total, 224,639 individuals were tested for COVID-19. Among inpatients positive for COVID-19, 356 of 1657 (21%) died within 30 days, which was a 3.0 to 3.1-fold increased 30-day mortality rate, when compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative inpatients (all p<0.001). For outpatients, 128 of 6,263 (2%) COVID-19-positive patients died within 30 days, which was a 5.5 to 6.9-fold increased mortality rate compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative patients, respectively (all p<0.001). Compared to hospitalized patients with influenza, new-onset ischemic stroke, diabetes and nephropathy occurred more frequently in inpatients with COVID-19 (all p<0.05). Conclusions In this population-based study comparing COVID-19 with influenza, COVID-19 was associated with increased rates of major systemic and vascular comorbidity and substantially higher mortality, which is likely even higher than the stated 3.0 to 5.5-fold increase owing to more extensive testing for COVID-19.","Nersesjan, V.; Amiri, M.; Christensen, H.

131,"Levels of the TNF related cytokine, LIGHT increase in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with Cytokine Release Syndrome and ARDS","Many COVID-19 patients demonstrate lethal respiratory complications caused by cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Multiple cytokines have been implicated in CRS, but TNFSF14 (LIGHT) has not been previously measured in this setting. In this study, we observed significantly elevated serum LIGHT levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy age and gender matched control patients. The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (p=0.0209) in those who died compared to survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients with significantly (p=0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died vs. survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited effect in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses.","Perlin, D.

133,Effectiveness and Safety of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine as a mono-therapy or in combination with Azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Many recent studies have investigated the role of either Chloroquine (CQ) alone, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or CQ/HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM) in management of the emerging coronavirus. This systematic review and meta-analysis of either published or preprint observational or interventional studies were conducted to assess the cure rate, duration of hospital stay, radiological progression, clinical worsening, need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of side effects, and mortality. A search of the online database through June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean, of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the random-effects model. Results: The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the standard care in comparison with HCQ group, the standard mean of hospital stay was 0.57, 95% CI, and 0.20-0.94. Overall virological cure, or more specifically at day 4, 10, and 14 among patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the standard care [(RR=0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.15), (RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65), (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.70-2.01), and (RR=0.98, 95% CI, 0.76-1.27)] respectively. Radiological improvement or clinical worsening was not statistically different between HCQ and standard care [(RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.65) and (RR=1.28, 95% CI 0.33-4.99)]. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was not significant between the HCQ group and the standard care (RR= 1.5, 95%CI 0.78-2.89). Side effects were more reported in the HCQ group than the standard care (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58- 6.24). Mortality among HCQ was not affected by receiving HCQ (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24), meta-regression analysis revealed that country is a strong predictor of mortality. The duration of hospital stay among the HCQ and AZM didn not differ significantly from the standard care (standard mean= 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.08). Despite virological cure and need for MV did not differ significantly [(RR= 3.23, 95% CI 0.70-14.97) and (RR=1.27, 95%CI 0.7-2.13)] respectively. Mortality among the HCQ+AZM was more significantly higher than among the standard care (RR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.19-2.27). Conclusion: Despite the scarcity of published data of good quality, the effectiveness and safety of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZM in treating the pandemic of COVID-19 cannot be assured. Future randomized control trials need to be carried out to verify this conclusion.","Ghazy, R. M.; Almaghraby, A.; Shaaban, R.; Kamal, A.; Beshir, H.; Moursi, A.; Taha, S. H.

134,AutoSEIR: Accurate Forecasting from Real-time Epidemic Data Using Machine Learning,"Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak has been recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, several models have been proposed to forecast its evolution following the governments' interventions. In particular, the need for fine-grained predictions, based on real-time and fluctuating data, has highlighted the limitations of traditional SEIR models and parameter fitting, encouraging the study of new models for greater accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel approach to epidemiological parameter fitting and epidemic forecasting, based on an extended version of the SEIR compartmental model and on an auto-differentiation technique for partially observable ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations). The results on publicly available data show that the proposed model is able to fit the daily cases curve with greater accuracy, obtaining also a lower forecast error. Furthermore, the forecast accuracy allows to predict the peak with an error margin of less than one week, up to 50 days before the peak happens.","Rizzo, S.

135,"Modeling Control, Lockdown & Exit Strategies for COVID-19 Pandemic in India","COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global pandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths across the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix representing contact structures among different age groups of the population. Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020, for the purpose of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.","Barman, M.; Nayak, S.; Yadav, M.

136,The performance of Mobile Cabin Hospital in combatting COVID-19 in China,"Background: Since the end of 2019 to the present day, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an immense impact on China and on other countries worldwide. This outbreak represents a serious threat to the lives and health of people all around the world. The epidemic first broke out in Wuhan, where the Chinese government was unable to prevent the spread of the disease by implementing home quarantine measures. Mobile cabin hospitals were used to relieve pressure on hospitals due to the need for beds while also isolating the sources of the infection through a centralized quarantine and treatment of mild cases. Method: This paper reviewed and summarized the treatment of patients with mild illness and symptoms during the period from the construction to the closing of the Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital in Wuhan, China, and presented the operational elements and possible improvements of running this hospital. Results: Mobile cabin hospitals helped China to curb the epidemic in only 2 incubation periods in 28 days.The basic conditions required for a normal operation of mobile cabin hospitals included the selection of the environment, medical staff to patient ratio, organizational structure, management model, admission criteria, treatment approaches, discharge process, livelihood guarantee, security, and other safeguarding measures. All of these components were performed carefully in Wuhan Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital, without medical staff being infected. Conclusion: The mobile cabin hospital compulsory quarantine for mild patients was an alternative method to combat COVID-19. It is hoped that the presented work in this manuscript can serve as a reference for the emergency prevention and control measures for global epidemic outbreaks.","Li, H.; Lin, J.; Lian, H.; Chen, K.; Lyu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Ren, L.; Zheng, L.; Lin, Z.; Yu, X.; Chen, Z.; Rensing, C.; Qian, X.; Yang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162206v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162206v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,True
137,"Magnitude, demographics and dynamics of the impact of the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality in 17 industrialised countries","The Covid-19 pandemic affects mortality directly through infection as well as through changes in the social, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. The impacts on mortality are likely to vary across countries in magnitude, timing, and age and sex composition. Here, we applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data, by age group and sex, to consistently and comparably estimate the impacts of the first phase of the pandemic on all-cause mortality for 17 industrialised countries. The models accounted for factors that affect death rates including seasonality, temperature, and public holidays, as well as for medium-long-term secular trends and the dependency of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s). From mid-February through the end of May 2020, an estimated 202,900 (95% credible interval 179,400-224,900) more people died in these 17 countries than would have had the pandemic not taken place. Nearly three quarters of these excess deaths occurred in England and Wales, Italy and Spain, where less than half of the total population of these countries live. When all-cause mortality is considered, the total number of deaths, deaths per 100,000 people, and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. Further, in many countries, the balance of excess deaths changed from male-dominated early in the pandemic to being equal or female-dominated later on. Taken over the entire first phase of the pandemic, there was no detectable rise in all-cause mortality in New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland and for women in Austria and Switzerland (posterior probability of an increase in deaths <90%). Women in Portugal and men in Austria experienced relatively small increases in all-cause mortality, with posterior probabilities of 90-99%. For men in Switzerland and Portugal, and both sexes in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and England and Wales, all-cause mortality increased as a result of the pandemic with a posterior probability >99%. After accounting for population size, England and Wales and Spain experienced the highest death toll, nearly 100 deaths per 100,000 people; they also had the largest relative (percent) increase in deaths (37% (95% credible interval 30-44) in England and Wales; 38% (31-44) in Spain). New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced changes in deaths that ranged from possible slight declines to increases of no more than 5%. The large impact in England and Wales stems partly from having experienced (together with Spain) the highest weekly increases in deaths, more than doubling in some weeks, and having had (together with Sweden) the longest duration when deaths exceeded levels that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. The heterogeneous magnitude and character of the excess deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic (e.g., timing, extent and adherence to lockdowns and other social distancing measures; effectiveness of test, trace and isolate mechanisms), and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system (e.g., effective facility and community care pathways; minimising spread of infection within hospitals and care homes, and between them and the community).","Kontis, V.; Bennett, J.

138,"SARS-CoV-2 viral load dynamics, duration of viral shedding and infectiousness: a living systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Viral load kinetics and the duration of viral shedding are important determinants for disease transmission. We aim i) to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA, and viable virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in various body fluids and ii) to compare SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Europe PMC, preprint servers and grey literature were searched to retrieve all articles reporting viral dynamics and duration of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV shedding. We excluded case reports and case series with < 5 patients, or studies that did not report shedding duration from symptom onset. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181914. Findings: Seventy-nine studies on SARS-CoV-2, 8 on SARS-CoV-1, and 11 on MERS-CoV were included. Mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration in upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, stool and serum were 17.0, 14.6, 17.2 and 16.6 days, respectively. Maximum duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding reported in URT, LRT, stool and serum was 83, 59, 35 and 60 days, respectively. Pooled mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was positively associated with age (p=0.002), but not gender (p = 0.277). No study to date has detected live virus beyond day nine of illness despite persistently high viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appears to peak in the first week of illness, while SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV peak later. Conclusion: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. Thus, detection of viral RNA cannot be used to infer infectiousness. High SARS-CoV-2 titres are detectable in the first week of illness with an early peak observed at symptom onset to day 5 of illness. This review underscores the importance of early case finding and isolation, as well as public education on the spectrum of illness. However, given potential delays in the isolation of patients, effective containment of SARS-CoV-2 may be challenging even with an early detection and isolation strategy.

139,Does sampling saliva increase detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR? Comparing saliva with oro-nasopharyngeal swabs,"The gold standard method in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal sample by RT-PCR. Recently, saliva samples has been suggested as an alternative due to being fast, reliable and non-invasive, rather than nasopharyngeal samples. We compared RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients. 98 of 200 patients were positive in RT-PCR analysis performed before the hospitalization. In day 0, at least one sample was positive in 67% of 98 patients. Positivity rate was 83% for both oro-nasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 63% for saliva samples (p<0.001). On day 5, RT-PCR was performed in 59 patients, 34% had at least one positive result. The positivity rate was 55% for saliva and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 60% for oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Our study shows that the sampling saliva does not increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests at early stages of infection. However, on 5th day, viral RNA detection rates in saliva were similar to nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. In conclusion, we suggest that, in patients receiving treatment, virus presence in saliva, in addition to the standard samples, is important to determine the isolation period and to control the transmission.","Akgun Dogan, O.; Kose, B.; Agaoglu, N.

140,Impact of climatic parameters on COVID-19 pandemic progression in India: analysis and prediction,"COVID-19 is spreading rapidly worldwide and various factors of it have to be analysed. We analyze the effect of climatic parameters (Average Temperature (AT), Atmospheric Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Solar Radiation (SR) and Wind Speed (WS)) on the COVID-19 epidemic during 25 March 2020 to 15 June 2020 in most affected states of India i.e. Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamilnadu. We quantitatively establish the correlation between these parameters by using Kendall & Spearman rank correlation test. The results indicate that the positive cases are highly correlated with the AT (r^2 >0.6,p<0.001) in Delhi where as a moderate correlation ( r^2<0.6,p<0.001) has been estimated for Maharashtra and Tamilnadu. Similarly, an intermediate range of correlation coefficient has been observed for other climatic parameters. The range of climatic parameters have been found corresponding to maximum number of cases results as AT (25~40 0 C), RH (40~70%), AT (740~965 mmHg), SR (200-250 W/mt2) and WS (.5~14 m/sec). Time series analysis depicts that the positive cases and mortality are increasing rapidly.

141,Association of olfactory dysfunction with hospitalization for COVID-19: a multicenter study in Kurdistan,"Objective: To evaluate the association of olfactory dysfunction (OD) with hospitalization for COVID-19. Study Design: Multi-center cohort study. Setting: Emergency departments of thirteen COVID-19-designed hospitals in Kurdistan province, Iran. Subjects and Methods: Patients presenting with flu-like symptoms who tested positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19 between May 1st and 31st, 2020. At the time of presentation and enrollment, patients were asked about the presence of OD, fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, rhinorrhea and sore throat. The severity of OD was assessed on an 11-point scale from 0 (none) to 10 (anosmia). Patients were either hospitalized or sent home for outpatient care based on standardized criteria. Results: Of 203 patients, who presented at a mean of 6 days into the COVID-19 disease course, 25 patients (12.3%) had new OD and 138 patients (68.0%) were admitted for their COVID-19. Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p<0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0% sensitivity and 34.3% specificity. On univariate logistic regression, hospitalization was associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.085-6.911, p=0.049). However, hospitalization for COVID-19 was not associated with OD (OR=3.22, 95% CI: 0.57-18.31, p=0.188) after controlling for confounding demographics and comorbidities. Conclusion: OD may be associated with hospitalization for (and therefore more severe) COVID-19. However, this association between OD and COVID-19 severity is more likely driven by patient characteristics linked to OD, such as greater numbers of COVID-19 symptoms experienced or high-risk comorbidities.","Zobairy, H.; Shamsoddin, E.; Rasouli, M.

However, in our post-COVID-19 follow up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to an axonal mononeuritis multiplex. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such neuropathies. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to simply relate to ""critical illness neuropathy"". While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are common and frequently disabling in patients recovering from COVID-19.","Needham, E.; Newcombe, V.; Michell, A.; Thornton, R.; Grainger, A.; Anwar, F.; Warburton, E.; Menon, D.; Trivedi, M.; Sawcer, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20149898v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20149898v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,True

We hypothesized the application of pleiotropic tetracyclines as potential therapeutic candidates. Here, we present a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study evaluating ventilatory status in patients who had taken a tetracycline antibiotic within a year prior to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The primary outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Data was evaluated using logistic regression and treatment effects regression models. Minocycline or doxycycline treatment within a year prior to ARDS diagnosis was associated with a 75% reduced likelihood for mechanical ventilation during hospital stay. Furthermore, tetracycline antibiotic therapy corresponded to significant reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in ARDS patients. These data suggest tetracyclines may provide prophylactic benefit in reducing ventilatory support for ARDS patients and support further evaluation in a randomized prospective trial.","Byrne, J.

144,A Bayesian Framework for Estimating the Risk Ratio of Hospitalization for People with Comorbidity Infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Virus,"Estimating the hospitalization risk for people with certain comorbidities infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is important for developing public health policies and guidance based on risk stratification. Traditional biostatistical methods require knowing both the number of infected people who were hospitalized and the number of infected people who were not hospitalized. However, the latter may be undercounted, as it is limited to only those who were tested for viral infection. In addition, comorbidity information for people not hospitalized may not always be readily available for traditional biostatistical analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a Bayesian approach that only requires the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. By applying our approach to two different large-scale datasets in the U.S., our results consistently indicated that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity, respectively.","Gao, X.; Dong, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20162131v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20162131v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,True

The public reactions on Twitter about the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries have not been studied. This study aims to compare the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic between the United Kingdom and the United States from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Data: The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom and the United States were obtained from the 1Point3Acres website. Twitter data were collected using COVID-19 related keywords from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Methods: Temporal analyses were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter posts (tweets) during the study period to show daily trends and hourly trends. The sentiment scores of the tweets on COVID-19 were analyzed and associated with the policy announcements and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Topic modeling was conducted to identify related topics discussed with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the United States. Results: The number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom was significantly lower than that in the United States during our study period. There were 3,556,442 COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom and 16,280,065 tweets in the United States during the study period. The number of COVID-19 tweets per 10,000 Twitter users in the United Kingdom was lower than that in the United States. The sentiment scores of COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were less negative than those in the United States.

146,Changes in Cause-of-Death Attribution During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Association with Hospital Quality Metrics and Implications for Future Research,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is often comorbid with conditions subject to quality metrics (QM) used for hospital performance assessment and rate-setting. Although diagnostic coding change in response to financial incentives is well documented, no study has examined the association of QM with SARS-CoV-2 cause-of-death attribution (CODA). Calculations of excess all-cause deaths overlook the importance of accurate CODA and of distinguishing policy-related from virus-related mortality. Objective: Examine CODA, overall and for QM and non-QM diagnoses, in 3 pandemic periods: awareness (January 19-March 14), height (March 15-May 16), and late (May 17-June 20). Methods: Retrospective analysis of publicly available national weekly COD data, adjusted for population growth and reporting lags, October 2014-June 20, 2020. CODA in 5 pre-pandemic influenza seasons was compared with 2019-20. Suitability of the data to distinguish policy-related from virus-related effects was assessed. Results: Following federal guidance permitting SARS-CoV-2 CODA without laboratory testing, mortality from the QM diagnoses cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease declined steadily relative to prior-season means, reaching 4.4% less and 12.1% less, respectively, in late pandemic. Deaths for non-QM diagnoses increased, by 21.0% for Alzheimers disease and 29.0% for diabetes during pandemic height. Increases in competing CODs over historical experience, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 underreporting, more than offset declines during pandemic height. However, in the late-pandemic period, declines slightly numerically exceeded increases, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 overreporting. In pandemic-height and late-pandemic periods, respectively, only 83.5% and 69.7% of increases in all-cause deaths were explained by changes in the reported CODs, including SARS-CoV-2, preventing assessment of policy-related mortality or of factors contributing to increased all-cause deaths. Conclusions: Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 for competing CODs may have occurred, particularly for QM diagnoses and late in the pandemic. Continued monitoring of these trends, qualitative research on pandemic CODA, and the addition of place-of-death data and psychiatric CODs to the file would facilitate assessment of policy-related and virus-related effects on mortality.","Fairman, K.

147,Capping Mobility to Control COVID-19: A Collision-based Infectious Disease Transmission Model,"We developed a mobility-informed disease-transmission model for COVID-19, inspired by collision theory in gas-phase chemistry. This simple kinetic model leads to a closed-form infectious population as a function of time and cumulative mobility. This model uses fatality data from Johns Hopkins to infer the infectious population in the past, and mobility data from Google, without social-distancing policy, geological or demographic inputs. It was found that the model appears to be valid for twenty hardest hit counties in the United States. Based on this model, the number of infected people grows (shrinks) exponentially once the relative mobility exceeds (falls below) a critical value (~30% for New York City and ~60% for all other counties, relative to a median mobility from January 3 to February 6, 2020). A simple mobility cap can be used by government at different levels to control COVID-19 transmission in reopening or imposing another shutdown.","Shi, Y.; Ban, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20162016v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20162016v1?rss=1,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,,True

Social media is ablaze with discussions around the pandemic. There is the dire need to delineate the on-going conversations on the infection with the intention of creating awareness on peoples reaction, opinion, action and recommendation that are inimical to the well being of the populace. Hence, this study is geared towards performing thematic analysis of the discussions on social media about COVID19. We programmatically retrieved data from twitter between 1st March, 2020 to 30th June 2020 with covid19 related keywords. We processed the data and later categorized them into themes that evolved from the tweets namely Herbs and Vegetables as COVID-10 Panacea, Self-Medication Due to Prescription by Non-Medical Practitioners on Social Media, Conspiracy Theories on COVID19 and Fear and Anxiety Associated with COVID19. The results show that many are resulting to herbs to protect themselves against the disease; taking drugs without doctors prescription; believing in conspiracy theories and having certain degree of fear.","Afolabi, D.

149,Longitudinal COVID-19 Surveillance and Characterization in the Workplace with Public Health and Diagnostic Endpoints,"Background The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have precipitated a global pandemic heavily challenging our social behavior, economy, and healthcare infrastructure. Public health practices currently represent the primary interventions for managing the spread of the pandemic. We hypothesized that frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance would represent an effective approach to controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission among employees and their household members, reducing potential economic consequences and loss of productivity of standard isolation methods, while providing new insights into viral-host dynamics. Methodology and Findings On March 23, 2020 a clinical study (OCIS-05) was initiated at a small Southern California organization. Results from the first 3 months of the ongoing study are presented here. Study participants (27 employees and 27 household members) consented to provide frequent nasal or oral swab samples that were analyzed by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using CDC protocols. Only participants testing negative were allowed to enter the ""safe zone"" workplace facility. Optional blood samples were collected at baseline and throughout the 3-month study. Serum virus-specific antibody concentrations (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were measured using a selective, sensitive, and quantitative ELISA assay developed in house. A COVID-19 infection model, based on traditional SEIR compartmental models combined with Bayesian non-linear mixed models and modern machine learning, was used to predict the number of employees and household members who would have become infected in the absence of workplace surveillance. Two study participants were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the study. One subject, a household member, tested positive clinically by RT-qPCR prior to enrollment and experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms that did not require hospitalization. While on study, the participant was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for at least 71 days and had elevated virus-specific antibody concentrations (medians: IgM, 9.83 ug mL-1; IgG, 11.5 ug mL-1; IgA, 1.29 ug mL-1) in serum samples collected at three timepoints. A single, unrelated employee became positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study, but remained asymptomatic with low associated viral RNA copy numbers. The participant did not have detectable serum IgM and IgG concentrations, and IgA concentrations decayed rapidly (half-life: 1.3 d). The employee was not allowed entry to the safe zone workplace until testing negative three consecutive times over 7 d. No other employees or household members contracted COVID-19 over the course of the study. Our model predicted that under the current prevalence in Los Angeles County without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees (95% CI = 3-10) would have become infected with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalizations and 0 deaths. Conclusions Our clinical study met its primary objectives by using intense longitudinal testing to provide a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and elucidating SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in recovering and asymptomatic participants. The surveillance plan outlined here is scalable and transferrable. The study represents a powerful example on how an innovative public health initiative can be dovetailed with scientific discovery.","Gunawardana, M.; Breslin, J.; Cortez, J.

150,An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity eliminated neutralizing antibody with potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus monkeys,"Efficacious interventions are urgently needed for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody (mAb), MW05, showing high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity by disrupting the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Crosslinking of Fc with Fc{gamma}RIIB mediates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity by MW05. This activity was eliminated by introducing the LALA mutation to the Fc region (MW05/LALA). Most importantly, potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of MW05/LALA completely blocked the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a study of its prophylactic effect and totally cleared SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a treatment setting. These results pave the way for the development of MW05/LALA as an effective strategy for combating COVID-19.","Gui, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222257v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222257v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False
151,Structure and inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease reveals strategy for developing dual inhibitors against Mpro and cathepsin L,"The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a key antiviral drug target. While most SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have a {gamma}-lactam glutamine surrogate at the P1 position, we recently discovered several Mpro inhibitors have hydrophobic moieties at the P1 site, including calpain inhibitors II/XII, which are also active against human cathepsin L, a host-protease that is important for viral entry. To determine the binding mode of these calpain inhibitors and establish a structure-activity relationship, we solved X-ray crystal structures of Mpro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and XII, and three analogues of GC-376, one of the most potent Mpro inhibitors in vitro. The structure of Mpro with calpain inhibitor II confirmed the S1 pocket of Mpro can accommodate a hydrophobic methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue is necessary at this position. Interestingly, the structure of calpain inhibitor XII revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose where the P1 pyridine inserts in the S1 pocket and the P1 norvaline is positioned in the S1 pocket. The overall conformation is semi-helical, wrapping around the catalytic core, in contrast to the extended conformation of other peptidomimetic inhibitors. Additionally, the structures of three GC-376 analogues UAWJ246, UAWJ247, and UAWJ248 provide insight to the sidechain preference of the S1, S2, S3 and S4 pockets, and the superior cell-based activity of the aldehyde warhead compared with the -ketoamide. Taken together, the biochemical, computational, structural, and cellular data presented herein provide new directions for the development of Mpro inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.","Sacco, M.

153,An alternative binding mode of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain,"IGHV3-53-encoded neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Such IGHV3-53 antibodies generally have a short CDR H3 due to structural constraints in binding the RBD (mode A). However, a small subset of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the RBD contain a longer CDR H3. Crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies here demonstrate that a longer CDR H3 can be accommodated in a different binding mode (mode B). These two classes of IGHV3-53 antibodies both target the ACE2 receptor binding site, but with very different angles of approach and molecular interactions. Overall, these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition and virus neutralization.","Wu, N.

154,Predicting the Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Clades,"Evolution is a process of change where mutations in the viral RNA are selected based on their fitness for replication and survival. Given that current phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 identifies new viral clades after they exhibit evolutionary selections, one wonders whether we can identify the viral selection and predict the emergence of new viral clades? Inspired by the Kolmogorov complexity concept, we propose a generative complexity (algorithmic) framework capable to analyze the viral RNA sequences by mapping the multiscale nucleotide dependencies onto a state machine, where states represent subsequences of nucleotides and state-transition probabilities encode the higher order interactions between these states. We apply computational learning and classification techniques to identify the active state-transitions and use those as features in clade classifiers to decipher the transient mutations (still evolving within a clade) and stable mutations (typical to a clade). As opposed to current analysis tools that rely on the edit distance between sequences and require sequence alignment, our method is computationally local, does not require sequence alignment and is robust to random errors (substitution, insertions and deletions). Relying on the GISAID viral sequence database, we demonstrate that our method can predict clade emergence, potentially aiding with the design of medications and vaccines.","Jain, S.; Xiao, X.; Bogdan, P.; Bruck, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222117v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222117v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False

Patients on in-centre haemodialysis(HD) are particularly affected due to their multiple hospital visits and the need for uninterrupted care for their well-being and survival. We studied the impact of the pandemic and the national policy for pandemic control on the HD care delivery in Karnataka state in India in April 2020, when the first and second national lockdown were in place. An online, questionnaire based survey of dialysis facilities was conducted and the responses analysed. The questions were pertaining to the key areas such as changes in number of dialysis treatments, frequency, duration, expenses, transportation to and from dialysis units, impact on availability of consumables, effect on dialysis personnel and on machine maintenance. 62 centres participated. Median of dialysis treatments for the months of March and April 2020 were 695.5 and 650 respectively. Reduction in dialysis treatments was noted in 29(46.8%) facilities , decreased frequency reported by 60 centres. In at least 35(56.5%) centres, dialysis patients had to bear increased expenses.

156,Massive-scale biological activity-based modeling identifies novel antiviral leads against SARS-CoV-2,"The recent global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates. While the importance of traditional in silico approaches such as QSAR in such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from ~0.5 million compounds screened against ~2,000 assays. BABM models were then applied to predict ~300 compounds not previously reported to have activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (>30%) hit rates. The most potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery response in a global public health crisis.","Huang, R.; Xu, M.; Zhu, H.; Chen, C.

However, recent investigations based on metatranscriptomic samples of COVID-19 patients and SARS-COV-2 infected Vero cells have recovered contrasting findings. Using RNAseq data from time course experiments of infected human cell lines and transcriptome data from Vero cells and clinical samples, we prove that A-to-G changes observed in SARS-COV-2 genomes represent genuine RNA editing events, likely mediated by ADAR1. While the A-to-I editing rate is generally low, changes are distributed along the entire viral genome, are overrepresented in exonic regions and are, in the majority of cases, nonsynonymous.

We investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of this virus during the early outbreak months using whole genome sequences. We performed; recombination analysis against closely related CoV, Bayesian time scaled phylogeny and investigated spike protein amino acid mutations. Results from our analysis showed recombination signals between the AfrSARSCoV-2 sequences and reference sequences within the N and S genes. The evolutionary rate of the AfrSARSCoV-2 was 4.133 x 10-4 high posterior density HPD (4.132 x 10-4 to 4.134 x 10-4) substitutions/site/year. The time to most recent common ancestor TMRCA of the African strains was December 7th 2019. The AfrSARCoV-2 sequences diversified into two lineages A and B with B being more diverse with multiple sub-lineages confirmed by both maximum clade credibility MCC tree and PANGOLIN software. There was a high prevalence of the D614-G spike protein amino acid mutation (82.61%) among the African strains.

SEIHCRD model has seven compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), hospitalized (H), critical (C), recovered (R), and deceased or death (D), collectively termed SEIHCRD. We have studied COVID- 19 cases of six countries, where the impact of this disease in the highest are Brazil, India, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. SEIHCRD model is estimating COVID-19 spread and forecasting under uncertainties, constrained by various observed data in the present manuscript. We have first collected the data for a specific period, then fit the model for death cases, got the values of some parameters from it, and then estimate the basic reproduction number over time, which is nearly equal to real data, infection rate, and recovery rate of COVID-19. We also compute the case fatality rate over time of COVID-19 most affected countries. SEIHCRD model computes two types of Case fatality rate one is CFR daily and the second one is total CFR. We analyze the spread and endpoint of COVID-19 based on these estimates. SEIHCRD model is time-dependent hence we estimate the date and magnitude of peaks of corresponding to the number of exposed cases, infected cases, hospitalized cases, critical cases, and the number of deceased cases of COVID-19 over time.

160,Progenitor identification and SARS-CoV-2 infection in long-term human distal lung organoid cultures,"The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange and is affected by disorders including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pneumonia. Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 ""apical-out"" organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.","Salahudeen, A. A.; Choi, S.

Thus, they may degrade the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. EVs can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate conditions within them. MSC-EVs harbor major therapeutic miRNAs that play important roles in the biological functions of virus-infected host cells. Here, we examined their potential impact on viral and immune responses. MSC-EVs contained 18 miRNAs predicted to interact directly with the 3 UTR of SARS-CoV-2. These EVs suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. In addition, five major miRNAs suppressed virus activity in a luciferase reporter assay by binding the 3 UTR. MSC-EVs showed strong regenerative effects and potent anti-inflammatory activity which may prevent lethal cytokine storms. We confirmed that EVs regulated inflammatory responses by several cell types, including human brain cells that express the viral receptor ACE2, suggesting that the brain may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs in MSC-EVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2: 1) they bind specifically to the viral 3 UTR, and are thus unlikely to have side effects; 2) because the 3 UTR is highly conserved and rarely mutates, MSC-EV miRNAs could be used against novel variants arising during viral replication; and 3) unique cargoes carried by MSC-EVs can have diverse effects, such as regenerating damaged tissue and regulating immunity.","Moon, J.; Park, J.

162,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Membrane (M) Protein Inhibits Type I and III Interferon Production by Targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 Signaling,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly spread worldwide and has infected more than ten million individuals. One of the typical features of COVID-19 is that both type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity are suppressed. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades this antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. The SARS-CoV2 M protein also dampens type I and III IFN induction stimulated by Sendai virus infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1 and prevents the formation of a multi-protein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1, thus impeding IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation. Consequently, the ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of the SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.","Wang, P.-H.; Zheng, Y.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Han, L.; Zhang, J.; Nan, M.-L.; Gao, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222026v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222026v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False
163,Oligonucleotide capture sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic fragments from COVID-19 individuals,"The newly emerged and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To facilitate a deeper understanding of the viral biology we developed a capture sequencing methodology to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomic and transcriptome sequences from infected patients. We utilized an oligonucleotide probe-set representing the full-length genome to obtain both genomic and transcriptome (subgenomic open reading frames [ORFs]) sequences from 45 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples with varying viral titers. For samples with higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential transcriptional activity and provided evidence of expression of ORF10. Heterogeneous allelic frequencies along the 20kb ORF1ab gene suggested the presence of a defective interfering viral RNA species subpopulation in one sample. The associated workflow is straightforward, and hybridization-based capture offers an effective and scalable approach for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples.","Doddapaneni, H. V.; Cregeen, S.

164,Molecular mechanisms of Cardiac Injury associated with myocardial SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread around the world. Developing cardiac injury is a common condition in COVID-19 patients, but the pathogenesis remains unclear.

MethodsThe RNA-Seq dataset (GES150392) compared expression profiling of mock human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and SARS-cov-2-infected hiPSC-CMs were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between those two groups. Through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and CLINVAR human diseases analysis to identify the main effect of SARS-CoV-2 on cardiomyocytes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to visualize interactions and functions of the hub genes.

ResultsA total of 1554 DEGs were identified (726 upregulated genes and 828 downregulated genes). Gene enrichment analysis shown that SARS-CoV-2 activate immuno-inflammatory responses via multiple signal pathways, including TNF, IL6-JAK-STAT3, IL2-STAT5, NF-{kappa}B, IL17, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in hiPSC-CMs. Whereas, the muscle contraction, cellular respiration and cell cycle of hiPSC-CMs were inhibited by SARS-CoV-2. CLINVAR human diseases analysis shown SRAS-Cov-2 infection was associated with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. 15 hub genes were identified based on PPI network. Function analysis revealed that 11 upregulated hub genes were mainly enriched in cytokine activity, chemokine activity, Inflammatory response, leukocyte chemotaxis, and lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway. Furthermore, 4 downregulated hub genes were related to cell cycle regulation.

ConclusionThe present study elucidates that the SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a strong defensive response in cardiomyocyte, leading to excessive immune inflammation, cell hypoxia, functional contractility reduction and apoptosis, ultimately result in myocardial injury.","Liu, X.; Lou, L.; Zhou, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.220954v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.220954v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False
165,Development of Remdesivir as a Dry Powder for Inhalation by Thin Film Freezing,"Remdesivir, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral agent, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. To maximize direct delivery to the target site, the lungs, we aim to develop remdesivir as a dry powder for inhalation using thin film freezing (TFF). TFF produces a brittle matrix of nanostructured aggregates that can be sheared into respirable low-density microparticles upon aerosolization from a passive dry powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients (e.g. Captisol(R), mannitol, lactose, leucine) exhibited suitable aerosol performance (up to 92.4% FPF and 0.86 {micro}m MMAD). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which we hypothesize will provide a benefit for drug dissolution once administered to the lungs. Neither the organic/water processing cosolvent or the rapid freezing rate used during the TFF process affected the chemical stability of remdesivir during processing. In conclusion, TFF is a suitable technology for producing remdesivir dry powder formulations suitable for pulmonary administration.","Moon, C.; Sahakijpijarn, S.; Koleng, J. J.; Williams, R.

166,Evaluating SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins as targets for IgG antibody detection in severe and mild COVID-19 cases using a Luminex bead-based assay,"Large-scale serosurveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will only be possible if serological tests are sufficiently reliable, rapid and inexpensive. Current assays are either labour-intensive and require specialised facilities (e.g. virus neutralization assays), or expensive with suboptimal specificity (e.g. commercial ELISAs). Bead-based assays offer a cost-effective alternative and allow for multiplexing to test for antibodies of other pathogens. Here, we compare the performance of four antigens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in a panel of sera that includes both severe (n=40) and mild (n=52) cases, using a neutralization and a Luminex bead-based assay. While we show that neutralising antibody levels are significantly lower in mild than in severe cases, we demonstrate that a combination of recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP), receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the whole spike protein (S1S2) results in a highly sensitive (96%) and specific (99%) bead-based assay that can detect IgG antibodies in both groups. Although S1-specific IgG levels correlate most strongly with neutralizing antibody levels, they fall below the detection threshold in 10% of the cases in our Luminex assay. In conclusion, our data supports the use of RBD, NP and S1S2 for the development of SARS-CoV-2 serological bead-based assays. Finally, we argue that low antibody levels in mild/asymptomatic cases might complicate the epidemiological assessment of large-scale surveillance studies.","Marien, J.; Michiels, J.; Heyndrickx, L.; Kerkhof, K.; Foque, N.; Widdowson, M.-A.; Desombere, I.; Jansens, H.; Van Esbroeck, M.; Arien, K.

167,Epitope-resolved profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response identifies cross-reactivity with an endemic human CoV,"A high-resolution understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is important for the design of effective diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. However, SARS-CoV-2 antibody epitopes remain largely uncharacterized, and it is unknown whether and how the response may cross-react with related viruses. Here, we use a multiplexed peptide assay ( PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of reactivity across all human coronaviruses. PepSeq accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 exposure and resolves epitopes across the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins. Two of these represent recurrent reactivities to conserved, functionally-important sites in the Spike S2 subunit, regions that we show are also targeted for the endemic coronaviruses in pre-pandemic controls. At one of these sites, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 response strongly and recurrently cross-reacts with the endemic virus hCoV-OC43. Our analyses reveal new diagnostic and therapeutic targets, including a site at which SARS-CoV-2 may recruit common pre-existing antibodies and with the potential for broadly-neutralizing responses.","Ladner, J.

168,CAR Macrophages for SARS-CoV-2 Immunotherapy,"Targeted therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially severe cases, are currently lacking. As macrophages have unique effector functions as a first-line defense against invading pathogens, we genetically armed human macrophages with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to reprogram their phagocytic activity against SARS-CoV-2. After investigation of CAR constructs with different intracellular receptor domains, we found that although cytosolic domains from MERTK (CARMERTK) did not trigger antigen-specific cellular phagocytosis or killing effects, unlike those from MEGF10, FcR{gamma} and CD3{zeta} did, these CARs all mediated similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vitro. Notably, we showed that CARMERTK macrophages notably reduced the virion load without upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression. These results suggest that CARMERTK drives an  immunologically silent scavenger effect in macrophages and pave the way for further investigation of CARs for the treatment of individuals with COVID-19, particularly those with severe cases at a high risk of hyperinflammation.","Fu, W.; Lei, C.; Qian, K.; Ma, Z.; Li, T.; Lin, F.; Zhao, J.; Hu, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222208v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.222208v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False

We present a case series raising safety and efficacy concerns in COVID-19 affected patients. Methods: We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients treated at our center and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. Results: Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV treated patients, concentrations in COVID-19 affected patients were 3-fold greater (20.64 +/- 10.14 mcg/mL versus 6.25 mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. The side effects noted were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12, 42%), electrolytes imbalances (4/12, 33%), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12, 42%), and triglyceride elevations (2/12, 17%). Conclusion: None of our patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and efficacy of LPV/r.

Objective: To evaluate trends in ARB use among adults in the United States who have preexisting conditions and sociodemographic risk factors that put them at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related complications and mortality. Design, setting and participants: This study uses the nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2005-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants included 39,749 non-institutionalized U.S. civilian adults who were 20 years and older and those with the most common preexisting conditions and risk factors reported among patients with COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures: Use of ARBs in the prior 30 days from survey interview. Results: ARB use ranged from 7.4% [95% CI, 6.5%-8.4%] to 26.2% [95% CI, 19.4%-34.4%] among those with one or two metabolic, renal, respiratory, and/or cardiovascular diseases. Among individuals with the three most common preexisting conditions in patients with COVID-19 including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, ARB use was higher among the elderly, females, non-Hispanic whites, and those with health insurance coverage.

172,COVID-19 Patients Form Memory CD8+ T Cells that Recognize a Small Set of Shared Immunodominant Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2,"Development of effective strategies to detect, treat, or prevent COVID-19 requires a robust understanding of the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2, including the cellular response mediated by T cells. We used an unbiased, genome-wide screening technology, termed T-Scan, to identify specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the memory CD8+ T cells of 25 COVID-19 convalescent patients, focusing on epitopes presented by the six most prevalent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types: A*02:01, A*01:01, A*03:01, A*11:01, A*24:02, and B*07:02. For each HLA type, the patients' T cells recognized 3-8 immunodominant epitopes that are broadly shared among patients. Remarkably, 94% of screened patients had T cells that recognized at least one of the three most dominant epitopes for a given HLA, and 53% of patients had T cells that recognized all three. Subsequent validation studies in 18 additional A*02:01 patients confirmed the presence of memory CD8+ T cells specific for the top six identified A*02:01 epitopes, and single-cell sequencing revealed that patients often have many different T cell clones targeting each epitope, but that the same T cell receptor Valpha regions are predominantly used to recognize these epitopes, even across patients. In total, we identified 29 shared epitopes across the six HLA types studied. T cells that target most of these immunodominant epitopes (27 of 29) do not cross-react with the endemic coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and the epitopes do not occur in regions with high mutational variation. Notably, only 3 of the 29 epitopes we identified reside in the spike protein, highlighting the need to design new classes of vaccines that recapitulate natural CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Ferretti, A.

Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid 19 and investigate factors associated with death. Methods Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid 19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death. Results 470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57 to 82), and 255 (54.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5%). Forty three (9.1%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3%) received non-invasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year increase above 40 years 1.87, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10 to 2.70), cancer (OR 2.20, 1.27 to 3.81), platelets <150x103/microlitre (OR 1.93, 1.13 to 3.30), C-reactive protein >100 micrograms/mL (OR 1.68, 1.05 to 2.68), >50% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16 to 3.77) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.60, 1.64 to 4.13).

174,Trends of in-hospital and 30-day mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention in England before and after the COVID-19 era,"Objectives: To examine short-term primary causes of death after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a national cohort before and during COVID-19. Background: Public reporting of PCI outcomes is a performance metric and a requirement in many healthcare systems. There are inconsistent data on the causes of death after PCI, and what proportion of these are attributable to cardiac causes. Methods: All patients undergoing PCI in England between 1st January 2017 and 10th May 2020 were retrospectively analysed (n=273,141), according to their outcome from the date of PCI; no death and in-hospital, post-discharge, and 30-day death. Results: The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs. 1.5%), before rising again from 1st March 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of post-discharge mortality. Only 59.6% of 30-day deaths were due to cardiac causes, the most common being acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock and heart failure, and this persisted throughout the study period. 10.4% of 30-day deaths after 1st March 2020 were due to confirmed COVID-19. Conclusions: In this nationwide study, we show that 40% of 30-day deaths are due to non-cardiac causes. Non-cardiac deaths have increased even more from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with one in ten deaths from March 2020 being COVID-19 related.

175,New Insights on Excess Deaths and COVID-19,"Background: Weinberger and colleagues estimated that 27,065 of the 122,300 excess deaths in the United States between March 1 and May 30, 2020 did not have a COVID-19 cause of death. Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post weekly data on mortality for 13 causes of death from the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death. The 2015-2019 data for weeks 10 through 22 were used to forecast the number of deaths from the 13 causes in the absence of COVID-19 during 2020. The forecast was subtracted from the observed number of deaths for each cause during the period March 1 to May 30, 2020. Results: The total of the differences for each of the 13 causes of death, 18,489 deaths, accounts for over two-thirds of the 27,065 excess deaths not due to COVID-19. Conclusion: Combining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13 most frequent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause suggests that as many as 93% of the excess deaths were due to COVID-19 and implies that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted.

Results: Three months after the first cases were detected, the number of positive individuals reached 826 (23 deaths, 112 active cases and 691 recovered). The Uruguayan strategy was based in a close synergy established between the national health authorities and the scientific community. In turn, academia rapidly responded to develop national RT-qPCR tests. Consequently, Uruguay was able to perform ~1,000 molecular tests per day in a matter of weeks. The COVID-19 diagnostic lab network performed more than 54% of the molecular tests in the country. This, together with real-time genomics, were instrumental to implement the TETRIS strategy, helping to contain domestic transmission of the main outbreaks registered so far. Conclusions: Uruguay has successfully navigated the first trimester of the COVID-19 health crisis in South America. A rapid response by the scientific community to increase testing capacity, together with national health authorities seeking out the support from the academia were fundamental to successfully contain, until now, the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.","Moreno, P.; Moratorio, G.

177,Effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19: A Tale of Two Models,"In this paper, we compare the inference regarding the effectiveness of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for COVID-19 obtained from two SIR models, both produced by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. One model was applied to European countries and published in Nature, concluding that complete lockdown was by far the most effective measure and 3 million deaths were avoided in the examined countries. The Imperial College team applied a different model to the USA states. Here, we show that inference is not robust to model specification and indeed changes substantially with the model used for the evolution of the time-varying reproduction number. Applying to European countries the model that the Imperial College team used for the USA states shows that complete lockdown has no or little impact, since it was introduced typically at a point when the time-varying reproduction number was already very low. We also show that results are not robust to the inclusion of additional follow-up data.","Chin, V.; Ioannidis, J.; Tanner, M.; Cripps, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160341v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160341v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,True
178,"Why (and how) COVID-19 could move us closer to the ""health information for all"" goal","In this manuscript, we present an analysis of open access (OA) rates of papers concerning COVID-19 and other important human diseases, whose results helped develop an evidence-based scalable strategy aimed at increasing the full and timely access to medical literature. We show that COVID-19 papers are much more openly available (OA rate of 89.5%) than those concerning the four most recent viral outbreaks (Avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Swine influenza; OA rates (from 26.2% to 51.3%) and the ten non COVID-19 disease categories responsible for the highest number of deaths worldwide (OA rates from 44.0% for Maternal and neonatal disorders to 58.9% for Respiratory infections and tuberculosis). This evidence confronts us with an inevitable question: how can we bridge the gap between OA rates for COVID-19 and other high-impact human diseases? Based on empirical data and projections, we show that it is possible to increase substantially immediate OA to publicly-funded research and complement more demanding initiatives for access to medical literature in developing countries working on the sharing of post-prints at individual, group and multi stakeholder partnership level. However, to make our plan effective in bringing us closer to the health information for all goal a more widespread culture of cooperation is fundamental. We argue that the lesson taught by COVID-19 is a unique opportunity to raise awareness among researchers and stakeholders about the importance of open science for human health and to demonstrate that a real change is now possible.","Capocasa, M.; Destro Bisol, G.; Anagnostou, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160481v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160481v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,True
179,Predicting Critical State after COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Real-World Data from 20152 Confirmed US Cases,"The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 10 million confirmed cases, half a million deaths, and is challenging healthcare systems worldwide. With limited medical resources, early identification of patients with a high risk of progression to severe disease or a critical state is crucial. We present a prognostic model predicting critical state within 28 days following COVID-19 diagnosis trained on data from US electronic health records (EHR) within IBM Explorys, including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory test results, insurance types, and hospitalization. Our entire cohort included 20152 COVID-19 cases, of which 3160 patients went into critical state or died. Random, stratified train-test splits were repeated 100 times to obtain a distribution of performance. The median and interquartile range of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the precision recall curve (PR AUC) were 0.863 [0.857, 0.866] and 0.539 [0.526, 0.550], respectively. Optimizing the decision threshold lead to a sensitivity of 0.796 [0.775, 0.821] and a specificity of 0.784 [0.769, 0.805]. Good model calibration was achieved, showing only minor tendency to over-forecast probabilities above 0.6. The validity of the model was demonstrated by the interpretability analysis confirming existing evidence on major risk factors (e.g., higher age and weight, male gender, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease). The analysis also revealed higher risk for African Americans and ""self-pay patients"". To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset based on EHR used to create a prognosis model for COVID-19. In contrast to large-scale statistics computing odds ratios for individual risk factors, the present model combining a rich set of covariates can provide accurate personalized predictions enabling early treatment to prevent patients from progressing to a severe or critical state.","Rinderknecht, M.

180,"Adapting for the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, a characterization of hospital strategies and patients","Abstract The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on March 11th. In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on February 29th. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overrun the Ecuadorian public health system which became one of the most affected in Latin America with 22,719 cases reported up to April, 24th. Public health control measures, including social distancing and lockdowns, were implemented at different times in the biggest cities of the country: Guayaquil and Quito. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city.","Garzon-Chavez, D.; Romero-Alvarez, D.; Bonifaz, M.; Gaviria, J.; Mero, D.; Gunsha, N.; Perez, A.; Garcia, M.; Espejo, H.; Espinosa, F.; Ligna, E.; Espinel, M.; Quentin, E.; Teran, E.; Mora, F.; Reyes, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161661v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161661v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,True
181,Targeting the endolysosomal host-SARS-CoV-2 interface by the clinically licensed antidepressant fluoxetine,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibits the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.

SignificanceOnly very limited therapeutic options are clinically available for treatment of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals are urgently required. We report that the widely used antidepressant fluoxetine efficiently inhibits the early entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model, and may offer a promising approach for host-directed therapy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.","Schloer, S.; Brunotte, L.; Goretzko, J.; Mecate-Zambrano, A.; Korthals, N.; Gerke, V.; Ludwig, S.; Rescher, U.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.222836v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.222836v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,False
182,Associations of severe COVID-19 with polypharmacy in the REACT-SCOT case-control study,"Objectives -- To investigate the relation of severe COVID-19 to prior drug prescribing. Design -- Matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT) based on record linkage to hospital discharges since June 2015 and dispensed prescriptions issued in primary care during the last 240 days. Setting -- Scottish population. Main outcome measure -- Severe COVID-19, defined by entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Participants -- All 4272 cases of severe COVID-19 in Scotland since the start of the epidemic, with 36948 controls matched for age, sex and primary care practice. Results -- Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with the number of non-cardiovascular drug classes dispensed. This association was strongest in those not resident in care homes, in whom the rate ratio (95% CI) associated with dispensing of 12 or more drug classes versus none was 10.8 (8.7, 13.2), and was not accounted for by treatment of conditions designated as conferring increased risk. Of 17 drug classes postulated at the start of the epidemic to be ""medications compromising COVID"", all were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The largest effect was for antipsychotic agents: rate ratio 4.14 (3.39, 5.07). Other drug classes with large effects included proton pump inhibitors (rate rato 2.19 (1.70, 2.80) for >= 2 defined daily doses/day), opioids (3.62 (2.65, 4.94) for >= 50 mg morphine equivalent/day) and gabapentinoids. These associations persisted after adjusting for covariates, and were stronger with recent than with non-recent exposure. Conclusions -- Severe COVID-19 is associated with polypharmacy and with drugs that cause sedation, respiratory depression or dyskinesia, have anticholinergic effects or affect the gastrointestinal system. These associations are not easily explained by co-morbidity. Although the evidence for causality is not conclusive, these results support existing guidance on reducing overprescribing of these drug classes and limiting inappropriate polypharmacy as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 risk.

184,Using social contact data to predict and compare the impact of social distancing policies with implications for school re-opening,"Background Social distancing measures, including school closures, are being used to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in many countries. Once ""lockdown"" has driven incidence to low levels, selected activities are being permitted. Re-opening schools is a priority because of the welfare and educational impact of closures on children. However, the impact of school re-opening needs to be considered within the context of other measures. Methods We use social contact data from the UK to predict the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number. We calibrate our tool to the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK using publicly available death data and Google Community Mobility Reports. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a back-drop of wider social distancing easing. Results We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data, combined with incidence data and Google Community Mobility Reports, is able to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). From an pre-control setting when R=2.7 (95%CI 2.5, 2.9), we estimate that the minimum reproduction number that can be achieved in the UK without limiting household contacts is 0.45 (95%CI:0.41-0.50); in the absence of other changes, preventing leisure contacts has a smaller impact (R=2.0,95%CI:1.8-2.4) than preventing work contacts (R=1.5,95%CI:1.4-1.7). We find that following lockdown (when R=0.7 (95% CI 0.6, 0.8)), opening primary schools in isolation has a modest impact on transmission R=0.83 (95%CI:0.77-0.90) but that high adherence to other measures is needed. Opening secondary schools as well as primary school is predicted to have a larger overall impact (R=0.95,95%CI:0.85-1.07), however transmission could still be controlled with effective contact tracing. Conclusions Our findings suggest that primary school children can return to school without compromising transmission, however other measures, such as social distancing and contract tracing, are required to control transmission if all age groups are to return to school. Our tool provides a mapping from policies to the reproduction number and can be used by policymakers to compare the impact of social-easing measures, dissect mitigation strategies and support careful localized control strategies.","Brooks-Pollock, E.; Read, J.

185,Functional mapping of B-cell linear epitopes 1 of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent population,"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 10 million people and caused over 500,000 mortalities. Vaccine development is in urgent need to stop the pandemic. Despite great progresses on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, the efficacy of the vaccines remains to be determined. Deciphering the interactions of the viral epitopes with their elicited neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent COVID-19 population inspires the vaccine development. In this study, we devised a peptide array composed of 20-mer overlapped peptides of spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, and performed a screening with 120 COVID-19 convalescent serums and 24 non-COVID-19 serums. We identified five SARS-CoV-2-specific dominant epitopes that reacted with above 40% COVID-19 convalescent serums. Epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S ill reacted with the convalescent serums. Of note, two peptides non-specifically interacted with most of the non-COVID-19 serums. Neutralization assay indicated that only five serums completely blocked viral infection at the dilution of 1:200. By using a peptide-compete neutralizing assay, we found that three dominant epitopes partially competed the neutralization activity of several convalescent serums, suggesting antibodies elicited by these epitopes played an important role in neutralizing viral infection. The epitopes we identified in this study may serve as vaccine candidates to elicit neutralizing antibodies in most vaccinated people or specific antigens for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Yi, Z.; Ling, Y.; Zhang, X.; Chen, J.; Hu, K.; Wang, Y.; Song, W.; Ying, T.; Zhang, R.; Lu, H.; Yuan, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161869v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161869v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,True
186,Mathematical modelling based study and prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination under the impact of lockdown in India,"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading in South Asian countries especially in India. India is the fourth most COVID-19 affected country at present (as on July 10, 2020). With limited medical facilities and high transmission rate, study of COVID-19 progression and its subsequence trajectory need to be analyzed in India. Epidemiologic mathematical models have the potential to predict the epidemic peak of COVID-19 under different scenario. Lockdown is one of the most effective mitigation policy adapted worldwide to control the transmission rate of COVID-19 cases. In this study, we use an improvised five compartment mathematical model i.e. Susceptible (S) - exposed (E)- infected (I)- recovered (R)- death (D) (SEIRD) to investigate the progression of COVID-19 and predict the epidemic peak under the impact of lockdown in India. The aim of this study to provide the most accurate prediction of epidemic peak and to evaluate the impact of lockdown on epidemic peak shift in India. For this purpose, we examine most recent data (up to July 10, 2020) to enhance the accuracy of outcomes from the proposed model. The obtained results indicate that COVID-19 epidemic peak would appear on around mid-August 2020 in India and corresponding estimated cases would be 2.5X10^6 under current scenario. In addition, our study indicates that existence of under-reported cases (~10^5) during post-lockdown period in India. It is expected that nationwide lockdown would lead to epidemic peak suppression in India. The obtained results would be beneficial for determining further COVID-19 mitigation policies not only in India but globally.","Tiwari, V.; Bisht, N.; Deyal, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161885v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.25.20161885v1?rss=1,2020-07-27,2020-07-27,,True
187,The Outcome of COVID-19 Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding global pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients may present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to conduct detailed analysis on patients with AMI and COVID-19. Methods We included all patients admitted with AMI and actively known or found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR between the 4th February 2020 and the 11th June 2020 in the State of Qatar. Patients were divided into ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-STE (NSTEMI). Results There were 68 patients (67 men and 1 woman) admitted between the 4th of February 2020 and the 11th of June 2020 with AMI and COVID-19. The mean age was 49.1, 46 patients had STEMI and 22 had NSTEMI. 38% had diabetes mellitus, 31% had hypertension, 16% were smokers, 13% had dyslipidemia, and 14.7% had prior cardiovascular disease. Chest pain and dyspnea were the presenting symptoms in 90% and 12% of patients respectively. Fever (15%) and cough (15%) were the most common COVID-19 symptoms, while the majority had no viral symptoms. Thirty-nine (33 STEMI and 6 NSTEMI) patients underwent coronary angiography, 38 of them had significant coronary disease. Overall in-hospital MACE was low; 1 patient developed stroke and 2 died. Conclusion Contrary to previous small reports, overall in-hospital adverse events were low in this largest cohort of COVID-19 patients presenting with AMI. We hypothesize patient profile including younger age contributed to these findings.

189,Assessing the quality of nontraditional N95 filtering face-piece respirators available during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, supply chains for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) have been severely disrupted and many products, particularly surgical N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs; ""masks"") are in short supply. As a consequence, an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA has allowed importation of N95-type masks manufactured to international standards; these include KN95 masks from China and FFP2 masks from the European Union. Methods: We conducted a survey of mask in the inventory of major academic medical centers in Boston, MA to determine provenance and manufacturer. We then assembled a simple apparatus for performing a necessary (but not sufficient) test of filtration performance and tested masks from the inventory; an accompanying website shows how to build and use the testing apparatus. Results: Our survey showed that, seven months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 different makes and models of N95-type masks are in the inventory of local hospitals as opposed to 2-5 models under normal circumstances. A substantial number of unfamiliar masks are from unknown manufacturers. Many did not perform to accepted standards and are likely to be counterfeit. Due to the absence of publicly available information on mask suppliers in the FDA EUA and confusing or inconsistent labeling of KN95 masks, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate and counterfeit products. Conclusions: Many of the FFR masks available for procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic do not provide levels of fit and filtration similar to those of N95 masks and are not acceptable for use in healthcare settings. Based on these results, and in consultation with occupational health officers, we make six recommendations for end users to assist in acquiring legitimate products. In particular, institutions should always assess masks from non-traditional supply chains by checking their markings and manufacturer information against data provided by NIOSH and the latest FDA EUA Appendix A.

190,Power Law in COVID-19 Cases in China,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China in December 2019. Within a short period of time, the infectious disease has spread far and wide. This study focuses on the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China---the original epicenter of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent less than one, and that a random proportionate growth model predicated by Gibrat's law is a plausible explanation for the emergence of the observed power law behavior. This finding is significant because it implies that COVID-19 cases in China is heavy-tailed and disperse, that a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases, and that the distribution has no finite mean or variance. The power-law distributedness has implications for effective planning and policy design as well as efficient use of government resources.","Ahundjanov, B. B.; Akhundjanov, S. B.; Okhunjanov, B.

191,North American deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2,"The zoonotic spillover of the pandemic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from an animal reservoir, currently presumed to be the Chinese horseshoe bat, into a naive human population has rapidly resulted in a significant global public health emergency. Worldwide circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans raises the theoretical risk of reverse zoonosis events with wildlife, reintroductions of SARS-CoV-2 into permissive non-domesticated animals, potentially seeding new host reservoir species and geographic regions in which bat SARS-like coronaviruses have not historically been endemic. Here we report that North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and some closely related members of the Cricetidae family of rodents possess key amino acid residues within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to confer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding. Peromyscus rodent species are widely distributed across North America and are the primary host reservoirs of several emerging pathogens that repeatedly spill over into humans including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, deer tick virus, and Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We demonstrate that adult deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection following intranasal exposure to a human isolate, resulting in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract with little or no signs of disease. Further, shed infectious virus is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to naive deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and/or the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Nevertheless, efforts to monitor wild, peri-domestic Peromyscus rodent populations are likely warranted as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses.","Griffin, B. D.; Chan, M.; Tailor, N.; Mendoza, E.

192,Daily Forecasting of New Cases for Regional Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification,"To increase situational awareness and support evidence-based policy-making, we formulated two types of mathematical models for COVID-19 transmission within a regional population. One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting. We infer new significant upward trends for five of the metropolitan areas starting between 19-April-2020 and 12-June-2020.","Lin, Y. T.; Neumann, J.; Miller, E. F.; Posner, R.

193,Serial Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Antigens and Antibodies in COVID-19 Patient Plasma,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide. PCR tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and serology tests are used to detect seroconversion in infected patients. However, there is a lack of quantitative and ultra-sensitive viral antigen tests for COVID-19. Here we show that Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays can quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we show correlation between production of antibodies and clearance of viral antigens from serial plasma samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of viral antigens in blood correlates with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in the blood could be a marker for severe COVID-19 cases.","Ogata, A. F.; Maley, A.

194,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibodies in Utsunomiya City, Greater Tokyo, after first pandemic in 2020 (U-CORONA): a household- and population-based study","Background: The number of confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Japan are substantially lower in comparison to the US and UK, potentially due to the under-implementation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Studies reported that more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, confirming the importance for conducting seroepidemiological studies. Although the seroepidemiological studies in Japan observed a reported prevalence of 0.10% in Tokyo, 0.17% in Osaka, and 0.03% in Miyagi, sampling bias was not considered. The study objective was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random sample of households in Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, Japan. Methods: We launched the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) Study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Utsunomiya City. The survey was conducted between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Invitations enclosed with a questionnaire were sent to 2,290 people in 1,000 households randomly selected from Utsunomiya basic resident registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Among 2,290 candidates, 753 returned the questionnaire and 742 received IgG tests (32.4 % participation rate). Of the 742 participants, 86.8% were 18 years or older, 52.6% were women, 71.1% were residing within 10 km from the test clinic, and 89.2% were living with another person. The age and sex distribution, distance to clinic and police district were similar with those of non-participants, while the proportion of single-person households was higher among non-participants than participants (16.2% vs. 10.8%). We confirmed three positive cases through quantitative antibody testing. No positive cases were found among the people who live in the same household as someone with positive. All cases were afebrile. The estimated unweighted and weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.40% (95% confidence interval: 0.08-1.18%) and 1.23% (95% confidence interval: 0.17-2.28%), respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests the importance of detecting all cases using PCR or antigen testing, not only at a hospital, but also in areas where people assemble.

195,"Recent smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19: a preregistered, cross-sectional study","Background: COVID-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19. Methods: This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Results: Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean{+/-}SD, C19+: -82.5{+/-}27.2 points; C19-: -59.8{+/-}37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing no significant model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset. Conclusions: As smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss. Numeric ratings [&le;]2 indicate high odds of symptomatic COVID-19 (10<OR<4), especially when viral lab tests are impractical or unavailable.","Gerkin, R. C.; Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M. G.; Joseph, P.

196,COVIDOSE: Low-dose tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid-19,"Background Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated hyperinflammation may contribute to the high mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody, has been repurposed for Covid-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in Covid-19 are lacking. Methods We conducted a phase 2 trial of low-dose tocilizumab in hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >= 40 mg/L who did not require mechanical ventilation. Dose cohorts were determined by a trial Operations Committee, stratified by CRP and epidemiologic risk factors. A range of doses from 40 to 200 mg (low-dose tocilizumab) was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24-48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Outcomes were compared with retrospective controls with Covid-19. Correlative studies evaluating host antibody response were performed in parallel. Findings A total of 32 patients received low-dose tocilizumab. This cohort had improved fever resolution (75.0% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.001) and CRP decline (86.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration, as compared to the retrospective controls (N=41). The probabilities of fever resolution or CRP decline did not appear to be dose-related in this small study (p=0.80 and p=0.10, respectively). Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (15.6%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (15.6%) patients. Correlative biological studies demonstrated that tocilizumab-treated patients produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies comparable to controls. Interpretation Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Results of this trial and its correlative biological studies provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in Covid-19.","Strohbehn, G. W.; Heiss, B. L.; Rouhani, S.

197,Healthcare Workers' Mental Health and Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK: Contrasting Guidelines with Experiences in Practice,"Background Substantial evidence has highlighted the importance of considering healthcare workers' (HCW) mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several organisations have issued guidelines with recommendations. However, the definition of wellbeing and the evidence-base behind such guidelines remains unclear. Objectives Assessing the applicability of wellbeing guidelines in practice; identify unaddressed HCWs' needs; and provide recommendations for supporting frontline staff during the current and future pandemics. Methods and Design This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with frontline healthcare staff in the UK and examines them in relation to a rapid review of wellbeing guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 14 guidelines were included in the rapid review and 33 interviews with HCWs were conducted in the qualitative study. As a whole, the guidelines placed greater emphasis on wellbeing at an individual level, while HCWs placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, such as understaffing and the invaluable support of the community. This in turn had implications for the focus of wellbeing intervention strategies; staff reported an increased availability of formal mental health support, however, understaffing or clashing schedules prevented them from participating in these activities. Conclusion HCWs expressed wellbeing needs which align with social-ecological conceptualisations of wellbeing related to quality of life. This approach to wellbeing has been highlighted in literature about HCWs support in previous health emergencies, yet it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Wellbeing guidelines should explore staff's needs and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, N.; Aceituno, D.; Djellouli, N.; Sumray, K.; Regenold, N.; Syversen, A.; Mulcahy Symmons, S.; Dowrick, A.; Mitchinson, L.; Singleton, G.; Vindrola-Padros, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20156711v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20156711v1?rss=1,2020-07-26,2020-07-26,,True
198,Association of contact to small children with mild course of COVID-19,"It is known that severe COVID-19 cases in small children are rare. If a childhood-related infection would be protective against severe course of COVID-19, it would be expected that adults with intensive and regular contact to small children also may have a mild course of COVID-19 more frequently. To test this hypothesis, a survey among 4,010 recovered COVID-19 patients was conducted in Germany. 1,186 complete answers were collected. 6.9% of these patients reported frequent and regular job-related contact to children below 10 years of age and 23.2% had own small children, which is higher than expected. In the relatively small subgroup with intensive care treatment (n=19), patients without contact to small children were overrepresented. These findings are not well explained by age, gender or BMI distribution of those patients and should be validated in other settings.","Dugas, M.; Schrempf, I.

200,Dysregulated transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the periphery support novel diagnostic approaches,"In order to elucidate novel aspects of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 we performed RNA sequencing on peripheral blood samples across 77 timepoints from 46 subjects with COVID-19 and compared them to subjects with seasonal coronavirus, influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy controls. Early SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a conserved transcriptomic response in peripheral blood that is heavily interferon-driven but also marked by indicators of early B-cell activation and antibody production. Interferon responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrate unique patterns of dysregulated expression compared to other infectious and healthy states. Heterogeneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are present in early COVID-19, as are IL1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, that persist into late disease. Classifiers based on differentially expressed genes accurately distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from other acute illnesses (auROC 0.95).

Thus, to be informed on Nephrology personnel's sero-status might be crucial for patient protection. However, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. Methods: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies among health care workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the peak phase of the Covid-19 crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. Results: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% CI: 20.4-31.5) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about two weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8) and IgM positivity in six (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0) of health care workers showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least two assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven Covid-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from health care workers did not show SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. Conclusions: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among Covid-19 patients.","Reiter, T.; Pajenda, S.; Wagner, L.; Gaggl, M.; Atamaniuk, J.; Holzer, B.; Zimpernik, I.; Gerges, D.; Mayer, K.; Aigner, C.; Strassl, R.; Jansen-Skoupy, S.; Födinger, M.; Sunder-Plassmann, G.; Schmidt, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20136218v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20136218v1?rss=1,2020-07-26,2020-07-26,,True

Methods An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with non-severe disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19 and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. Results We show that routine clinical blood parameters including increased MPV and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin and TPO were also significantly elevated in COVID-19. Conclusion Distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined that COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest that abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19. Further investigation of platelet function in COVID-19 may provide additional insights into the aetiology of thrombotic risk in this disease and may contribute to the optimisation of thrombosis prevention and treatment strategies.","Comer, S.

204,Systematic evaluation and external validation of 22 prognostic models among hospitalised adults with COVID-19: An observational cohort study,"Background The number of proposed prognostic models for COVID-19, which aim to predict disease outcomes, is growing rapidly. It is not known whether any are suitable for widespread clinical implementation. We addressed this question by independent and systematic evaluation of their performance among hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study to assess candidate prognostic models, identified through a living systematic review. We included consecutive adults admitted to a secondary care hospital with PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed community-acquired COVID-19 (1st February to 30th April 2020). We reconstructed candidate models as per their original descriptions and evaluated performance for their original intended outcomes (clinical deterioration or mortality) and time horizons. We assessed discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and calibration using calibration plots, slopes and calibration-in-the-large. We calculated net benefit compared to the default strategies of treating all and no patients, and against the most discriminating predictor in univariable analyses, based on a limited subset of a priori candidates. Results We tested 22 candidate prognostic models among a cohort of 411 participants, of whom 180 (43.8%) and 115 (28.0%) met the endpoints of clinical deterioration and mortality, respectively. The highest AUROCs were achieved by the NEWS2 score for prediction of deterioration over 24 hours (0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.83), and a novel model for prediction of deterioration <14 days from admission (0.78; 0.74-0.82). Calibration appeared generally poor for models that used probability outcomes. In univariable analyses, admission oxygen saturation on room air was the strongest predictor of in-hospital deterioration (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81), while age was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81). No prognostic model demonstrated consistently higher net benefit than using the most discriminating univariable predictors to stratify treatment, across a range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions Oxygen saturation on room air and patient age are strong predictors of deterioration and mortality among hospitalised adults with COVID-19, respectively. None of the prognostic models evaluated offer incremental value for patient stratification to these univariable predictors.","Gupta, R. K.; Marks, M.; Samuels, T. H.

205,Previous and active tuberculosis in COVID-19 patients increases risk of death and prolongs recovery,"Background: There is a growing literature on the association of SARS-CoV-2 and other chronic conditions, such as noncommunicable diseases. However, little is known about the impact of coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Methods: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Results: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25% lower than in those without (RR=0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p=0.0046). Conclusions: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Sy, K. T.

207,"Viral RNA level, serum antibody responses, and transmission risk in discharged COVID-19 patients with recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results: a population-based observational cohort study","Background Managing discharged COVID-19 (DC) patients with recurrent positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results is challenging. We aimed to comprehensively characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in RP-DC patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk. Methods A population-based observational cohort study was performed on 479 DC patients discharged from February 1 to May 5, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. We conducted RT-qPCR, antibody assays, neutralisation assays, virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and epidemiological investigation of close contacts. Findings Of 479 DC patients, the 93 (19%) RP individuals, including 36 with multiple RP results, were characterised by young age (median age: 34 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-38 years). The median discharge-to-RP length was 8 days (95% CI: 7-14 days; maximum: 90 days). After readmission, RP-DC patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in RP-DC patients ranged from 1.9-5.7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3.2, 95% CI: 3.1-3.5). At RP detection, the IgM, IgG, IgA, total antibody, and neutralising antibody (NAb) seropositivity rates in RP-DC patients were 38% (18/48), 98% (47/48), 63% (30/48), 100% (48/48), and 91% (39/43), respectively. Regarding antibody levels, there was no significant difference between RP-DC and non-RP-DC patients. The antibody level remained constant in RP-DC patients pre- and post-RP detection. Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. WGS of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. No clinical symptoms were exhibited by 96 close contacts of 23 RP-DC patients; their viral RNA (96/96) and antibody (20/20) test results were negative. After full recovery, 60% of patients (n=162, 78 no longer RP RP-DC and 84 non-RP-DC) had NAb titres of [&ge;]1:32. Interpretation RP may occur in DC patients following intermittent and non-stable excretion of low viral RNA levels. RP-DC patients pose a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. An NAb titre of [&ge;]1:32 may provide a reference indicator for evaluating humoral responses in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.","Yang, C.; Jiang, M.; Wang, X.; Tang, X.; Fang, S.; Li, H.; Zuo, L.; Jiang, Y.; Zhong, Y.; Chen, Q.; Zheng, C.; Wang, L.; Wu, S.; Wu, W.; Liu, H.; Yuan, J.; Liao, X.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Y.; Geng, Y.; Zhang, H.; Zheng, H.; Wan, M.; Lu, L.; Ren, X.; Cui, Y.; Zou, X.; Feng, T.; Xia, J.; Yang, R.; Liu, Y.; Mei, S.; Li, B.; Yang, Z.; Hu, Q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20125138v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20125138v1?rss=1,2020-07-26,2020-07-26,,True
208,Potential impact of individual exposure histories to endemic human coronaviruses on age-dependence in severity of COVID-19,"Cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 from previous exposure to endemic coronaviruses (eHCoV) is gaining increasing attention as a possible driver of both protection against infection and severity of COVID-19 disease. Here, we use a stochastic individual-based model to show that heterogeneities in individual exposure histories to endemic coronaviruses are able to explain observed age patterns of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK, provided there is (i) a decrease in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 with the number of eHCoV exposures and (ii) an increase in potential disease severity with number of eHCoV exposures or as a result of immune senescence. We also show that variation in health care capacity and testing efforts is compatible with country-specific differences in hospitalisation rates. Our findings call for further research on the role of cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses and highlight potential challenges arising from heterogeneous health care capacity and testing.","Pinotti, F.; Wikramaratna, P.

209,"The adequacy of health system measures in reducing vulnerability to COVID 19 among the health care providers working in primary health care in Rajasthan, India A Cross sectional Study","Background This paper examines the role of individual, facility and system level preparedness in reducing the physiological and psychological vulnerability among primary-level health care providers (HCPs) of COVID19 pandemic in Rajasthan, India. Method and Material Online and telephonic interviews are conducted among 274 HCPs working in 24 PHCs (17 rural and 7 urban), across 13 districts of Rajasthan. Five dimensions of vulnerability covering awareness, exposure to infection (daily contact; contact with high risk individuals), physical and mental health conditions, while three aspects of preparedness at individual (personal care) and facility (provider safety; management and supervision) level are measured by employing factor analysis. Generalized ordered logit regression model is used to measure the effect of preparedness on COVID19 related vulnerability. Result: Among the 274 HCPs, majority of the staff are from rural PHCs (76 %), less than 35 years (87%), female (57%) and married (57 %). Almost half have high level exposure to COVID19, with mean contact rate is 90. Overall, 26% have comprehensive knowledge on COVID19, and 32% have any mental health issues. Although more than 70% of HCPs have reported more than one individual level preparedness, mental health measures adopted by the HCPs are comparably low. The facility level preparedness for enhancing safety are high such as social distance (79%) and maintaining record of each visitor (75%). However, management related measures adopted by the PHCs are perceived to be lower than the safety measures. The regression analyses suggest that safety related preparedness is significantly associated with reduction of vulnerability by 50%. The management-level preparedness has statistically no significant effect in explaining the variations in level of vulnerability. Conclusion: The facility-level safety measures, which lowers chances of acquiring infection has a positive effect on reducing vulnerability of COVID19. However, the HCPs do not have adequate preparedness at individual, facility management (PHC) and system level to reduce COVID19 vulnerability. Findings suggest that there is a need for a non-conventional approach of monitoring and supervision, in the absence of such measures there is a chance of moral injury that will make the HCPs at the primary level vulnerable to both physiologically and psychologically.","Das, A.

211,CoVaccine HT™ adjuvant potentiates robust immune responses to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 immunisation,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions, globally. The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralising antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Haun, B. K.; Lai, C.-Y.; Williams, C. A.; Wong, T.

212,Evidence of gender bias in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients: A Big Data analysis of Electronic Health Records,"Background: It remains unknown whether the frequency and severity of COVID-19 affect women differently than men. Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a test-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than males (61.7{+/-}19.4 vs. 63.3{+/-}18.3, p=0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59 yr.-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (SR; 95% CI) observed in the 30-39 yr.-old interval (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p<0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and ICU admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p<0.001.

We measured the percentage of severe acute respiratory syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositive individuals from 2,008 blood donors drawn in the state of Rhode Island (RI). We utilized multiple antibody testing platforms, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). We report than an estimated seropositive rate of RI blood donors of approximately 0.6% existed in April-May of 2020. These data imply that seroconversion, and thus infection, is likely not widespread within this population. Daily new case rates peaked in RI in late April 2020. We conclude that IgG LFAs and HTSAs are suitable to conduct seroprevalence assays in random populations. More studies will be needed using validated serological tests to improve the precision and report the kinetic progression of seroprevalence estimates.","Nesbitt, D. J.; Jin, D.; Hogan, J.

214,The neuropeptides VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in monocytes and lung epithelial cells and decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells.,"Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may elicit uncontrolled and damaging inflammatory reactions, due to an excessive immune response and dysregulated production of cytokines and chemokines. Thus, it is critical to identify compounds able to inhibit virus replication and thwart the excessive inflammatory reaction and tissue lesions secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that the neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, molecules endowed with immunoregulatory properties, were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis/replication in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells. VIP and PACAP protected these cells from virus-induced cytopathicity, reduced the production of proinflammmatory mediators, and prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced NF-kB activation, which is critically involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. Both neuropeptides promoted CREB activation in infected monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and also a negative regulator of NF-kB. As a possible host response to control patient inflammation, we identified that VIP levels were elevated in plasma from patients with severe forms of COVID-19, correlating with the inflammatory marker CRP and survival on those patients. Since a synthetic form of VIP is clinically approved in Europe and under two clinical trials for patients with COVID-19, our results provide the scientific evidence to further support clinical investigation of these neuropeptides against COVID-19.","Temerozo, J.

215,No evidence for basigin/CD147 as a direct SARS-CoV-2 spike binding receptor,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is known to enable viral invasion into human cells through direct binding to host receptors including ACE2. An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.","Shilts, J.; Wright, G.

216,Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as vaccine candidate,"Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, this virus has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major antigen that notably induces neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry. Many COVID-19 vaccines are under development, among them viral vectors expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit many benefits. Viral vector vaccines have the potential of being used as both live or inactivated vaccines and they can induce Th1 and Th2-based immune responses following different immunization regimens. Additionally, viral vector vaccines can be handled under BSL-2 conditions and they grow to high titers in cell cultures or other species restricted-hosts. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, several viral vectors are being tested, such as adenovirus, measles virus and Modified vaccinia Ankara.

Added value of this studyThe NDV vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study has advantages similar to those of other viral vector vaccines. But the NDV vector can be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs, which allows for high yields and low costs per dose. Also, the NDV vector is not a human pathogen, therefore the delivery of the foreign antigen would not be compromised by any pre-existing immunity in humans. Finally, NDV has a very good safety record in humans, as it has been used in many oncolytic virus trials. This study provides an important option for a cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study informs of the value of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, for this NDV based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufactures in the U.S. and worldwide would have the capacity to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of doses to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, W.; Leist, S.

217,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variant D614G Favors an Open Conformational State,"The COVID-19 pandemic underwent a rapid transition with the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that carried the amino acid substitution D614G in the Spike protein that became globally prevalent. The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.","Mansbach, R.

218,Clinical Outcomes With the Use of Prophylactic Versus Therapeutic Anticoagulation in COVID-19,"Background: This study is the first of its kind to assess the impact of preemptive therapeutic dose anticoagulation on mortality compared to prophylactic anticoagulation among COVID-19 patients. Its findings provide insight to clinicians regarding the management of COVID-19, particularly with the known prothrombotic state. Research Question: To determine the impact of anticoagulation on in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 positive patients with the a priori hypothesis that there would be a lower risk of in-hospital mortality with use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic dose enoxaparin or heparin. Study Design and Methods: Study Design: Retrospective cohort study from April 1 - April 25, 2020. The date of final follow-up was June 12, 2020. Setting: Two large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut. Participants: Five hundred and one inpatients were identified after discharge as 18 years or older and positive for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample size included 374 patients after applying exclusion criteria. Demographic variables were collected via hospital billing inquiries, while the clinical variables were abstracted from patients medical records. Exposure: Preemptive enoxaparin or heparin at a therapeutic or prophylactic dose. Main Outcome: In-hospital mortality. Results: When comparing preemptive therapeutic to prophylactic anticoagulation through multi-variable analysis, risk of in-hospital mortality was 2.3 times greater in patients receiving preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation (95% CI = 1.0, 4.9; p = 0.04). Interpretation: An increase in in-hospital mortality was observed with preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation. Thus, in the management of COVID-19 and its complications, we recommend further research and cautious use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic anticoagulation.","Motta, J. K.; Ogunnaike, R.

219,A Cluster-Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Prevention of Covid-19 Transmission and Disease,"Background Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are limited to non-pharmacological interventions. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. Methods We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. Results The analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2% usual care vs. 5.7% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8% usual care vs. 18.7% HCQ). The incidence of AEs was higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (5.9% usual care vs 51.6% HCQ), but no treatment-related serious AEs were reported. Conclusions Postexposure therapy with HCQ did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection in healthy individuals exposed to a PCR-positive case. Our findings do not support HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis for Covid-19.","Mitja, O.; Ubals, M.; Corbacho, M.; Alemany, A.; Suner, C.; Tebe, C.; Tobias, A.; Penafiel, J.; Ballana, E.; Perez, C.

220,"Comparison of viral levels in individuals with or without symptoms at time of COVID-19 testing among 32,480 residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts.","Background Transmission of COVID-19 from people without symptoms poses considerable challenges to public health containment measures. The distribution of viral loads in individuals with and without symptoms remains uncertain. Comprehensive cross-sectional screening of all individuals in a given setting provides an unbiased way to assess viral loads independent of symptoms, which informs transmission risks. COVID-19 cases initially peaked in Massachusetts in mid-April 2020 before declining through June, and congregate living facilities were particularly affected during this early surge. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a large public health-directed outbreak response initiative that involved comprehensive screening within nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts to compare nasopharyngeal (NP) viral loads (as measured by RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) levels) in residents and staff to inform our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with or without symptoms in the population. Methods Between April 9 and June 9, 2020, we tested NP swabs from 32,480 unique individuals comprising staff and residents of the majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts. Under the direction of the MA Department of Public Health (MDPH), symptomatology at the time of sampling and demographic information was provided by each facility for each individual to facilitate reporting to health officials. NP swabs were collected, RNA extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 testing performed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results The nursing home and assisted living facilities resident cohort (N =16,966) was 65% female with a mean age of 82 years (SD 13 yrs). The staff cohort (N = 15,514) was 76% female with a median age of 45 (SD 15 yrs). A total 2654 residents (15.5%) and 624 staff (4.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 12.7% of residents and 3.7% of staff without symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to 53.1% of residents and 18.2% of staff with symptoms. Of the individuals who tested positive, 70.8% of residents and 92.4% of staff lacked symptoms at the time of testing. In aggregate, the distributions of Cts for viral probes used in the qRT-PCR assay were very similar, with a statistically but not meaningfully different mean ({triangleup}Ct 0.71 cycles, p = 0.006) and a similar range (12-38 cycles), between populations with and without symptoms over the entire time period, across all sub-categories examined (age, race, ethnicity, sex, resident/staff). Importantly, the Ct mean values and range were indistinguishable between the populations by symptom class during the peak of the outbreak in Massachusetts, with a Ct gap appearing only later in the survey period, reaching >3 cycles (p [&le;] 0.001) for facilities sampled during the last two weeks of the study. Conclusions In a large cohort of individuals screened for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, we found strikingly similar distributions of viral load in patients with or without symptoms at the time of testing during the local peak of the epidemic; as the epidemic waned, individuals without symptoms at the time of testing had lower viral loads. The size of the study population, including both staff and residents spanning a wide range of ages, provides a comprehensive cross-sectional point prevalence measurement of viral burden in a study spanning 2 months. Because the distributions of viral loads in infected individuals irrespective of symptomatology are very similar, existing testing modalities that have been validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients should perform similarly in individuals without symptoms at the time of testing.","Lennon, N.

221,A new model to prioritize and optimize access to elective surgery throughout the COVID-19 pandemic: A feasibility & pilot study.,"Background The COVID-19 outbreak burdens non-COVID elective surgery patients with figures similar to the SARS-Cov-2, by creating an overwhelming demand, increasing waiting times and costs. New tools are urgently needed to manage elective access. The study assesses the SWALIS-2020 model ability to prioritize and optimize access to surgery during the pandemic. Methods A 2020 March - May feasibility-pilot study, tested a software-aided, inter-hospital, multidisciplinary pathway. All specialties patients in the Genoa Departments referred for urgent elective surgery were included in a multidisciplinary pathway adopting a modified Surgical Waiting List InfoSystem (SWALIS) cumulative prioritization method (PAT-2020) based on waiting time and clinical urgency, in three subcategories: A1-15 days (certain rapid disease progression), A2-21 days (probable progression), and A3-30 days (potential progression). Results Following the feasibility study (N=55 patients), 240 referrals were evaluated in 4 weeks without major criticalities (M/F=73/167, Age=68.7 +/- 14.0). Waiting lists were prioritized and monitored, and theatres allocated based on demand. The SWALIS-2020 score (% of waited-against-maximum time) at operation was 88.7 +/- 45.2 at week 1 and then persistently over 100% (efficiency), over a controlled variation (equity), with a difference between A3 (153.29 +/- 103.52) vs. A1 (97.24 +/- 107.93) (p <0.001), and A3 vs. A2 (88.05 +/- 77.51) (p <0.001). 222 patients underwent surgery, without related complications or delayed/failed discharges. Conclusions The pathway has selected the very few patients with the greatest need, optimizing access even with +30% capacity weekly modifications. We will use the pathway to manage active, backlog, and hidden waiting lists throughout the further pandemic phases, and are looking for collaboration for multi-center research. https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11384058.","Valente, R.; Di Domenico, S.; Santori, G.; Mascherini, M.; Papadia, F.; Orengo, G.; Gratarola, A.; Cafiero, F.; De Cian, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20157719v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20157719v1?rss=1,2020-07-26,2020-07-26,,True
222,3D Printed frames to enable reuse and improve the fit of N95 and KN95 respirators,"Background: In response to supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs or ""masks""), which are typically single-use devices in healthcare settings, are routinely being used for prolonged periods and in some cases decontaminated under ""reuse"" and ""extended use"" policies. However, the reusability of N95 masks is often limited by degradation or breakage of elastic head bands and issues with mask fit after repeated use. The purpose of this study was to develop a frame for N95 masks, using readily available materials and 3D printing, which could replace defective or broken bands and improve fit. Results: An iterative design process yielded a mask frame consisting of two 3D-printed side pieces, malleable wire links that users press against their face, and cut lengths of elastic material that go around the head to hold the frame and mask in place. Volunteers (n= 41; average BMI= 25.5), of whom 31 were women, underwent qualitative fit with and without mask frames and one or more of four different brands of FFRs conforming to US N95 or Chinese KN95 standards. Masks passed qualitative fit testing in the absence of a frame at rates varying from 48-92% (depending on mask model and tester). For individuals for whom a mask passed testing, 75-100% (average = 86%) also passed testing with a frame holding the mask in place. Among users for whom a mask failed in initial fit testing, 41% passed using a frame. Success varied with mask model and across individuals. Conclusions: The use of mask frames can prolong the lifespan of N95 and KN95 masks by serving as a substitute for broken or defective bands without adversely affecting fit. Frames also have the potential to improve fit for some individuals who cannot fit existing masks. Frames therefore represent a simple and inexpensive way of extending the life and utility of PPE in short supply. For clinicians and institutions interested in mask frames, designs and specifications are provided without restriction for use or modification. To ensure adequate performance in clinical settings, qualitative fit testing with user-specific masks and frames is required.","McAvoy, M.; Bui, A.-T. N.; Hansen, C.; Plana, D.; Said, J.

We tested the hypothesis that meteorological factors (air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall) are independently associated with transmissibility of COVID-19 quantified using the basic reproduction rate (R0). We used publicly available datasets on daily COVID-19 case counts (total n = 108,308), three-hourly meteorological data and community mobility data over a three-month period. Estimated R0 varied between 1.15-1.28. Mean daily air temperature (inversely) and wind speed (positively) were significantly associated with time dependent R0, but the contribution of countrywide lockdown to variability in R0 was over three times stronger as compared to that of temperature and wind speed combined.

225,DYNAMICS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMICS: GLOBAL PATTERN AND BETWEEN COUNTRIES VARIATIONS,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected 203 countries between December 2019 and July 2020. The early epidemic ""wave"" affected countries which now report a few sporadic cases, achieving a stable late phase of the epidemic. Other countries are beginning their epidemic expansion phase. The objective of our study is to characterize the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread. Data science methods were applied to pandemic, focusing on the daily fatality in 24 countries with more than 2,000 deaths, our analysis kin the end retaining 14 countries that have completed a full cycle. The analysis demonstrates a COVID-19 dynamic similar in these studied countries. This 3-phase dynamic is like that of common viral respiratory infections. This pattern, however, shows variability and therefore specificity which the method categorizes into clusters of ""differentiated epidemic patterns"". Among the 5 detected clusters, 2 main ones regroup 11 of these countries, representing 65% of the world deaths (as of June 24, 2020). The pattern seems common to a very large number of countries, and congruent with that of epidemics of other respiratory syndromes, opens the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic would have developed its ""natural history"" by spreading spontaneously despite the measures taken to contain it.

The optimal testing strategy relies on Bayesian experimental design and forecasting epidemic models that account for time dependent interventions. It is applicable at the onset and spreading of the epidemic and can forewarn for a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions.

227,COVID-19 and Rheumatoid Arthritis share myeloid pathogenic and resolving pathways,"BackgroundWe recently delineated the functional biology of pathogenic and inflammation resolving synovial tissue macrophage clusters in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whilst RA is not a viral respiratory syndrome, it represents a pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven chronic articular condition often accompanied by cardiovascular and lung pathologies. We hypothesised that functionally equivalent macrophage clusters in the lung might govern inflammation and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis.

MethodsTo provide insight into the targetable functions of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) macrophage clusters, a comparative analysis of BALF macrophage single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) with synovial tissue (ST) macrophage scRNA-seq and functional biology was performed. The function of shared BALF and ST MerTK inflammation-resolving pathway was confirmed with inhibitor in primary macrophage-synovial fibroblast co-cultures. Results. Distinct BALF FCNpos and FCNposSPP1pos macrophage clusters emerging in severe COVID-19 patients were closely related to ST CD48highS100A12pos and CD48posSPP1pos clusters driving synovitis in active RA. They shared transcriptomic profile and pathogenic mechanisms. Healthy lung resident alveolar FABP4pos macrophages shared a regulatory transcriptomic profile, including TAM (Tyro, Axl, MerTK) receptors pathway with synovial tissue TREM2pos macrophages that govern RA remission. This pathway was substantially altered in BALF macrophages of severe COVID-19. In vitro dexamethasone inhibited tissue inflammation via macrophages MerTK function.

ConclusionPathogenesis and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis and RA synovitis might be driven by similar macrophage clusters and pathways. The MerTK-dependent anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dexamethasone, and the homeostatic function of TAM pathways that maintain RA in remission advocate the therapeutic MerTK agonism to ameliorate the cytokine storm and pneumonitis of severe COVID-19.","MacDonald, L.; Otto, T.

228,High neutralizing potency of swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,"Perfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) has demonstrated a potential to improve the pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2, but procurement and standardization of CP are barriers to its wide usage. Heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin have been used to fight against infectious agents and are a possible alternative to the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 disease. However, heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal alpha1,3-galactose (a-Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and a-Gal epitopes. We also found that these IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses or elicit antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), two drawbacks possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we immunized CMAH/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Animals rapidly developed hyperimmune sera with end-titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end-titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10,000. The IgG fraction purified and formulated following clinical Good Manufacturing Practices, named XAV-19, neutralized Spike/ACE-2 interaction at a concentration < 1microgram/mL and inhibited infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in cytopathic assays. These data and the accumulating safety advantages of using glyco-humanized swine antibodies in humans warrant clinical assessment of XAV-19 to fight against COVID-19.","Vanhove, B.; Duvaux, O.; Rousse, J.; Royer, P.-J.; Evanno, G.; Ciron, C.; Lheriteau, E.; Vacher, L.; Gervois, N.; Oger, R.; Jacques, Y.; Salama, A.; Duchi, R.; Perota, A.; Delahaut, P.; Ledure, M.; Paulus, M.; So, R.; Mok, C.

229,β-Coronaviruses use lysosomal organelles for cellular egress.,"{beta}-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that include the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV2 (SARS-CoV2). While much is known regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, their mode of egress remains uncertain; however, this is assumed to be via the biosynthetic secretory pathway by analogy to other enveloped viruses. Using imaging methodologies in combination with virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that {beta}-Coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress from cells. This pathway is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b; thus, virus egress is insensitive to inhibitors of the biosynthetic secretory pathway. Coronavirus infection results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. This coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomes provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.","Altan-Bonnet, N.; Altan-Bonnet, G.

230,SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV in the requirements for receptor expression and proteolytic activation to trigger cell-cell fusion and is not inhibited by Bromhexine,"The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-S) with the ACE2 receptor and activation by proteases, in particular TMPRSS2. Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We therefore analyzed cell-cell fusion activity of SARS-CoV-2-S with regard to the requirements for ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors and compared it to SARS-CoV-S. We compared S-protein-driven fusion with target cells recombinantly overexpressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. SARS-CoV-2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while the reverse observation was made for SARS-CoV-S. TMPRSS2-mediated effects were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Effector-target-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-2-S was only affected by Camostat when receptor expression was limiting or when the S1/S2 cleavage site was mutated. Mutational ablation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S2' cleavage site abrogated any effects of TMPRSS2 on fusion. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S1/S2 cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting. When both factors were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered, but syncytia remained smaller over time. Overall, its polybasic cleavage site renders SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion less dependent on TMPRSS2 activity on target cells. Unexpectedly, we observed enhancement of SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion by Bromhexine, another TMPRSS2 inhibitor. This effect required intact proteolytic cleavage sites, suggesting interference of Bromhexine with proteolytic priming, but not in a therapeutically desired way. Infection with SARS-CoV-2-S-pseudotyped particles clearly differed in the requirements for proteolytic activation from cell-cell fusion. TMPRSS2 strongly enhanced infection, which was reversed by Camostat but not by Bromhexine.","Hörnich, B. F.; Grosskopf, A. K.; Schlagowski, S.; Tenbusch, M.; Neipel, F.; Hahn, A.

In severe cases, the virus enters the circulatory system, contributing to multiorgan failure. Soluble form of hACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevents viral entry into target cells3. Moreover, soluble recombinant ACE2 ameliorates lung injury4 but its short half-life limits its therapeutic utility5. Here, we engineered synthetic mRNA to encode a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. Novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were used to package mRNA and transfect mammalian cells for enhanced production of secreted proteins. Intravenously administered LNP led to hepatic delivery of the mRNA. This elicited secretion of hsACE2 into the blood circulation within 2 h, and levels of circulating hsACE2 peaked at 6 h and gradually decreased over several days. Since the primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs, we instilled LNPs into the lungs and were able to detect hsACE2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid within 24 h and lasted for 48 h. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we found that mRNA-generated hsACE2 was able to bind with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, hsACE2 was able to strongly inhibit (over 90%) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Our proof of principle study shows that mRNA-based nanotherapeutics can be potentially deployed for pulmonary and extrapulmonary neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and open new treatment opportunities for COVID-19.","Kim, J.; Mukherjee, A.; Nelson, D.; Jozic, A.; Sahay, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.205583v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.205583v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,False
232,"Hospital Trainees Worries, Perceived Sufficiency of Information and Reported Psychological Health During The COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been unsurpassed in clinical severity or infectivity since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and continues to impact the world. During the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, healthcare workers presented frequent concerns regarding their ownand their families health, as well as high levels of psychological distress. Objectives: To assess hospital trainees concerns, perceived sufficiency of information, behaviour and reported psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the NHS Design: Cross-sectional 39-point questionnaire study conducted in May 2020 Setting: A large NHS foundation trust in London Participants: 204 hospital trainee doctors Outcome measures: Quantitative analysis of trainees worries and concerns while working during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed across 8 domains: trainee demographics; concerns and worries regarding COVID-19; perceived sufficiency of information about the COVID-19 pandemic; social distancing; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and training in PPE; COVID-19 acquisition and risk; reported psychological health; and medical education. Results: 91.7% looked after COVID-19 patients. 91.6% were worried about COVID-19; the most frequent concern was that of family and friends dying from COVID-19 (74.6%). 22.2% reported being infected with COVID-19. 6.8% of trainees were so concerned about COVID-19 infection that they would avoid going to work. Perceived sufficiency of information about COVID-19 was moderately high. 25.9% reported that they were able to socially distance at work compared to 94.4% able to socially distance outside work. 98.2% reported using PPE and 24.7% were confident the provided PPE protected them against infection with COVID-19. 41.9% reported that their psychological health had been affected by their work with the commonest being anxiety (56.6%), emotional distress (50.9%) and burnout (37.7%). 95.6% felt it is important to have a service that provides psychological support during this pandemic and 62.5% reported they would consider using this at work. Conclusions: A significant proportion of hospital trainees are worried about the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of reported psychological distress. Given that almost a third would not use psychological support services at work, hospital leaders and liaison psychiatry need to explore the reasons for not wanting to use services at work and highlight the provision of psychological services provided outside work such that provided by the London deaneries professional support unit (PSU). Seeking solutions to support trainee wellbeing in addition to this, such as larger offices, adequate rest facilities and alternative methods of teaching, with their input would enable empowerment of trainees and improve their health and morale while working in a pandemic.","Aziminia, N.; Khani, A.; Smith, C.; Bakhai, A.; Lisk, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20158311v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20158311v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
233,High Rate of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission due to Choir Practice in France at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: There has been very little focus on the individual risk of acquiring COVID-19 related to choir practice. Methods: We report the case of a high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 linked to an indoor choir rehearsal in France in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 27 participants, including 25 male singers, a conductor and an accompanist attended a choir practice on March 12, 2020. The practice was indoor and took place in a non-ventilated space of 45 m2. The mean age of the participants was 66.9 (range 35-86) years. 70% of the participants (19 of 27) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from 1 to 12 days after the rehearsal with a median of 5.1 days. 36% of the cases needed a hospitalization (7/19), and 21% (4/19) were admitted to an ICU. The index cases were possibly multiple. Discussion: The choir practice was planned in March 2020 at a period when the number of new cases of COVID-19 began to grow exponentially in France because SARS-CoV-2 was actively circulating. The secondary rate attack (70%) was much higher than it is described within households (10-20%) and among close contacts made outside households (0-5%). Singing might have contributed to enhance SARS-CoV-2 person-to-person transmission through emission of droplets and aerosolization in a closed non ventilated space with a relative high number of individuals. Conclusions: Indoor choir practice should be suspended during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Further studies are necessary to test the spread of the virus by the act of singing. As the benefits of the barrier measures and social distancing are known to be effective in terms of a reduction in the incidence of the COVID-19, experts recommendations concerning the resuming of choir practice are necessary.","CHARLOTTE, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20145326v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20145326v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
234,TESTING INFORMED SIR BASED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL FOR COVID-19 IN LUXEMBOURG,"The interpretation of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in a country or region is strongly dependent on the number of performed tests. We developed a novel SIR based epidemiological model (SIVRT) which allows the country-specific integration of testing information and other available data. The model thereby enables a dynamic inspection of the pandemic and allows estimating key figures, like the number of overall detected and undetected COVID-19 cases and the infection fatality rate. As proof of concept, the novel SIVRT model was used to simulate the first phase of the pandemic in Luxembourg. An overall number of infections of 13.000 and an infection fatality rate of 1,3% was estimated, which is in concordance with data from population-wide testing. Furthermore based on the data as of end of May 2020 and assuming a partial deconfinement, an increase of cases is predicted from mid of July 2020 on. This is consistent with the current observed rise and shows the predictive potential of the novel SIVRT model.","Sauter, T.; Pires Pacheco, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159046v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159046v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
235,Paired nasopharyngeal and deep lung testing for SARS-CoV2 reveals a viral gradient in critically ill patients: a multi-centre study,"Introduction Samples for diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained from the upper (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs) or lower respiratory tract (sputum or tracheal aspirate or broncho-alveolar lavage - BAL). Data from different testing sites indicates different rates of positivity. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows for semi-quantitative estimates of viral load as time to crossing threshold (Ct) is inversely related to viral load. Objectives The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV2 RNA loads between paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and deep lung (endotracheal aspirate or BAL) samples from critically ill patients. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results were retrospectively reviewed for 51 critically ill patients from 5 intensive care units in 3 hospitals ; Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge (3 units), Royal Papworth Cambridge (1 unit), and Royal Sunderland Hospital (1 unit). At the times when paired NP and deep lung samples were obtained, one patient had been on oxygen only, 6 patients on non-invasive ventilation, 18 patients on ECMO, and 26 patients mechanically ventilated. Results Results collected showed significant gradient between NP and deep lung viral loads. Median Ct value was 29 for NP samples and 24 for deep lung samples. Of 51 paired samples, 16 were negative (below limit of detection) on NP swabs but positive (above limit of detection) on deep lung sample, whilst 2 were negative on deep sample but positive on NP (both patients were on ECMO). Conclusions It has been suggested that whilst SARS-CoV1 tends to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV2 replicates more vigorously in the upper respiratory tract. These data challenge that assumption. These data suggest that viral migration to, and proliferation in, the lower respiratory tract may be a key factor in the progression to critical illness and the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Factors which promote this migration should be examined for association with severe COVID-19. From a practical point of view, patients with suspected severe COVID-19 should have virological samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract where-ever possible, as upper respiratory samples have a significant negative rate.","Hamed, I.; Shaban, N.; Nassar, M.; Love, S.; Curran, M.

236,ISARIC COVID-19 Clinical Data Report: 8 June 2020,"ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 8 June 2020. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support. As of 8JUN20, data have been entered for 67,130 patients from 488 sites across 37 countries. For this report, we show data for 42,656 patients with confirmed disease who were enrolled >14 days prior. This update includes about 2,400 new cases from France, and we thank these collaborators for this significant addition to the dataset. Some highlights from this report The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission is 5 days, but a proportion of patients take longer to get to the hospital (average 14.6 days, standard deviation 8.1). COVID-19 patients tend to require prolonged hospitalisation; of the 88% with a known outcome, the median length of admission to death or discharge is 8 days and the mean 11.5. 17% of patients were admitted to ICU/HDU, about 40% of these on the very day of hospital admission. Antibiotics were given to 83% of patients, antivirals to 9%, steroids to 15%, which becomes 93%, 50% and 27%, respectively for those admitted to ICU/HDU. Attention has been called on overuse of antibiotics and need to adhere to antibiotic stewardship principles. 67% of patients received some degree of oxygen supplementation: of these 23.4% received NIV and 15% IMV. This relatively high proportion of oxygen use will have implications for oxygen surge planning in healthcare facilities. Some centres may need to plan to boost capacity to deliver oxygen therapy if this is not readily available.

237,Stringent thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays result in under-detection of cases reporting loss of taste/smell,"Thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays have typically been determined using samples from symptomatic, often hospitalised, patients. Assay performance following mild/asymptomatic infection is unclear. We assessed IgG responses in asymptomatic healthcare workers with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, e.g. 807/9292(8.9%) reported loss of smell/taste. The proportion reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody titres below diagnostic thresholds for both an in-house ELISA and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA): 424/903(47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/387(13.2%) with high-negative titres, and 324/7943(4.1%) with low-negative results. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 90.8% (95%CI 86.1-92.1%) and Abbott CMIA 80.9% (77.5-84.3%). However, the sensitivity may be lower if some anosmia/ageusia in those with low-negative titres is Covid-19-associated. Samples from individuals with mild/asymptomatic infection should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations. Reporting equivocal SARS-CoV-2 antibody results should be considered.","Eyre, D.

238,Impact of Restrictions on Parental Presence in Neonatal Intensive Care Units Related to COVID-19,"Objectives: To determine the relationship between the emergence of COVID-19 and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) family presence as well as how NICU design affects these changes. Study Design: A cross-sectional survey from April 21 to 30, 2020. We queried sites regarding NICU demographics, NICU restrictions on parental presence, and changes in ancillary staff availability. Results: Globally, 277 facilities responded to the survey. NICU policies preserving 24/7 parental presence decreased (83% to 53%, p<0.001) and of preserving full parental participation in rounds fell (71% to 32%, p<0.001). Single family room design NICUs best preserved 24/7 parental presence after the emergence of COVID-19 (single family room 65%, hybrid-design 57%, open bay design 45%, p=.018). In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in therapy services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support. Conclusions: Hospital restrictions have significantly limited parental presence for NICU admitted infants, although single family room design may attenuate this effect.","Darcey-Mahoney, A.; White, R.

239,An Analysis of Outbreak Dynamics and Intervention Effects for COVID-19 Transmission in Europe,"As of March 13, 2020, Europe became the center of COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prevent further spread and slow down the increase in confirmed cases and deaths, many countries in European Union have taken some interventions since mid-March. In this study, a metapopulation model was used to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe and the effectiveness of these interventions were also estimated. The findings suggested that many countries successfully kept the reproduction number R_t less than 1 (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, and France) while other countries exhibited R_t greater than 1 (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus). Based on the assumed reopen strategy, this study also revealed that a 2-week delay in response predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak value), while a 3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily peak value). Therefore, a quick response upon signs of a re-emerging pandemic in the world is highly imperative to mitigate potential loss of life and to keep transmission of Covid-19 under control.","Wang, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158873v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158873v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
240,SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in health care workers: Preliminary report of a single center study,"SARS-CoV-2 has driven a pandemic crisis. Serological surveys have been conducted to establish prevalence for covid-19 antibody in various cohorts and communities. However, the prevalence among healthcare workers is still being analyzed. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study participants were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job title, location, covid-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with covid-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 3,013 tested individuals, a total 2,932 were included in the analysis due to some missing data. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001) and loss of smell (p < .001). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, possible greater presence of cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity in healthcare workers vs. the general population may have contributed. Determining antibody prevalence in front-line workers, and duration of antibody presence may help stratify the workforce for risk, establish better health place policies and procedures, and potentially better mitigate transmission.","Brant-Zawadzki, M.; Fridman, D.; Robinson, P.; Zahn, M.; German, R.; Breit, M.; Hara, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158329v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158329v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
241,COVIDCare@Home: Lessons from a Family Medicine Led Remote Monitoring Program,"Background: Virtual care for patients with COVID-19 allows providers to monitor COVID-19 positive patients with variable trajectories while reducing the risk of transmission to others and managing healthcare capacity in acute care facilities. Objective: To develop and test the feasibility of a family medicine-led remote monitoring model of care (COVIDCare@Home program) to manage patients with COVID-19 in the community. Methods: This multi-faceted, family medicine-led, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program was developed at Womens College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. A cross-sectional chart review of the first cohort of patients was conducted and learnings from the implementation of CovidCare@Home are described. Results: During the study period, April 8 to May 11, 2020, there were 97 patients (average age 48.6, 62% female) with 424 recorded virtual visits with a median virtual length of stay of 8 days (IQR 5). 5.2% required escalation to an in-person visit with no patients requiring hospitalization. 16% of patients required support with mental and social health needs. Interpretations: A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely be used to manage outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Attention to mental and social health needs is critical for this population. Future efforts should consider how to design programs to best support populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, something which primary care is well-positioned to do. Further analysis will describe the effectiveness, impact, and satisfaction with the program among patients and providers.","Agarwal, P.; Mukerji, G.; Laur, C.; Chandra, S.; Pimlott, N.; Heisey, R.; Stovel, R.; Goulbourne, E.; Bhatia, S.; Bhattacharyya, O.; Martin, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158386v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158386v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
242,Linking Outdoor Air Temperature and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in the US Using a Two Parameter Transmission Model,"Outdoor temperature lower than 50F and greater than 70F is shown to nearly double the transmission efficiency of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Outdoor temperature is an important factor behind the current surge in US Covid-19 cases. Correlation of northern state infection data and outdoor temperatures is used to identify the change in disease transmission efficiency as northern states passed through the lower temperature bound (50F) in spring, and more recently transitioned to temperatures above the higher bound (70F). At current disease transmission efficiency levels, social distancing must be increased above a UMD Social Distance Index (SDI) level of 36 to stop the accelerated increase of daily infection cases. At current disease transmission efficiency (G=0.19) and SDI of 33, the US will approach 150,000 infections per day in September before declining as average US temperature falls below 70F. A primary reason for enhanced disease transmission below 50F and above 70F is attributed to inadequate indoor ventilation. Swing season occurs when outdoor temperatures are between 50F and 70F, and is the time of year when homes and buildings are opened to the outdoors. Increased fresh air ventilation (greater than 40cfm per person), improved air filtration (MERV11 and greater filters), and UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, 0.02WUV per cfm airflow) coupled with wearing face masks, 6ft distancing and surface sanitation are estimated to reduce indoor disease transmission probability to a third of the transmission probability resulting from standard building ventilation practice.","Newell, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158238v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158238v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
243,"Anatomy of digital contact tracing: role of age, transmission setting, adoption and case detection","The efficacy of digital contact tracing against COVID-19 epidemic is debated: smartphone penetration is limited in many countries, non-uniform across age groups, with low coverage among elderly, the most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. We developed an agent-based model to precise the impact of digital contact tracing and household isolation on COVID-19 transmission. The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact-survey and epidemiological information to describe the risk factors for exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio R=2.6 and 50% detection of clinical cases, a ~20% app adoption reduces peak incidence of ~36%. With R=1.7, >30% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels. Higher coverage among adults, playing a central role in COVID-19 transmission, yields an indirect benefit for elderly. These results may inform the inclusion of digital contact tracing within a COVID-19 response plan.","Moreno Lopez, J.

245,Prevalence of mask wearing in northern Vermont in response to SARS-CoV-2,"Mask wearing is integral to reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Information on prevalence of face mask usage is required both to model disease spread and to improve compliance with mask usage through targeted messaging. We sought to (1) estimate the prevalence of mask usage in the most populous county of Vermont (Chittenden County;>25% of state population) and to (2) assess the effect of age and sex on mask use. We monitored the entrances to eight different business types and visually assessed individuals' age, gender, and mask use from a distance. We collected 1004 observations from 16 May through 30 May 2020 as businesses began to reopen following an extended state-wide lock down. We analyzed these data using a Bayesian random effects logistic regression model. We found that overall 75.5% of individuals used a mask with significant effects of age and gender on mask usage. Females were more likely to wear masks than males (83.8%, n=488 vs. 67.6%, n=516 mask usage, respectively); the odds of a male wearing a mask was 53% that of the female odds. Across age groups, the elderly were most likely to wear a mask (91.4%, n=209) followed by young adults (74.8%, n=246), middle-aged adults (70.7%, n=519) and children (53.3%, n=30). The odds of an elderly person wearing a mask were 16.7 times that of a child, while the odds for young adults and middle-aged adults were {approx}3 times greater than a child. Highest mask usage was in elder females (96.3%, n=109) and lowest mask usage was in male children (43.8%, n=16).","Beckage, B.; Buckley, T.; Beckage, M.

246,Local public health officials and COVID-19: Evidence from China,"Understanding what contributes to the slowing down of COVID-19 in China is essential for other governments to better deal with the pandemic. Similar to their counterparts in the U.S. and the U.K., local public health authorities in China are responsible for monitoring infectious diseases and organizing the responses to public health emergencies. However they are not typically viewed as essential as China policymakers focus on economic growth. Only 38% of the heads of the public health departments of Chinese cities have a medical background. We find that cities with medical professionals as the head of public health departments had lower infection rates and death rates from COVID-19. The results were significant only at the start of the outbreak. Our results suggest to better combat a pandemic, local public health authorities should be led by competent people who have a medical background.","Jiang, J.; Wang, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156828v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.20156828v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
247,Projecting contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: an update and comparison with empirical data for the COVID-19 era,"Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices reproduce the main traits of the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.","Prem, K.; van Zandvoort, K.; Klepac, P.; Eggo, R.

248,The Epidemiology Workbench: a Tool for Communities to Strategize in Response to COVID-19 and other Infectious Diseases,"COVID-19 poses a dramatic challenge to health, community life, and the economy of communities across the world. While the properties of the virus are similar from place to place, the impact has been dramatically different from place to place, due to such factors as population density, mobility, age distribution, etc. Thus, optimum testing and social distancing strategies may also be different from place to place. The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which demographic, geographic, and public health information a community together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our calculations suggest that massive testing is the most effective strategy to combat the likely increase in local cases due to mass ingress of a student population carrying a higher viral load than that currently present in the community.","Nunez-Corrales, S.; Jakobsson, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159798v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159798v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
249,Estimating Variation of Covid-19 infection in the Population:Results from Understanding Society (UKHLS) first monthly covid-19 survey,"The analysis in this paper uses the new Understanding Society COVID-19 survey. The key advantage of these data is that they allow us to examine infection rates for people with particular characteristics. We study how reported symptoms vary in the population and relate reported symptoms to a positive Covid-19 test in the small sample in the survey who were tested. Combining these probabilities we find that the chances of infection increase with a persons education level, are lower and declining with age among those aged over 55, and were higher in the West Midlands and London and lower in the North East than in the rest of the country, and tended to increase with regional population density. There is also evidence that the infection rate was lower among those of a Caribbean origin. A suitably cautious estimate of the mean infection rate is that, during the period up to the end of April 2020, it was between 2% and 8%, with a central rate of about 5%.","Breen, R.; Ermisch, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159806v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159806v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
250,EPICOVID19: Psychometric assessment and validation of a short diagnostic scale for a rapid Covid-19 screening based on reported symptoms,"Background Confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in 213 countries and regions and as of 12 July 2020, over 12 million cases, with 561617 deaths have been reported worldwide. The number of cases changes quickly and varies depending upon which source you use to track, so in the current epidemiological context, the early recognition is critical for the rapid identification of suspected cases (with SARS-CoV-2 infection-like symptoms and signs) to be immediately subjected to quarantine measures. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population so far. Methods Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 national survey, launched in April 2020 including a national convenience sample of 201121 adults, who voluntarily filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The phase II questionnaire was mailed to all subjects who underwent tests for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and who accepted to be involved in the second phase of the study, focused on the results reported for NPS and/or serological IgG/IgM tests. We evaluated the capability of the self-reported symptoms collected through the EPICOVID19 questionnaire to discriminate the COVID-19 among symptomatic subjects, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements and clinical examinations. We defined a method for the identification of a total score and validated it with reference to the serological and molecular clinical diagnosis, using four standard steps: identification of critical factors, confirmation of presence of latent variable, development of optimal scoring algorithm and validation of the scoring algorithm. Findings 2703 subjects [66% response rate] completed the Phase II questionnaire. Of 2703 individuals, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+) and of these 84 (12.1% of the 694 NPS(+)) were asymptomatic. In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did IgG(+) and 421 who did IgM(+), 22.9% and 11.6% tested positive, respectively. Among IgG(+) 1 of 108 subjects was asymptomatic (0.9%) while 5/49 subjects among IgM(+) were asymptomatic (10.2%). Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; p<0.0001), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; p<0.0001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9% ]; p<0.0001). Also for other symptoms the frequencies were significantly higher in NPS(+) subjects than in NPS(-) ones (p<0.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8% ]; p<0.0001) and Pain in muscles, bones, joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5% ]; p<0.0001). For the COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items, exploratory (proportion variance explained [89.9%]) and confirmatory factor analysis results (SMSR 0.072; RMSEA 0.052) highlights the presence of one latent variable (factor) underlying the symptoms. We define the one-factor solution as EPICOVID19 diagnostic scale and optimal score for each items was identified: Respiratory problems (1.03), Chest pain (1.07), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (0.97) and Tachycardia (palpitations) (1.05) were the most important symptoms. The cut-off score was 2.56 (Sensitivity 76.56%; Specificity 68.24%) in NPS(+) and 2.59 (Se 80.37; Sp 80.17) in IgG(+) subjects.","Bastiani, L.; Fortunato, L.; Pieroni, S.; Bianchi, F.; Adorni, F.; Prinelli, F.; Giacomelli, A.; Pagani, G.; Maggi, S.; Trevisan, C.; Noale, M.; Jesuthasan, N.; Sojic, A.; Pettenati, C.; Andreoni, M.; Antonelli Incalzi, R.; Galli, M.; Molinaro, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159590v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159590v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
251,The role of mathematical model in curbing COVID-19 in Nigeria,"The role of mathematical models in controlling infectious diseases cannot be overemphasized. COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity( R_0<1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50%[&le;]<70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5[&le;]{sigma}_2<0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ([&ge;]70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ({sigma}_2=0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","Madubueze, C.

252,Effect of manual and digital contact tracing on COVID-19 outbreaks: a study on empirical contact data,"In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have succeeded in limiting contagions in many countries, at however heavy societal costs: more targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions are desirable to contain or mitigate potential resurgences. Contact tracing, by identifying and quarantining people who have been in prolonged contact with an infectious individual, has the potential to stop the spread where and when it occurs, with thus limited impact. The limitations of manual contact tracing (MCT), due to delays and imperfect recall of contacts, might be compensated by digital contact tracing (DCT) based on smartphone apps, whose impact however depends on the app adoption. To assess the efficiency of such interventions in realistic settings, we use here datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts, with high spatial and temporal resolution, to feed numerical simulations of a compartmental model for COVID-19. We find that the obtained reduction of epidemic size has a robust behavior: this benefit is linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT, and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The combination of tracing strategies can yield important benefits, and the cost (number of quarantines) vs. benefit curve has a typical parabolic shape, independent on the type of tracing, with a high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Our numerical results are qualitatively confirmed by analytical results on simplified models. These results may inform the inclusion of MCT and DCT within COVID-19 response plans.","Barrat, A.; Cattuto, C.; Kivelä, M.; Lehmann, S.; Saramäki, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20159947v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20159947v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
253,Alternative Approaches for Modelling COVID-19:High-Accuracy Low-Data Predictions,"Background: Numerous models have tried to predict the spread of COVID-19. Many involve myriad assumptions and parameters which cannot be reliably calculated under current conditions. We describe machine-learning and curve-fitting based models using fewer assumptions and readily available data. Methods: Instead of relying on highly parameterized models, we design and train multiple neural networks with data on a national and state level, from 9 COVID-19 affected countries, including Indian and US states and territories. Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions. Findings: We achieve an R2 of 0.999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographically- and demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99.53% for 14 days of forecast and 99.1% for 24 days of forecast. Interpretation: We have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% - almost a fourth of the world average of 9%.","Agarwal, D.

254,Similarities between the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and Functional Neurological Disorder: A systematic overview of systematic reviews and implications for future neurological healthcare services,"Background COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, spread rapidly across the world from December 2019. While the main symptoms of the disease are respiratory, extensive research has realised evidence of a variety of neurological symptoms, both catastrophic such as cerebrovascular disease and benign such as hyposmia (loss of smell). Aim To provide health professionals with better accessibility to available evidence, this paper summarises findings from a systematic overview of systematic reviews of the neurological symptoms seen in patients with COVID-19. Similarities between the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) were explored and the impact of this on neurological services and health professionals' perceptions towards FND. Methods This research was completed in three phases: phase one, a systematic overview of current reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 was conducted; phase two, the most common symptoms of FND defined within key sources were collated; phase three, the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and those of FND were compared. Results Fourteen systematic reviews were identified within seven databases, published between 1st December 2019 and 15th June 2020. The results indicated (so far), that when compared, COVID-19 and FND exhibit many similar neurological symptoms. Conclusions This led to a consideration of the implications for neurological healthcare services in the UK, and the possible change-effect on perceptions of FND. Implications may include longer waiting times and a need for more resources (including more qualified health professionals). Future research is required to explore how health professionals' perceptions of neurological symptoms may change because of COVID-19.","Wildwing, T.; Holt, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158816v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20158816v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
255,Coronavirus-related online web search desire amidst the rising novel coronavirus incidence in Ethiopia: Google Trends-based infodemiology,"Abstract Background: During outbreaks, like novel coronavirus (COVID 19) disease pandemic, social communication and behaviors are very important. Under such circumstances, individual activities in social media and other online platforms will increase tremendously resulting in the circulation of information in the community. These pieces of information can be infodemic monikers misleading the community. Thus exploring the trends of public interest in searching COVID 19 related issues and checking information circulating in the public is highly crucial. Objective: This study aimed to explore users' concerns towards coronavirus related online web search and to investigate the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) adopted for identifying the virus in the early stage of COVID 19 spread in Ethiopia. Methods: Google Trends was employed in exploring the tendency towards coronavirus related web search activities in Ethiopia from March 13 to May 8, 2020. Keywords of the different names of COVID 19 and health related issues were used to investigate the trends of public interest in searching from Google over time. Relative search volume (RSV), Average peak comparison (APC), and associated graphs were used to compare the trends of online search interests. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to check for the presence of correlation. Result: During the study period, the top names users adopted to identify the virus in Ethiopia were corona, virus, coronavirus, corona virus, China coronavirus, and COVID 19. In almost all search activities, the users employed infodemic monikers to identify the virus (overall relative search percentage of 99%). Updates related issues (APC=60, 95% CI, 55, 66) were the most commonly trending health related searches on Google followed by mortality (APC=27, 95% CI, 24, 30) and symptoms (APC=55, 95% CI, 50, 60) related issues. The regional comparison showed the highest cumulative peak for the Oromia region (cumulative total RSVs, 536) followed by the Tigray region (cumulative total RSVs, 512) on querying health related information from Google. No significant correlation was detected between COVID 19 cases per region/city and the maximum peaks of health related searches. Conclusion: This study revealed an initial increase in the public interest of COVID 19 related Google search, but this interest was declined over time. Tremendous circulation of infodemic monikers for the identification of the virus was also noticed in the country. The authors recommend for the government and other stakeholders to work immensely to keep the people alert on coronavirus-related issues and to promote the official names of the virus, like COVID 19, SARS CoV 2 in the public to decrease the circulation of misleading and misinformation amid the outbreak.

256,LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN MEXICAN PATIENTS WITH SARS COV2 INFECTION,"In late December 2019, a new disease reported at the time by an unknown pathogen was reported, which was later found to be a new variant of coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV2. This new disease had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition. In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resource-limited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Paredes, L.

In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index.","Abbey, E.

258,"Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: an ecological study","Objective: To determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions and COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality.","Rodriguez-Villamizar, L. A.; Belalcazar-Ceron, L. C.; Fernandez-Nino, J.

260,Weak association of coinfection by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses with severe cases and death,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus described for the first time in China in December 2019. This virus can cause a disease that ranges in spectrum from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease with multiorgan failure, and the most severe cases are associated with some comorbidities and patient age. However, there are patients who do not have those risk factors who still develop serious disease. In this study, we identified the presence of other respiratory viruses in positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico to determine if any coinfections were correlated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. We analysed 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using RT-qPCR for the detection of 16 other respiratory viruses.Of the cases analysed, 14 (13.6%) were cases of coinfection, and 92% of them never required hospitalization, even when comorbidities and advanced age were involved. There were not significant differences between the presence of comorbidities and the mean ages of the groups. These results suggest that coinfection is not related to more severe COVID-19 and that, depending on the virus involved, it could even lead to a better prognosis. We believe that our findings may lay the groundwork for new studies aimed at determining the biological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs and for proposing corresponding strategies to limit the progression to severe cases of COVID-19.","Fernandes-Matano, L.; Monroy-Munoz, I.

261,Evaluating temperature and humidity gradients of COVID-19 infection rates in light of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions,"We evaluate potential temperature and humidity impact on the infection rate of COVID-19 with a data up to June 10th 2020, which comprises a large geographical footprint. It is critical to analyse data from different countries or regions at similar stages of the pandemic in order to avoid picking up false gradients. The degree of severity of NPIs is found to be a good gauge of the stage of the pandemic for individual countries. Data points are classified according to the stringency index of the NPIs in order to ensure that comparisons between countries are made on equal footing. We find that temperature and relative humidity gradients do not significantly deviate from the zero-gradient hypothesis. Upper limits on the absolute value of the gradients are set. The procedure chosen here yields 6{middle dot}10^-3{degrees}C^-1 and 3.3{middle dot}10^-3(%)^-1 upper limits on the absolute values of the temperature and relative humidity gradients, respectively, with a 95% Confidence Level. These findings do not preclude existence of seasonal effects and are indicative that these are likely to be nuanced.","Choma, J.; Mellado, B.; Lieberman, B.; Correa, F.; Maslo, C.; Naude, J.; Ruan, X.; Hayashi, K.; Monnakgotla, K.; Dahbi, S.-E.; Stevenson, F.

262,Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 with Waning Immunity in the UK Population,"The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While the duration and strength of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, specific antibody titres to related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to wane in recovered individuals, and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore different potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) after lockdown is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 409,000 infectious individuals; almost three-fold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary peak. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection if immunity to re-infection is not permanent.","Crellen, T.; Pi, L.; Davis, E.; Pollington, T.

263,A vulnerability analysis for the management of and response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the second most populous state in Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to affect all individuals, however in a heterogeneous way. In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of the 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. Then, an epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature review and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte mesoregion is the most vulnerable, with 42.9% and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.","Campos, I.

264,Confirmed and Unreported COVID-19 Death Counts: An Assessment of Reporting Discrepancy,"Objective: We aim to assess the reporting discrepancy and the difference between confirmed and unreported COVID-19-like death counts. Study Design: The study is based on time-series data. Methods: We used publicly available data to explore the differences between confirmed death counts and deaths with Codiv-19 symptoms between March 8, 2020, and July 11, 2020, in Bangladesh. Results: During the week ending May 9, 2020, the unreported COVID-19-like death count was higher than the confirmed COVID-19 death count; however, it was lower in the following weeks. On average, unreported COVID-19-like death counts were similar to the confirmed COVID-19 death counts during the same period. However, the reporting authority neither considers these deaths nor adjusts for potential seasonal influenza or other related deaths, which might produce incomplete COVID-19 data and respective mortality rates. Conclusions: Documenting unreported deaths with COVID-19 symptoms needs to be included in provisional death counts because it is essential to estimate a robust COVID-19 mortality rate and to offer data-driven pandemic response strategies. An urgent initiative is needed to prepare an acceptable guideline for COVID-19 death reporting.","Ahamad, M.

265,Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) Significantly Reduces Respiratory Morbidity in COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Prospective Randomized Trial,"Background. Interventions mitigating progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 would markedly improve outcome and reduce healthcare utilization. We hypothesized that immunomodulation with IVIG would improve oxygenation and reduce length of hospital stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods. Patients with COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.5 g/kg/day x 3 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion versus SOC alone. Results. 16 subjects received IVIG plus SOC and 17 SOC alone. The median age was 51 years for SOC and 58 years for IVIG. APACHE II scores and Charlson comorbidity indices were similar for IVIG and SOC (median 7.5 vs 7 and 2 for both, respectively). Seven SOC versus 2 IVIG subjects required mechanical ventilation (p=0.12, Fisher exact test). Among subjects with A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg at enrollment, the IVIG group showed i) a lower rate of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (2/14 vs 7/12, p=0.038 Fisher exact test), ii) shorter median hospital length of stay (11 vs 19 days, p=0.01 Mann Whitney U), iii) shorter median ICU stay (2.5 vs 12.5 days, p=0.006 Mann Whitey U), and iv) greater improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days (median [range] change from time of enrollment +131 [+35 to +330] vs +44.5 [-115 to +157], p=0.01, Mann Whitney-U test) than SOC.

266,"Clustering, diffusion and evolution of COVID19 infections during lock-down","Epidemics such as the spreading of COVID19-virus are highly non linear, and therefore difficult to predict. In the present pandemy as time evolves, it appears more and more clearly that a clustered dynamics is a key element of description. This means that the disease rapidly evolves within spatially localized networks, that diffuse and eventually create new clusters. We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. The so-obtained SBIR model compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic, is observed to be very similar for countries in which a strict lock-down is applied. We derive an analytical expression for the value of this exponent, relating it to the initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic and to the time-scale of cluster-diffusion.","Bos, W.; Bertoglio, J.-P.; Gostiaux, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159830v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159830v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
267,A data-driven metapopulation model for the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic: assessing the impact of lockdown and exit strategies,"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several countries adopted measures of social distancing to a different degree. For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks. We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and serological data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown. Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period. Community contacts are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19. Regular re-assessment is crucial to adjust to evolving behavioral changes that can affect epidemic diffusion. In addition to social distancing, sufficient capacity for extensive testing and contact tracing is essential for successful mitigation.","Coletti, P.; Libin, P.; Petrof, O.; Willem, L.; Steven, A.; Herzog, S.

268,Factors Associated with COVID-19 Mitigation Behavior among US Adults,"In January 2020, the US declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency and subsequently the CDC issued guidelines for personal mitigation behavior, such as mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social-distancing. We examine individual socio-economic factors that potentially predict mitigation compliance using public data. We hypothesize that health risk factors, presence of symptoms, and psychological wellbeing predict mitigation behavior. Understanding what factors are associated with mitigation behavior will be important for policy makers in their efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic prompted strong mitigation behavior by adults, especially among females, non-whites, urban dwellers, and the psychological unwell. Other positive predictors were post-secondary education and higher income. Health symptoms and clinical risk factors did not predict increased mitigation practices, nor did age 65+ and proximity to infected persons. Our study findings are congruent with a report that pointed to a lack of increased pandemic mitigation practices in households with confirmed infections and health risks. Our results also point to lower levels of psychological resilience, lower socio-economic status, and non-urban location as potential explanatory factors for lack of mitigation behavior.","Lemke, D.; Lemke, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20157925v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.20157925v1?rss=1,2020-07-25,2020-07-25,,True
269,Hospital-Based Donor Recruitment and Pre-Donation Serologic Testing for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma,"Background: Major blood centers perform serologic testing on potential COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors retrospectively after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors may be an efficient way to prospectively identify potential donors. Study Design and Methods: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire (DHQ), and if eligible, were consented and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred to a local blood center for convalescent plasma collection. Results: Of 179 individuals screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for convalescent plasma donation to a local blood center (49.7% of those screened). IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23/51 (45.1%) of participants with suspected COVID-19 and in 66/77 (85.7%) of participants with self-reported PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Testing was performed at a median of 38 days since last symptoms. Participant age positively correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels. Time since last symptoms did not correlate with IgG or IgM levels. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed.

270,Time is of the essence: containment of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland from February to May 2020,"AIM: In late February and early March 2020, Switzerland experienced rapid growth of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections with 30,243 confirmed cases and 1,860 deaths as of 10 May 2020. The sequential introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) resulted in successful containment of the epidemic. A better understanding of how the timing of implementing NPIs influences the dynamics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics will be crucial for the management of a potential resurgence in Switzerland. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model that describes infection, hospitalization, recovery and death due to SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland. Using a maximum likelihood framework, we fitted the model to aggregated daily numbers of hospitalized patients, ICU occupancy and death from 25 February to 10 May 2020. We estimated critical parameters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and explored counterfactual scenarios of an earlier and later implementation of NPIs. RESULTS: We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.61 (95% compatibility interval, CI: 2.51-2.71) during the early exponential phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland. After the implementation of NPIs, the effective reproduction number approached Re = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61-0.66). Based on the observed doubling times of the epidemic before and after the implementation of NPIs, we estimated that one week of early exponential spread required 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.8-3.3 weeks) of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of infections to the same level. Introducing the same sequence of NPIs one week earlier or later would have resulted in substantially lower (399, 95% prediction interval, PI: 347-458) and higher (8,683, 95% PI: 8,038-9,453) numbers of deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of NPIs in March 2020 prevented thousands of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in Switzerland. Early implementation of NPIs during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can reduce the number of deaths and the necessary duration of strict control measures considerably.","Althaus, C.

271,"Threshold analyses on rates of testing, transmission, and contact for COVID-19 control in a university setting","We simulated epidemic projections of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a university population of 38,000 persons, under varying combinations of mass test rate (0% to 10%), contact trace and test rate (0% to 50%), transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact per day), and contact rate (number of contacts per person per day). We simulated four levels of transmission rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing), and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths. When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8. However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths. Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3, the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of 10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 10. However, keeping contact rate to 4 or below was more robust to delays in testing, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 6 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For contact rate of 4, the number of trace and tests peaked at 50 per day and relaxed to 10 per day with the addition of 10% mass test. Threshold estimates can help develop on-campus scheduling and indoor-spacing plans in conjunction with plans for asymptomatic testing for COVID-19.

274,Mathematical model study of a pandemic: Graded lockdown approach,"A kinetic approach is developed, in a ""tutorial style"" to describe the evolution of an epidemic with spread taking place through contact. The ""infection-rate"" is calculated from the rate at which an infected person approaches an uninfected susceptible individual, i.e. a potential recipient of the disease, up to a distance p, where the value of p may lie between pmin[&le;]p[&le;]pmax. We consider a situation with a total population of N individuals, living in an area A, x(t) amongst them being infected while xd(t) = {beta}'x(t) is the number that has died in the course of transmission and evolution of the epidemic. The evolution is developed under the conditions (1) a faction (t) of the [N-x(t)-xd(t)] uninfected individuals and (2) a {beta}(t) fraction of the x(t) infected population are quarantined, while the ""source-events"" that spread the infection are considered to occur with frequency {upsilon}. The processes of contact and transmission are considered to be Markovian. Transmission is assumed to be inhibited by several processes like the use of ""masks"", ""hand washing or use of sanitizers"" while ""physical distancing"" is described by p.

The growth is predicted for several BBMP wards in Bengaluru and in urban centers in Chikkaballapur district, as an illustrative case. The above selections serve as model cases for high, moderate and thin population densities. It is seen that the evolution of [x(t)/N] with time depends upon (a) the initial time scale of evolution, (b) the time scale of cure and (c) on the time dependence of the Lockdown function Q(t) = {[1-(t)]{middle dot}[1-{beta}(t)]}. The formulae are amenable to simple computations and show that in order to curb the spread one must ensure that Q({infty}) must be below a critical value and the vigilance has to be continued for a long time (at least 100 to 150 days) after the decay starts,to avoid all chances of the infection reappearing.","Chateerjee, S.; Vani, V.

275,Evidence for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from epidemiological data series,"The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York's mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.","Yubero, P.; Lavin, A.

276,Effective Contact Tracing for COVID-19: A Systematic Review,"Background: Contact tracing is commonly recommended to control outbreaks of COVID-19, but its effectiveness is unclear. This systematic review aimed to examine contact tracing effectiveness in the context of COVID-19. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and All EBM Reviews were searched using a range of terms related to contact tracing for COVID-19. Articles were included if they reported on the ability of contact tracing to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 or on characteristics of effective tracing efforts. Two investigators screened all studies. Results: A total of 33 articles were found. All were observational or modelling studies, so the quality of the evidence was low. Overall, 15 out of 15 observational studies (100%) and 16 out of 18 (89%) modelling studies reported that contact tracing (alone or in combination with other interventions) was associated with better control of COVID-19. Under assumptions of prompt and thorough tracing with no further transmission, modelling studies found that contact tracing could stop an outbreak (e.g. by reducing the reproduction number from 2.2 to 0.57) or reduce infections (e.g. by 24%-71% with a mobile tracing app). Under assumptions of slower, less efficient tracing, modelling studies suggested that tracing could slow, but not stop COVID-19. Conclusions: Observational and modelling studies suggest that contact tracing is associated with better control of COVID-19. Its effectiveness likely depends on a number of factors, including how many and how fast contacts are traced and quarantined, and how effective quarantines are at preventing further transmission. A cautious interpretation suggests that to stop the spread of COVID-19, public health practitioners have 2-3 days from the time a new case develops symptoms to isolate the case and quarantine at least 80% of its contacts, and that once isolated, cases and contacts should infect zero new cases. Less efficient tracing may slow, but not stop, the spread of COVID-19. Inefficient tracing (with delays of 4-5+ days or less than 60% of contacts quarantined without further transmission) may not contribute meaningfully to control of COVID-19.","Juneau, C.-E.; Briand, A.-S.; Pueyo, T.; Collazzo, P.; Potvin, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160234v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160234v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
277,Pediatric intensive care unit admissions for COVID-19: insights using state level data,"Introduction Intensive care has played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic as many patients developed severe pulmonary complications. The availability of information in pediatric intensive care (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 dashboard virtual pediatric system containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions and social distancing score. The absolute CPAs count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPAs frequency and endpoints. Results A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPAs frequency was 2.8 per million children. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted with 6.3% positive tests. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days [1.25-12.00 days]. Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 [52.2%] were for mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 [1.4%]. Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPA's with greater population density [beta-coefficient 0.01, p<0.01] and increased percent of children receiving the influenza vaccination [beta-coefficient 0.17, p=0.01]. Conclusions Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density while characteristics of illness severity appear to be associated with ultraviolet index, temperature, and comorbidities such as Type 1 diabetes. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","Loomba, R. S.; Villarreal, E. G.; Farias, J. S.; Bronicki, R.

278,Sentiment Informed Timeseries Analyzing AI (SITALA) to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Houston,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has evolved into a pandemic with many unknowns. Houston, located in the Harris County of Texas, is becoming the next hotspot of this pandemic. With a severe decline in international and inter-state travel, a model at the county level, as opposed to the state or country level, is needed. Existing approaches have a few drawbacks. Firstly, the data used is the number of COVID-19 positive cases instead of positivity. The former is a function of the number of tests carried out while the latter is normalized by the number of tests. Positivity gives a better picture of the spread of this pandemic as with time more tests are being administered. Positivity under 5% has been desired for the reopening of businesses to almost 100% capacity. Secondly, the data used by models like SEIRD lacks information about the sentiment of people with respect to coronavirus. Thirdly, models that make use of social media posts might have too much noise. News sentiment, on the other hand, can capture long term effects of hidden variables like public policy, opinions of local doctors, and disobedience of state-wide mandates. The present study introduces a new AI model, viz., Sentiment Informed Timeseries Analyzing AI (SITALA), that has been trained on COVID-19 test positivity data and news sentiment from over 2750 news articles for the Harris county. The news sentiment was obtained using IBM Watson Discovery News. SITALA is inspired by Google-Wavenet architecture and makes use of TensorFlow. The mean absolute error for the training dataset of 66 consecutive days is 2.76 and that for the test dataset of 22 consecutive days is 9.6. The model forecasts that in order to curb the spread of coronavirus in Houston, a sustained negative news sentiment will be desirable. Public policymakers may use SITALA to set the tone of the local policies and mandates.","Desai, P.

279,Evaluating Scenarios for School Reopening under COVID19,"Thousands of school systems have been struggling with the decisions about how to safely and effectively deliver education during the fall semester of 2020, amid the COVID19 pandemic. The objective of this study is to evaluate the public health impact of reopening schools on the spread of COVID19. An agent-based simulation model was adapted and used to project the number of infections and deaths under multiple school reopening dates and scenarios, including different cohorts receiving in-person instruction on alternating days, only younger children returning to in-person instruction, regular schedule (all students receiving in-person instruction), and school closure (all students receiving online instruction). The study period was February 18th-November 24th, 2020 and the state of Georgia was used as a case study. Across all scenarios, the number of COVID19-related deaths ranged from approximately 17 to 22 thousand during the study period, and on the peak day, the number of new infections ranged from 43 to 68 thousand. An alternating school day schedule performed: (i) almost as well as keeping schools closed, with the infection attack rate ranging from 38.5% to 39.8% compared to that of 37.7% under school closure; (ii) slightly better than only allowing children 10 years or younger to return to in-person instruction. Delaying the reopening of schools had a minimal impact on reducing infections and deaths under most scenarios.","Keskinocak, P.; Asplund, J.; Serban, N.; Oruc Aglar, B.

280,Decreasing median age of COVID-19 cases in the United States: changing epidemiology or changing surveillance?,"Background Understanding and monitoring the demographics of SARS CoV2 infection can inform strategies for prevention. Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS CoV2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. Methods Retrospective review of SARS CoV2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March to April 2020) and late periods (June to July 2020) of the COVID 19 pandemic. Additionally, a subanalysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. Results There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0, 54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0, 50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. Conclusions We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize.","Greene, D. N.; Jackson, M. L.; Hillyard, D. R.; Delgado, J. C.; Schmidt, R.

281,"An in-silico study on SARS-CoV-2: Its compatibility with human tRNA pool, and the polymorphism arising in a single lineage over a month","SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has costed enormous human lives in the recent past. The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORFs stability and tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA, ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50% ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.

SignificanceSurvivability of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is essential for its spread. It has overlapping genes exhibiting a high codon optimization with humans even after a higher codon usage bias. They seem to possess cognizance for high copy number t-RNA (cognate or near-cognate) in humans, while mutating. Even though, it has been well established that native transcripts posses the highest stability, our in-silico studies show that SARS-CoV-2 under mutations give rise to ORFs with higher stability. These results significantly present the viruss ability and the credibility of survival for the mutants. Despite its focus on a geographical location it explains the ongoing behavior of SARS-CoV-2 for a steady existence in humans as all the different lineages have a common origin.

282,Circulating cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in patients who have recovered from COVID-19,"To investigate the immune status of people who previously had COVID-19 infections, we recruited patients 2 weeks post-recovery and analyzed circulating cytokines and lymphocyte subsets. We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by flow cytometry. We found that in most post-recovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8 + T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells(51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF- (89.71%), IFN-{gamma} (100%) and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, 2-week post-recovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-17. Among post-recovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma}. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, post-recovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system has gradually recovered following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital. Longitudinal studies of a larger cohort of recovered patients are needed to fully understand the consequences of the infection.","None, H.; Zhang, X.; Li, X.; Li, X.; Li, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160259v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160259v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True

Results show that in Berlin (Germany), behavioral changes of the population mostly happened textit{before} the government-initiated so-called contact ban came into effect. Also, the model is used to determine differentiated changes to the reinfection rate for different interventions such as reductions in activity participation, the wearing of masks, or contact tracing followed by quarantine-at-home. One important result is that successful contact tracing reduces the reinfection rate by about 30 to 40%, and that if contact tracing becomes overwhelmed then infection rates immediately jump up accordingly, making rather strong lockdown measures necessary to bring the reinfection rate back to below one.","Müller, S.

284,An analysis of mortality in Ontario using cremation data: Rise in cremations during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on all-cause mortality in Ontario is unknown. Cremations are performed for most deaths in Ontario and require coroner certification before the cremation can take place. Our objective was to provide timely analysis of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic using cremation data. Methods: This study describes cremation certificate data from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020, in Ontario. Cremation records during 2020 were compared to historical records from 2017-2019, grouped according to age, month, and place of death and further stratified by COVID-19 involvement. A time series model was fit to quantify the deviation in cremation trends during the COVID-19 period. Results: There have been 33 834 cremations in Ontario in 2020, and 20 898 (62%) took place from March onwards. In April, which saw the peak number of COVID-19 cases, had an additional 1,830 cremations compared to historical averages over 2017-2019, representing a 32% increase (3 871 in 2020). Time series modelling of cremations in Ontario from January 2017 demonstrated that cremations in March, April, and May 2020 exceeded the predicted increase based on modelled estimates. Even without the COVID-19 deaths, the seasonal and numerical trends for 2020 are substantially different from the historical period. Interpretation: Cremations were higher in the months during the pandemic compared to previous years. These early estimates of mortality are critical for understanding the impact of COVID-19. This study has demonstrated the utility of cremation data to provide timely mortality information during a public health emergency.","Postill, G.; Murray, R.; Wilton, A.; Wells, R.

285,The collective wisdom in the COVID-19 research: comparison and synthesis of epidemiological parameter estimates in preprints and peer-reviewed articles,"Background Research papers related to COVID-19 have exploded. We aimed to explore the academic value of preprints through comparing with peer-reviewed publications, and synthesize the parameter estimates of the two kinds of literature. Method We collected papers regarding the estimation of four key epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 in China: the basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate (CFR). PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arRxiv, and SSRN were searched by 20 March, 2020. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Further, four parameters were synthesized by bootstrap, and their validity was verified by susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model based on the context of China. Findings 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, despite that the timeliness of preprints was better. Four parameter estimates changed over time. Synthesized estimates of R0 (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and CFR (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained from the whole parameters space, all with p<0.05. Their validity was evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of SEIRDC model, which matched well with the onset cases in China. Interpretation Preprints could reflect the changes of epidemic situation sensitively, and their academic value shouldn't be neglected.

286,The Optimal Allocation of Covid-19 Vaccines,"Covid-19 vaccine prioritization is key if the initial supply of the vaccine is limited. A reasonable policy will surely prioritize populations facing high risk of severe illness in high-exposure occupations. The challenge is deciding between high-risk populations in low-exposure occupations and those that are young and healthy but work in high-exposure occupations. We estimate occupation-based infection risks and use age-based infection fatality rates in a model to assign priorities over populations with different occupations and ages. Among others, we find that 50 year-old food-processing workers and 60 year-old financial advisors are equally prioritized. Our model suggests a vaccine distribution that emphasizes age-based mortality risk more than occupation-based exposure risk. Designating some occupations as essential does not affect the optimal vaccine allocation, unless a stay-at-home order is also in effect. Even with vaccines allocated optimally, 1.37% of the employed workforce is still expected to be infected with the virus until the vaccine becomes widely available, provided the vaccine is 50% effective and assuming a supply of 60mil doses.","Babus, A.; Das, S.; Lee, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160143v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160143v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
287,Tissue-specific and interferon-inducible expression of non-functional ACE2 through endogenous retrovirus co-option,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as a regulator of several physiological processes. ACE2 has recently been proposed to be interferon-inducible, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit this phenomenon to enhance viral spread and questioning the efficacy of interferon treatment in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using a recent de novo transcript assembly that captured previously unannotated transcripts, we describe a novel isoform of ACE2, generated by co-option of an intronic long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelement promoter. The novel transcript, termed LTR16A1-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and, importantly, is highly responsive to interferon stimulation. In stark contrast, expression of canonical ACE2 is completely unresponsive to interferon stimulation. Moreover, the LTR16A1-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection.","Ng, K.; Attig, J.; Bolland, W.; Young, G.; Major, J.; Wack, A.; Kassiotis, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219139v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219139v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,False
288,Host transcriptional responses and SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the nasopharyngeal samples of Bangladeshi COVID-19 patients,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, fatality and cases of new infections are also increasing at an alarming rate. SARS-CoV-2 follows a highly variable course and it is becoming more evident that individuals immune system has a decisive influence on the progression of the disease. However, the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 mediate disease pathogenesis are largely unknown. Only a few host transcriptional responses in COVID-19 have been reported so far from the Western world, but no such data has been generated from the South-Asian region yet to correlate the conjectured lower fatality around this part of the globe. In this context, we aimed to perform the transcriptomic profiling of the COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh along with the reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from these patients. Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis to demonstrate how differently the various SARS-CoV-2 infection systems are responding to the viral pathogen. We detected a unique missense mutation at 10329 position of ORF1ab gene, annotated to 3C like proteinase, which is found in 75% of our analyzed isolates; but is very rare globally. Upon the functional enrichment analyses of differentially modulated genes, we detected a similar host induced response reported earlier; this response was mainly mediated by the innate immune system, interferon stimulation, and upregulated cytokine expression etc. in the Bangladeshi patients. Surprisingly, we did not perceive the induction of apoptotic signaling, phagosome formation, antigen presentation and production, hypoxia response within these nasopharyngeal samples. Furthermore, while comparing with the other SARS-CoV-2 infection systems, we spotted that lung cells trigger the more versatile immune and cytokine signaling which was several folds higher compared to our reported nasopharyngeal samples. We also observed that lung cells did not express ACE2 in a very high amount as suspected, however, the nasopharyngeal cells are found overexpressing ACE2. But the amount of DPP4 expression within the nasal samples was significantly lower compared to the other cell types. Surprisingly, we observed that lung cells express a very high amount of integrins compared to the nasopharyngeal samples, which might suggest the putative reasons for an increased amount of viral infections in the lungs. From the network analysis, we got clues on the probable viral modulation for the overexpression of these integrins.

However, there is currently no dedicated method to identify viral co-infections in patient RNA-seq data. We developed PACIFIC, a deep-learning algorithm that accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other common RNA respiratory viruses from RNA-seq data. Using in silico data, PACIFIC recovers the presence and relative concentrations of viruses with >99% precision and recall. PACIFIC accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in 63 independent in vitro cell culture and patient datasets.

290,Co-expression of Mitochondrial Genes and ACE2 in Cornea Involved in COVID-19 Infection,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic severely challenges public health and necessitates the need for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and propagation. Here, the co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known ACE2, TMPRSS2 and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 GWAS onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. Gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Our co-expression and protein interaction network analysis uncover that the mitochondrial function related genes in cornea contribute to the dissection of COVID-19 susceptibility and potential therapeutic interventions.","Yuan, J.; Fan, d.; Xue, Z.; Qu, J.; Su, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.216770v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.216770v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,False

To evaluate the tradeoffs between potential benefits (e.g., reduction in infection spread and deaths) of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID19 and being homebound (i.e., refraining from community/workplace interactions). Methods. An agent-based simulation model to project the disease spread and estimate the number of homebound people and person-days under multiple scenarios, including combinations of shelter-in-place, voluntary quarantine, and school closure in Georgia from March 1 to September 1, 2020. Results. Compared to no intervention, under voluntary quarantine, voluntary quarantine with school closure, and shelter-in-place with school closure scenarios 3.43, 19.8, and 200+ homebound adult-days were required to prevent one infection, with the maximum number of adults homebound on a given day in the range of 121K-268K, 522K-567K, 5,377K-5,380K, respectively. Conclusions. Voluntary quarantine combined with school closure significantly reduced the number of infections and deaths with a considerably smaller number of homebound person-days compared to shelter-in-place.","Oruc Aglar, B.

293,High Affinity Nanobodies Block SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain Interaction with Human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme,"There are currently no approved effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Nanobodies are 12-15 kDa single-domain antibody fragments that are more stable and amenable to large-scale production compared to conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can also be administered in an inhaled form directly to the lungs. We have isolated several nanobodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and block spike protein interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is responsible for viral entry into human cells via interaction with ACE2 on the cell surface. The lead therapeutic candidate, NIH-CoVnb-112, binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain at approximately 5 nM affinity, and blocks spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor at approximately 0.02 micrograms/mL EC50 (1.1 nM). The affinity and blocking potency of NIH-CoVnb-112 are substantially better than previously reported candidate nanobody therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, and bind to a distinct site. Furthermore, NIH-CoVnb-112 blocks interaction between ACE2 and several high affinity variant forms of the spike protein. When multimerized or combined with other nanobodies, the effective affinity and blocking interactions may be even more potent, as has been well described for other nanobody therapeutics. These resulting nanobodies have therapeutic, preventative, and diagnostic potential.","Esparza, T. J.; Brody, D.

294,"Identification, Mapping and Relative Quantitation of SARS-Cov2 Spike Glycopeptides by Mass-Retention Time Fingerprinting","We describe a novel analytical method for rapid and robust identification, mapping and relative quantitation of glycopeptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The method may be executed using any LC-TOF mass spectrometer, requires no specialised knowledge of glycan analysis and makes use of the differential resolving power of reversed phase HPLC. While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. While this has previously been viewed as a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike. This database allows any ESI-TOF equipped lab to reliably identify and quantify spike glycans from a single overnight elastase protein digest in less than 90 minutes.","Chalk, R.; Greenland, W.; Moreira, T.; Coker, J.; Mukhopadhyay, S.; Williams, E.; Manning, C.; Bohstedt, T.; McCrorie, R.; Fernandez-Cid, A.; Burgess-Brown, N.

295,Elucidation of cryptic and allosteric pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 protease,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly spread across the globe, posing an urgent health concern. Many quests to computationally identify treatments against the virus rely on in silico small molecule docking to experimentally determined structures of viral proteins. One limit to these approaches is that protein dynamics are often unaccounted for, leading to overlooking transient, druggable conformational states. Using Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to enhance sampling of conformational space, we identified cryptic pockets within the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including some within regions far from the active site and assed their druggability. These pockets can aid in virtual screening efforts to identify a protease inhibitor for the treatment of COVID-19.

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of five healthy donors and 13 COVID-19 patients including moderate, severe and convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in COVID-19 patients showed a strong interferon-alpha response, and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ Effector-GNLY (Granulysin), CD8+ Effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of immune responses during the disease progression.","Wang, F.-S.; Zhang, J.-Y.; Wang, X.; Xing, X.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, C.; Song, J.-W.; Fan, X.; Xia, P.; Fu, J.-L.; Wang, S.-Y.; Xu, R.-N.; Dai, X.-P.; Shi, L.; Huang, L.; Jiang, T.-J.; Shi, M.; Zhang, Y.; Zumla, A.; Maeurer, M.; Bai, F.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217703v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217703v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,False

298,The answer lies in the energy: how simple atomistic molecular dynamics simulations may hold the key to epitope prediction on the fully glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is posing a major threat to human health and its diffusion around the world is having dire socioeconomical consequences. Thanks to the scientific communitys unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic solutions.

Herein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.

Our results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield: glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains, synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.","Serapian, S.; Marchetti, F.; Triveri, A.; Morra, G.; Meli, M.; Moroni, E.; Sautto, G.

The dearth of potential vaccines has left the survival of mankind with doubts. The development of multi-epitope vaccine in this current situation could be a possible COVID treatment. We have designed a novel multi-epitope, multi-protein vaccine with different proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) with immuno-informatics approaches, which has been validated in silico to be stable and potential. It has been prepared with Cytotoxic T-cell (TC) and Helper T-cell (TH) binding epitopes overlapping with B-cell binding epitopes predicted for 6 proteins conserved among 4 different viral strains isolated across the world. Both the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are ensured due to the presence of T cell and B-cell inducing epitopes along with interferon-gamma inducing epitopes present in the vaccine. The final vaccine construct comprises of an adjuvant at the N terminal, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte and Helper T Lymphocyte epitopes. The construct showed potential antigenicity and was non-allergic. The molecular docking of the refined, validated tertiary structure model of the vaccine was performed with immune-stimulatory Toll Like Receptors (TLR), TLR-2,3,4. The study of binding energetics of the docked complexes revealed binding interactions of receptor with vaccine. The immune simulation of the vaccine even confirmed the initiation of elevated host immune responses. The efficient translation of the vaccine in an expression vector was confirmed with in silico cloning approach. Certainly, the development of such vaccine candidate could possibly be an effective therapy for COVID-19.","Banerjee, S.; Majumder, K.; Gutierrez, G.

300,Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System inhibitor use in patients with COVID-19 infection and prevention of serious events: a cohort study in commercially insured patients in the US,"Objectives: There is a lack of clarity regarding the role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in interfering with the SARS-COV-2 binding on human cells and the resulting change in disease severity. We sought to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications in current users of ARB or ACEi compared to users of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (dhpCCB). Design: Cohort study Setting: The analysis used de-identified, patient-level data from HealthVerity, linking longitudinal data from US medical and pharmacy claims, which contain information on inpatient or outpatient diagnoses, procedures and medication dispensing. Participants: We identified patients aged 40+ and free of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were newly diagnosed COVID-19, between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020, and adherent to ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB therapy. Interventions: Current use of an ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB. Main outcome measures: We compared the 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications. Results: Of 24,708 patients identified, 7,571 were current users of an ARB, 8,484 of an ACEi, and 8,653 of a dhpCCB. The unadjusted 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 2.66% among ARB users, and 2.90% among ACEi users and 3.68% in dhpCCB users. In the PS-matched cohort, the risk of hospitalization among ARB users was 17% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.83; 0.68-1.00), and the risk among ACE users was 10% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.90; 0.76-1.07). When including patients with pre-existing CKD, the protective effect of ARB (RR= 0.74; 0.62-0.88) and ACEi (RR=0.84; 0.71-0.99) was more pronounced. Conclusions: This cohort study showed that neither ARB nor ACEi use increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease among those infected, and instead suggests that current use of ARB may offer a protective effect. This study found no evidence to support the discontinuation of ARB/ACEi therapy.","Schneeweiss, M.

Robust estimates of key time-to-event distributions remain scarce as well. Objective Illustrate SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns and risk factors, and estimate key time-to-event distributions. Design, Setting, and Participants Individual-based data on 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 contacts identified by contact tracing monitoring over the period from January 13-April 02, 2020 were extracted from the notifiable infectious diseases reporting system in Hunan Province, China. Demographic characteristics, severity classification, exposure and travel history, and key clinical timelines were retrieved. Exposures Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction test result of respiratory samples, and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals via household, relative, social, and other types of contacts. Main Outcomes and Measures The relative contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, key time-to-event parameters, and the effect of biological, demographic, and behavioral factors on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and susceptibility were quantified. Results Among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, the estimated mean serial interval was 5.5 days (95%CI -5.0, 19.9) and the mean generation time was 5.5 days (95%CI 1.7, 11.6). Infectiousness was estimated to peak 1.8 days before symptom onset, with 95% of transmission events occurring between -7.6 days and 7.3 days from the date of symptom onset. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated at 62.5%, while a lower bound for the proportion of asymptomatic transmission was 3.5%. Infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly different between working-age adults (15-59 years old) and other age groups (0-14 years old: p-value=0.16; 60 years and over: p-value=0.33), whilst susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated to increase with age (p-value=0.03). In addition, transmission risk was higher for household contacts (p-value<0.001), but decreased in later generations of a cluster (second generation: OR=0.13, p-value<0.001; generations 3-4: OR=0.05, p-value<0.001, relative to generation 1) and for those exposed to infectors with a larger number of contacts (p-value=0.04). Conclusions and Relevance These findings support the contribution of children to transmission and the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission, in turn highlighting the importance of large-scale testing, contact tracing activities, and the use of personnel protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hu, S.; Wang, W.; Wang, Y.; Litvinova, M.; Luo, K.; Ren, L.; Sun, Q.; Chen, X.; Zeng, G.; Li, J.; Liang, L.; Deng, Z.; Zheng, W.; Li, M.; Yang, H.; Guo, J.; Wang, K.; Chen, X.; Liu, Z.; Yan, H.; Shi, H.; Chen, Z.; Zhou, Y.; Sun, K.; Vespignani, A.; Viboud, C.; Gao, L.; Ajelli, M.; Yu, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160317v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160317v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
305,"Clinical Impact, Costs, and Cost-Effectiveness of Expanded SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Massachusetts","Background We projected the clinical and economic impact of alternative testing strategies on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Massachusetts using a microsimulation model. Methods We compared five testing strategies: 1) PCR-severe-only: PCR testing only patients with severe/critical symptoms; 2) Self-screen: PCR-severe-only plus self-assessment of COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 3) PCR-any-symptom: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms with self-isolation if positive; 4) PCR-all: PCR-any-symptom and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 5) PCR-all-repeat: PCR-all with monthly re-testing. We examined effective reproduction numbers (Re, 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). Results In all scenarios, PCR-all-repeat would lead to the best clinical outcomes and PCR-severe-only would lead to the worst; at Re 0.9, PCR-all-repeat vs. PCR-severe-only resulted in a 63% reduction in infections and a 44% reduction in deaths, but required >65-fold more tests/day with 4-fold higher costs. PCR-all-repeat had an ICER <$100,000/QALY only when Re[&ge;]1.8. At all Re values, PCR-any-symptom was cost-saving compared to other strategies. Conclusions Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to restricting testing to only those with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. Universal screening would be cost-effective when paired with monthly retesting in settings where the COVID-19 pandemic is surging.","Neilan, A. M.; Losina, E.; Bangs, A.

306,Complement C3 identified as a unique Risk Factor for Disease Severity among Young COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan,"Background Given that a substantial proportion of the subgroup of COVID-19 patients that face a severe disease course are younger than 60 years, it is critical to understand the disease-specific characteristics of young COVID-19 patients. Risk factors for a severe disease course for young COVID-19 patients and possibly non-linear influences remain unknown. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th, were analyzed. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate and exploit the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. Results A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile ranges [IQR] 38 - 55, range 16 - 60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of ASS, CRP and LDH, and decreased lymphocyte counts are influential on disease severity independent of age. Elevated levels of complement C3 (odds ratio [OR] 15.6, 95% CI 2.41-122.3; p=0.039) are particularly associated with the risk for the development of severity specifically in young patients, where no such influence seems to exist for elderly patients. Additional analysis suggests that the influence of complement C3 in young patients is independent of age, gender, and comorbidities. Variable importance values and partial dependence plots obtained using random forests delivered additional insights, in particular indicating non-linear influences of risk factors on disease severity. Conclusion In young patients with COVID-19, the levels of complement C3 correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.","Cheng, W.; Hornung, R.; Xu, K.; Li, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161414v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161414v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
307,ASSESSING THE AGE SPECIFICITY OF INFECTION FATALITY RATES FOR COVID-19: META-ANALYSIS & PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS,"This paper assesses the age specificity of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19. Our benchmark meta-regression synthesizes the age-specific IFRs from six recent large-scale seroprevalence studies conducted in Belgium, Geneva, Indiana, New York, Spain, and Sweden. The estimated IFR is close to zero for children and younger adults but rises exponentially with age, reaching about 0.3 percent for ages 50-59, 1.3 percent for ages 60-69, 4.6 percent for ages 70-79, and 25 percent for ages 80 and above. We compare those predictions to the age-specific IFRs implied by recent seroprevalence estimates for nine other U.S. locations, three smale-scale studies, and three countries (Iceland, New Zealand, and Republic of Korea) that have engaged in comprehensive tracking and tracing of COVID-19 infections. We also review seroprevalence studies of 32 other locations whose design was not well-suited for estimating age-specific IFRs. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 is not just dangerous for the elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults, for whom the fatality rate is more than 50 times greater than the risk of dying in an automobile accident. Consequently, the overall IFR for a given location is intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. In a scenario where the U.S. infection rate reaches 20 percent, our analysis indicates that protecting vulnerable age groups could prevent more than 200,000 deaths.","Levin, A. T.; Cochran, K.

308,"Weather, Social Distancing, and the Spread ofCOVID-19","Using high-frequency panel data for U.S. counties, I estimate the full dynamic response of COVID-19 cases and deaths to exogenous movements in mobility and weather. I find several important results. First, holding mobility fixed, temperature is found to have a negative and significant effect on COVID-19 cases from 1 to 8 weeks ahead and on deaths from 2 to 8 weeks ahead. Second, holding weather fixed, mobility is found to have a large positive effect on subsequent growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The impact on cases becomes significant 3 to 4 weeks ahead and continues through 8 to 10 weeks ahead. The impact on deaths becomes significant around 4 weeks ahead and persists for at least 10 weeks. Third, I find that the deleterious effects of mobility on COVID-19 outcomes are far greater when the local virus transmission rate is above one -- evidence supportive of public health policies aiming to reduce mobility specifically in places experiencing high transmission rates while relaxing restrictions elsewhere. Fourth, I find that the dynamic effects of mobility on cases are generally similar across counties, but the effects on deaths are higher for counties with older populations and, surprisingly, counties with lower black or hispanic population shares. Lastly, I find that while the marginal impact of mobility changes has been stable over recent weeks for cases, it has come down for deaths.","Wilson, D.

309,COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and mode of death in a dynamic and non-restricted tertiary care model in Germany,"Background Reported mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies substantially, particularly in critically ill patients. So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied. Methods This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. Results Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age >=65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","Rieg, S.; von Cube, M.; Kalbhenn, J.; Utzolino, S.; Pernice, K.; Bechet, L.; Baur, J.; Lang, C.

310,Local measures enable COVID-19 containment with fewer restrictions due to cooperative effects,"Many countries worldwide that were successful in containing the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic are faced with the seemingly impossible choice between the resurgence of infections and endangering the economic and mental well-being of their citizens. While blanket measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries. We hope that our analysis will help create sustainable, theory-driven long-term strategies for the management of the COVID-19 epidemic until therapy or immunization options are available.","Bittihn, P.; Hupe, L.; Isensee, J.; Golestanian, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161364v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161364v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
311,Adherence to protective measures among health care workers in the UK; a cross-sectional study,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are frontline responders to emergency infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. We investigated factors associated with adherence to personal protective behaviours in UK HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online cross-sectional survey of 1035 healthcare professionals in the UK. Data were collected between 12th and 16th June 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to separately investigate factors associated with adherence to use of personal protective equipment, maintaining good hand hygiene, and physical distancing from colleagues. Adherence to personal protective measures was suboptimal (PPE use: 80.0%, 95% CI [77.3 to 82.8], hand hygiene: 67.8%, 95% CI [64.6 to 71.0], coming into close contact with colleagues: 74.7%, 95% CI [71.7 to 77.7]). Adherence to PPE use was associated with having adequate PPE resources, receiving training during the pandemic, lower perceived fatalism from COVID-19, higher perceived social norms and higher perceived effectiveness of PPE. Adherence to physical distancing was associated with one's workplace being designed, using markings to facilitate physical distancing and receiving training during the pandemic. There were few associations with adherence to hand hygiene. Findings indicate HCWs should receive training on personal protective behaviours to decrease fatalism over contracting COVID-19 and increase perceived effectiveness of protective measures.","Smith, L.

312,"Concerns, quality of life, access to care and productivity of the general population during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has a disruptive impact on our society. We therefore conducted a population survey to describe: 1) stress, concerns and quality of life 2) access to healthcare and cancelled/delayed healthcare and 3) productivity during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the general population. Methods: An online survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included questions about stress, concerns, quality of life delayed/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children <12 years, respondents aged 18-35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: This study describes stress, quality of life, medical resource loss and productivity losses in Belgium and the Netherlands after 8 weeks of coronavirus lockdown.

313,The impact of COVID-19 on patients with asthma: A Big Data analysis,"Background: From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of certain medical chronic conditions has been suggested. However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the burden of the disease in patients with asthma has been less evident. Objective: This study aims at a better understanding of the burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma and the impact of asthma, its related comorbidities, and treatment on the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020 using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform. Results: Out of 71,192 patients with asthma, 1,006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 vs. 42 years), predominantly female (66% vs. 59%), had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently. Contrarily, allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (P < .001). Higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity was also confirmed in those patients with asthma and COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The percentage of individuals using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalized patients (48.3% vs. 61.5%; OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). During the study period, 865 (1.21%) patients with asthma were being treated with biologics. Although these patients showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) level, their hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were relatively low (0.23%). COVID-19 increased inpatient mortality in asthmatic patients (2.29% vs 0.54%; OR 2.29: 95% CI 4.35-6.66). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in patients with asthma has been low, although higher than the observed in the general population. Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and were at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection.","Izquierdo, J.

315,Epidemiological and cohort study finds no association between COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Background Reports of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. Methods The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared. Results The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7/13, 54% vs 5/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Conclusions This study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","Keddie, S.; Pakpoor, J.; Mousele, C.; Pipis, M.; Machado, P.

316,SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey in Health Care Workers of the Veneto Region,"Background: The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses formidable challenges to all health care systems. Serological assays may improve disease management when appropriately used, for better understanding the antibody responses mounted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impratical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. Aim: we evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods: both IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical EngineeringCo., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China) Results: A total of 8285 health care workers were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% women and 5% men, but the difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all severe COVID-19 patients (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion: Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study has the statistical power to define precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of health workers in our region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.","Plebani, M.; Padoan, A.; Fedeli, U.; Schievano, E.; Vecchiato, E.; Lippi, G.; Lo Cascio, G.; Porru, S.; Palu, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160457v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160457v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True

318,"Forecasting hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in South Dakota, USA.","Anticipating the number of hospital beds needed for patients with COVID-19 remains a challenge. Early efforts to predict hospital bed needs focused on deriving predictions from SIR models, largely at the level of countries, provinces, or states. In the United States, these models rely on data reported by state health agencies. However, predictive disease and hospitalization dynamics at the state level are complicated by geographic variation in disease parameters. In addition it is difficult to make forecasts early in a pandemic due to minimal data. However, Bayesian approaches that allow models to be specified with informed prior information from areas that have already completed a disease curve can serve as prior estimates for areas that are beginning their curve. Here, a Bayesian non-linear regression (Weibull function) was used to forecast cumulative and active COVID-19 hospitalizations for South Dakota, USA. As expected, early forecasts were dominated by prior information, which was derived from New York City. Importantly, hospitalization trends also differed within South Dakota due to early peaks in an urban area, followed by later peaks in other rural areas of the state. Combining these trends led to altered forecasts with relevant policy implications.","Wesner, J.

Our results confirm our previous finding, further showing that the incidence of COVID-19 on the American continent decreases significantly starting at 1,000 m above sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates that the virus transmission rate capacity is lower in the highlands (>1,000 masl) than in the lowlands (<1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating the differences in the recovery percentage of patients, the death-to-case ratio, and the theoretical fraction of undiagnosed cases, we found that the severity of COVID-19 is also decreased above 1,000 m. We conclude that the impact of the COVID-19 decreases significantly with altitude.","Arias-Reyes, C.; Carvajal-Rodriguez, F.; Poma-Machicao, L.; Aliaga-Raduan, F.; Marques, D.

321,Heat-based Decontamination of N95 Masks Using a Commercial Laundry Dryer,"We propose a dry heat method for decontaminating N95 masks of SARS-CoV-2, designed around placing them in resealable plastic bags, packed in large cardboard boxes installed at the rear end of commercial laundry dryers. Our protocol rests on data collected in collaboration with Alliance Laundry Systems (ALS) and the CDC/NIOSH laboratories, under the ""NPPTL Respirator Assess- ments to Support the COVID-19 Response"" initiative. We test the two most widely available ALS tumbler models, the UTF75N and UT075N, and show that if our procedure is carefully followed, the masks will be subject to suitably high and stable temperatures for decontamination; in particular the masks will be heated to at least 80C for at least 65 min. For the mask models 3M 1860, 3M 8511, and Halyard 62126, we establish that they pass quantitative fit tests and retain sufficient filtration performance after three cycles of our decontamination procedure. All masks used in this study were new and uncontaminated: the evidence for the levels of biological inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is provided by [1]. While the protocol outlined here is currently specific to certain tested dryer models, this equipment is widely available, with machines estimated to be within 15 minutes of most US hospitals. Models from other manufacturers may also be appropriate for this decontamination method, though we stress the need for explicit testing on alternative models before use.","Lensky, Y.

322,Geographic reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Lombardy (Italy) during the early phase,"The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern part of the peninsula, source of alarming and prolonged infections in Lombardy region, in Codogno and Bergamo areas especially. The aim of the study was to expand understanding on the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the affected Lombardy areas. To this purpose, twenty full length genomes were collected from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020. The obtained genome assemblies, available on the GISAD database and performed at the Referral Center for COVID-19 diagnosis, identified 2 main monophyletic clades, containing 9 and 52 isolates, respectively. The molecular clock analysis estimated a clusters divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains spread all over the world at different time, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, the epidemiological reconstruction carried out by this work highlights multiple inputs of the virus into its initial circulation in Lombardy Region. However, a phylogenetic reconstruction robustness will be improved when other genomic sequences will be available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.","Micheli, V.; Rimoldi, S.

323,What factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak? A rapid review of the evidence,"Introduction During any emerging infectious disease outbreak, people with symptoms of the illness are often asked to report their symptoms to the health service in a timely manner, to facilitate contract tracing. Numerous factors may influence an individuals willingness to report these symptoms. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic Objective To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak Methods We conducted a rapid review of the evidence. We included papers based on primary research, published in peer-reviewed journals, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak Results Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (accurate and informative communication, symptom severity, concern about exposure, ease of access, and relationship with the healthcare provider). Seven themes were identified as barriers of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (lack of knowledge, fear, stigmatization, invasion of privacy, low concerns about symptoms, economics, and practicalities of attending a healthcare facility) Discussion If contract tracing services are to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate the information provided to the public about such a service, the routes of access, and the underlying polices relating to the service, in order to ensure that as many people as possible with relevant symptoms will make contact","Carter, P.; Megnin-Viggars, O.; Rubin, G.

324,D614G Spike Mutation Increases SARS CoV-2 Susceptibility to Neutralization.,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and now globally is the dominant form of the virus. Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the early D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, G614 Spike pseudovirions were moderately more susceptible to neutralization, indicating this is not an escape mutation that would impede current vaccines. Rather, the gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies.","Weissman, D.; Alameh, M.-G.; LaBranche, C. C.; Edwards, R.

325,A multinational e-survey on the delivery of cardiology services in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic: what should we expect after this pandemic?,"Abstract Objective: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of cardiology services in Africa. Design: Cross-sectional e-survey study. Setting: African countries Participants: Cardiologists Primary and Secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was the change in service delivery in African cardiology units during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcomes were the satisfaction of cardiologists with regards to the workload and factors associated with this satisfaction. Results: There was a significant reduction in working time and the number of patients consulted by week during this pandemic (p<0.001). In general, there was a decrease in the overall activities in cardiovascular care delivery. The majority of cardiology services (76.5%) and consulting programs (85%) were adjusted to the pandemic. Only half of the participants were satisfied with their workload. Reconfiguration of the consultation schedule was associated with a reduced satisfaction of participants (p=0.02). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with an overall reduction in cardiology services rendered in Africa. Since the cardiovascular burdens continue to increase in this part of the World and the risk of cardiovascular complications linked to SARS COV2 remains unchanged cardiology, departments in Africa should anticipate a significant surge of cardiology services demanded by patients after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nganou-Gnindjio, C.

326,An novel epidemiological model for COVID-19,"COVID-19 is characterized by a large number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are difficult to detect; most of them remain unknown, still having an important role in the transmission of the disease, this make the pan- demic difficult to control. The purpose of this research is to develop an epidemi- ological model that allow to estimate the number of unknown/asymptomatic cases in a given area. The SEIAMPR system, a novel simulation based model for COVID-19 is designed and implemented in Python. The intuition of the model is simple: about 80% of COVID-19 infected people evolve as asymptomatic or with a mild clinical course, many of them remain unknown to the authorities, some of them including those in critical conditions are eventually detected and classified as positive cases. The simulator reproduces this process using an adaptive method integrated with official data. The simulator has been used for modelling the outbreak in 21 regions in Italy. The positive effects of lockdown policies are demonstrated: unknown ac- tive cases 12 days after the lockdown (March the 21th) ranged from 284101 to 374038, e.g. many more than all the official cases in Italy, reducing to 10213/20949 the reopening day. The number of unknown active cases at the beginning of June in the Lombardia region ranged from 6813 to 13390 de- manding particular attention. SEIAMPR is simple to tune and integrate with official data, it emerges as an up-and-coming tool for reporting the effect of lockdown measures, the impact of the disease on the population, and the remaining unknown active cases for evaluating the timing of exit strategies.","Gaspari, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160580v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160580v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
327,A Framework for SARS-CoV-2 Testing on a Large University Campus: Statistical Considerations,"We consider testing strategies for active SARS-CoV-2 infection for a large university community population, which we define. Components of such a strategy include individuals tested because they self-select or are recommended for testing by a health care provider for their own health care; individuals tested because they belong to a high-risk group where testing serves to disrupt transmission; and, finally, individuals randomly selected for testing from the university community population as part of a proactive community testing, or surveillance, program. The proactive community testing program is predicated on a mobile device application that asks individuals to self-monitor COVID-like symptoms daily. The goals of this report are (i) to provide a framework for estimating prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the university community wherein proactive community testing is a major component of the overall strategy, (ii) to address the issue of how many tests should be performed as part of the proactive community testing program, and (iii) to consider how effective proactive community testing will be for purposes of detection of new disease clusters. We argue that a comprehensive prevalence estimate informed by all testing done of the university community is a good metric to obtain a global picture of campus SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at a particular point in time and to monitor the dynamics of infection over time, for example, estimating the population-level reproductive number, R0). Importantly, the prevalence metric can be useful to campus leadership for decision making. One example involves comparing campus prevalence to that in the broader off-campus community. We also show that under some reasonable assumptions, we can obtain valid statements about the comprehensive prevalence by only testing symptomatic persons in the proactive community testing component. The number of tests performed for individual-level and high-risk group-level needs will depend on the disease dynamics, individual needs, and testing availability. For purposes of this report, we assume that, for these groups of individuals, inferential precision --- that is, the accuracy with which we can estimate the true prevalence from testing a random sample of individuals --- does not drive decisions on the number of tests. On the other hand, for proactive community testing, the desired level of inferential precision {in a fixed period of time can be used to justify the number of tests to perform {in that period. For example, our results show that, if we establish a goal of ruling out with 98% confidence a background prevalence of 2% {in a given week, and the actual prevalence is 1% among those eligible for proactive community testing, we would need to test 835 randomly-selected symptomatics (i.e., those presenting with COVID-like symptoms) per week via the proactive community testing program in a campus of 80k individuals. In addition to justifying decisions about the number of tests to perform, inferential precision can formalize the intuition that testing of symptomatic individuals should be prioritized over testing asymptomatic individuals in the proactive community testing program.","Rathouz, P.

329,Modelling Palliative and End of Life resource requirements during COVID-19: implications for quality care,"Background There were between 84,891 and 113,139 all-cause excess deaths in the United States (US) from February 1st to 25th May 2020. These deaths are widely attributed directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. This surge in death necessitates a matched health system response to relieve serious health related suffering at the end of life (EoL) and achieve a dignified death, through timely and appropriate expertise, medication and equipment. Identifying the human and material resource needed relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Methods A Discrete Event Simulation model designed in collaboration with health service funders, health providers, clinicians and modellers in the South West of England was created to estimate the resources required during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for deaths from COVID-19 in the community for a geographical area of nearly 1 million people. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. Results The model predicts that a mean of 11.97 hours (0.18 hours Standard Error (SE), up to a max of 28 hours) of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time (mean 9.17 hours, 0.23 hours SE), and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night-sits (mean of 5.74 hours per day, 0.22 hours SE) will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day (mean of 9.32 hours per day, 0.12 hours SE). An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles or ""just in case"" prescriptions per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles (0.06 SE) of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps (0.11 SE) could be needed to be in use per day (between 1 and 20 syringe pumps). Conclusion Modelling provides essential data to prepare, plan and deliver a palliative care pandemic response tailored to local work patterns and resource. The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","Chalk, D.; Robbins, S.; Kandasamy, R.; Rush, K.; Aggarwal, A.; Sullivan, R.; Chamberlain, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160564v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160564v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
330,The COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Primary Health Care services: An Experience from Qatar,"Introduction: In March 2020, Qatar started reporting increased numbers of COVID-19 positive cases. The Ministry of Public Health in Qatar has developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) as a main component of that response. Aim: The aim of this review is to understand and document the Impact of COVID 19 on PHCC in Qatar in terms of response, modifications of services and introduction of new alternatives Methodology: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the COVID-19 swabbing activities and for all the utilization services volume across the PHCC health centers between January 2018 and May 2020. Results: PHCC allocated testing sites for COVID-19 resulted in conducting 54824 swabs with 11455 positive cases and positivity rate of 20.8% between 14th of March and 15th of June 2020. The overall PHCC services utilization declined with overall reduction of 50% in April 2020. Alternative virtual and remote services were provided, telemedicine was introduced, and it made up 50% of the consultation volumes for April 2020. Home refill delivery medications managed to provide a total of 20920 delivered prescriptions by end of May 2020. Conclusion and recommendations: To decrease the risk of infection to the patients and health care workers, PHCC in Qatar cancelled the appointments for some high-risk population. However, PHCC introduced virtual remote services that managed to make up for the in-person utilization volume and reflected acceptance in patients behaviours.

331,Soap versus sanitiser for preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infections: a systematic review with meta-analysis and dose-response analysis,"Objective: To compare the effectiveness of hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand sanitiser to soap and water for preventing the transmission of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), and assess the relationship between the dose of hand hygiene and the number of ARI, influenza-like illness (ILI), or influenza events. Methods: Systematic review of randomised trials that compared a community-based hand hygiene intervention (soap and water, or sanitiser) with a control, or trials that compared sanitiser with soap and water, and measured outcomes of ARI, ILI, or laboratory-confirmed influenza or related consequences. Searches were conducted in CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and trial registries (April 2020) and data extraction completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Results: Eighteen trials were included. When meta-analysed, three trials of soap and water versus control found a non-significant increase in ARI events (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.23, 95%CI 0.78-1.93); six trials of sanitiser versus control found a significant reduction in ARI events (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.71-0.89). When hand hygiene dose was plotted against ARI relative risk, no clear dose-response relationship was observable. Four trials were head-to-head comparisons of sanitiser and soap and water but too heterogeneous to pool: two found a significantly greater reduction in the sanitiser group compared to the soap group; two found no significant difference between the intervention arms. Conclusion: Adequately performed hand hygiene, with either soap or sanitiser, reduces the risk of ARI virus transmission, however direct and indirect evidence suggest sanitiser might be more effective in practice.","Hoffmann, T.; Bakhit, M.; Krzyzaniak, N.; Del Mar, C.; Scott, A.; Glasziou, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160432v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160432v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True

We aimed to assess the variation in anxiety and risk perceptions of COVID-19 among adults in Singapore. We administered a web-survey to a panel of residents between 31 March and 14 April 2020. We assessed anxiety using general anxiety disorder (GAD) scale and assessed participants risk perceptions regarding severity of the outbreak. Of the 1,017 participants, 23% reported moderate to severe anxiety (GAD score above 10). A high proportion reported perceived likelihood of ICU admission (46%) and death (30%) upon getting COVID-19. Results from path analysis showed that younger participants, those with chronic conditions, those living with children and low perceived trust in government response to COVID-19 had a significantly higher anxiety mediated by their perceived risk of dying upon getting COVID-19.

333,Factors associated with psychological distress in health-care workers during an infectious disease outbreak: A rapid living systematic review,"Background: Health-care workers (HCW) are at risk for psychological distress during an infectious disease outbreak due to the demands of dealing with a public health emergency. Aims: To examine the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We conducted a rapid review of the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, Ebola). Four electronic databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and the first 10 pages of Google Scholar) were searched (2000 to 10 July 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research with a sample size >80. Results: From the 3335 records identified, 52 with data from 54,800 HCW were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk for contact with infected patients, and being quarantined, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organisational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlighted the profiles of HCW who may be most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak as well as several potential targets for interventions to reduce distress. More research is needed to track the associations of these factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and linked to sustained or transient distress.","Sirois, F.

Sample types include whole blood, plasma, serum, leukocytes, and DNA. The GCB links samples to detailed clinical data available in the GEN-COVID Patient Registry (GCPR). It includes hospitalized patients (74.25%), broken down into intubated, treated by CPAP-biPAP, treated with O2 supplementation, and without respiratory support (9.5%, 18.4%, 31.55% and 14.8, respectively); and non-hospitalized subjects (25.75%), either pauci- or asymptomatic. More than 150 clinical patient-level data fields have been collected and binarized according to the organs/systems primarily affected by COVID-19: heart, liver, pancreas, kidney, chemosensors, innate or adaptive immunity, and clotting system, for further statistics. Hierarchical Clustering analysis identified five main clinical categories: i) severe multisystemic failure with either thromboembolic or pancreatic variant; ii) cytokine storm type either severe with liver involvement or moderate; iii) moderate heart type either with or without liver damage; iv) moderate multisystemic involvement either with or without liver damage; v) mild either with or without hyposmia. GCB and GCPR are further linked to the GEN-COVID Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR), which includes data from Whole Exome Sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping. The data are available for sharing through the Network for Italian Genomes, within the COVID-19 dedicated section.

335,Severe COVID-19 is associated with elevated serum IgA and antiphospholipid IgA-antibodies,"Background: While the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming increasingly clear, there is little data on IgA response, the first line of bronchial immune defense. Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits. Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS. Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgA-response triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.","Hasan Ali, O.; Bomze, D.; Risch, L.; Brugger, S.

336,Development of a quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip based portable fluorescence smart-phone system for ultrasensitive detection of IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2,"Background: Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been occurred by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The rapid and sensitive immunoassays are urgently demanded for detecting specific antibodies as assistant diagnosis for primary screening of asymptomatic individuals, close contacts,suspected or recovered patients of COIVD-19 during the pandemic period. Methods: The recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) was used as the antigen to detect specific IgM and the mixture of recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) and S-RBD were used to detect specific IgG by the newly designed quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip (QD-LFIA), respectively. Results: A rapid and sensitive QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed for detecting specific IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from 100 serum samples of COVID-19 patients and 450 plasma samples from healthy blood donors. Among 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with NAT previously, 3 were severe, 35 mild and 62 recovered cases. By using QD-LFIA, 78 (78%) and 99 (99%) samples from 100 COVID-19 patients serum were detected positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG, respectively, but only one sample (0.22%) was cross-reactive with S-RBD from 450 healthy blood donor plasmas that were collected from different areas of China. Conclusion: An ultrasensitive and specific QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed fo r detection of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be used for investigating the prevalence or assistant diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans.","Liu, B.; Li, J.; Tang, X.; Wu, Z.; Lu, J.; Liang, C.; Hou, S.; Zhang, L.; Li, T.; Zhao, W.; Fu, Y.; Ke, Y.; Li, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159392v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159392v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
337,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces sustained humoral immune responses in convalescent patients following symptomatic COVID-19,"Long-term antibody responses and neutralizing activities following SARS-CoV-2 infections have not yet been elucidated. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of six months following COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, which were among the first world-wide being infected. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increased rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset were associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlated closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. While specific IgM-S/N became undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers showed an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilized at relatively high levels over the six months observation period. At late time points the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was still over 70%. Taken together, our data indicate sustained humoral immunity in recovered patients who suffer from symptomatic COVID-19, suggesting prolonged immunity.","Wu, J.; Liang, B.; Chen, C.; Wang, H.; Fang, Y.; Shen, S.; Yang, X.; Wang, B.; Chen, L.; Chen, Q.; Wu, Y.; Liu, J.; Yang, X.; Li, W.; Zhu, B.; Zhou, W.; Wang, H.; Li, S.; Lu, S.; Liu, D.; Li, H.; Krawczyk, A.; Lu, M.; Yang, D.; Deng, F.; Dittmer, U.; Trilling, M.; Zheng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159178v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159178v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
338,Comparative Evaluation of 19 Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays for Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemics. To facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various RT-LAMP assays using 19 sets of primers had been developed, but never been compared. We performed comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients. Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and Set-14 (75.9%), and Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (< 8.5 minutes), followed by Set-17 (< 12.5 minutes). Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are determined to be better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) are recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.","Dong, Y.; Wu, X.; Li, S.; Lu, R.; Wan, Z.; Qin, J.; Yu, G.; Jin, X.; Zhang, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159525v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
339,Model-free estimation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics from a complete outbreak,"Background New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. Method We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Findings Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately normally distributed (=5.0 days, {sigma}=5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of cases reduced secondary transmission rates. Interpretation Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

340,Initial Experience in Predicting the Risk of Hospitalization of 496 Outpatients with COVID-19 Using a Telemedicine Risk Assessment Tool,"Objective: To determine whether a risk prediction tool developed and implemented in March 2020 accurately predicts subsequent hospitalizations. Design: Retrospective cohort study, enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020 with follow-up calls until hospitalization or clinical improvement (final calls until June 19, 2020) Setting: Single center telemedicine program managing outpatients from a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia Participants: 496 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in isolation at home. Exclusion criteria included: (1) hospitalization prior to telemedicine program enrollment, (2) immediate discharge with no follow-up calls due to resolution. Exposure: Acute COVID-19 illness Main Outcome and Measures: Hospitalization was the outcome. Days to hospitalization was the metric. Survival analysis using Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with hospitalization. Results: The risk-assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to risk tiers as follows: Tier 1, 237 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 (37.3%); Tier 3, 74 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 (1%), 15 (7%), and 17 (23%) and for Tiers 1-3, respectively. From a Cox regression model with age [&ge;] 60, gender, and self-reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios using Tier 1 as reference were: Tier 2 HR=3.74 (95% CI, 1.06-13.27; P=0.041); Tier 3 HR=10.87 (95% CI, 3.09-38.27; P<0.001). Tier was the strongest predictor of time to hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: A telemedicine risk assessment tool prospectively applied to an outpatient population with COVID-19 identified both low-risk and high-risk patients with better performance than individual risk factors alone. This approach may be appropriate for optimum allocation of resources.","O'Keefe, J. B.; Tong, E. J.; Taylor, T. H.; Datoo O'Keefe, G. D.; Tong, D.

342,Cerebral Microvascular Injury in Severe COVID-19,"IMPORTANCE: Microvascular lesions are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020. SETTING: Single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic deficits. EXPOSURES: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient who died from severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. In 4/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.","Conklin, J.; Frosch, M.

344,Reducing COVID-19 hospitalization risk through behavior change,"Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. We used data (N=444,649) from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with reporting any of the underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to increase risk of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. Risk factors included lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk (PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic. The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible, and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits regarding chronic conditions.","ADAMS, M. L.; Katz, D.

345,Excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy: a two-stage interrupted time series analysis,"Background: Italy was the first country outside China to experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant health burden. This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","Scortichini, M.; Schneider dos Santos, R.; De' Donato, F.; De Sario, M.; Michelozzi, P.; Davoli, M.; Masselot, P.; Sera, F.; Gasparrini, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159632v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159632v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
346,We are at risk too: The disparate impacts of the pandemic on younger generations,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound global impact with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is essential to understand the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviours, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of and changes in COVID-related concerns over time during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two Canadian population-based datasets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N=4,627; March 29-April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Your Mental Health (N=45,989; April 24-May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group, participants self-reported changes in behaviours and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. Results: There are age differences in behavioural responses to the pandemic; adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were stable across groups, while maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger groups. COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behaviour. Results also revealed that anxiety and worry are prevalent in response to the pandemic across all generations, with the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety among Millennials (36.0%). Finally, COVID-related concerns are greatest for younger generations and appear to be decreasing with time.

347,Chronic Hemodialysis Patients have better outcomes with COVID-19 - a retrospective cohort study,"Introduction Several comorbid conditions, have been identified as risk factors in patients with COVID-19. However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. This protective effect, might have a pathophysiologic basis and needs to be further explored.","Naaraayan, A.; Nimkar, A.; Hasan, A.; Pant, S.; Durdevic, M.; Elenius, H.; Nava Suarez, C.; Basak, P.; Lakshmi, K.; Mandel, M.; Jesmajian, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159202v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True

349,High variation expected in the pace and burden of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across sub-Saharan Africa,"A surprising feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date is the low burdens reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries relative to other global regions. Potential explanations (e.g., warmer environments [1], younger populations [2,3,4]) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis accounting for factors that may offset the effects of climate and demography. Here, we synthesize factors hypothesized to shape the pace of this pandemic and its burden as it moves across SSA, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare and intervention capacity, and human mobility dimensions of risk. We find large scale diversity in probable drivers, such that outcomes are likely to be highly variable among SSA countries. While simulation shows that extensive climatic variation among SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories, heterogeneity in connectivity is likely to play a large role in shaping the pace of viral spread. The prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks expected in weakly connected settings may result in extended stress to health systems. In addition, the observed variability in comorbidities and access to care will likely modulate the severity of infection: We show that even small shifts in the infection fatality ratio towards younger ages, which are likely in high risk settings, can eliminate the protective effect of younger populations. We highlight countries with elevated risk of slow pace, high burden outbreaks. Empirical data on the spatial extent of outbreaks within SSA countries, their patterns in severity over age, and the relationship between epidemic pace and health system disruptions are urgently needed to guide efforts to mitigate the high burden scenarios explored here.","Rice, B.

350,COVID-19 Vulnerability of Transgender Women With and Without HIV Infection in the Eastern and Southern U.S.,"Background: COVID-19 is a new global pandemic and people with HIV may be particularly vulnerable. Gender identity is not reported, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including transgender people with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID vulnerability among transgender women. Setting: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC Methods: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect risk for COVID-related harms. Results: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated mistreatment, uncomfortable providers, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. Conclusions: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would have positive effects for everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, T.; Reisner, S.; Miller, M.; Wirtz, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159327v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.20159327v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
351,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, serum inflammatory biomarkers and clinical severity of hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","Background: The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in mediating immunopathogenetic events in COVID-19 patients has been suggested. By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rho=0.79; P=0<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb50 levels in sera collected up to day 30 after the onset of symptoms were comparable between ICU and non-ICU patients (P=>0.1). The percentage of patients who exhibited high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]160) was similar (P=0.20) in ICU (79%) and non-ICU (60%) patients. Four ICU patients died; two of these achieved NtAb50 titers [&ge;]1/160 while the other two exhibited a 1/80 titer. Very weak (Rho=>0.0-<0.2) or weak (Rho=>0.2-<0.4) correlations were observed between anti-RBD IgGs, NtAb50, and serum levels pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

352,"On the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households, schools and the community","Background: There is limited information on the effect of age on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different settings, including primary, secondary and high schools, households, and the whole community. We undertook a literature review of published studies/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, as well as serological studies, and studies of infections in the school setting to examine those issues. Results: Our literature review presents evidence for significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults given the same exposure, for elevated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y compared to younger/middle aged adults, and for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with sleeping close to an infected individual. Published serological studies also suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Additionally, there is some evidence of robust spread of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary/high schools, and there appears to be more limited spread in primary schools. Some countries with relatively large class sizes in primary schools (e.g. Chile and Israel) reported sizeable outbreaks in some of those schools, though routes of transmission of infection to both students and staff are not clear from current reports. Conclusions: Opening secondary/high schools is likely to contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and, if implemented, it should require both lower levels of community transmission and greater safeguards to reduce transmission. Compared to secondary/high schools, opening primary schools and daycare facilities may have a more limited effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, particularly under smaller class sizes and in the presence of mitigation measures. Efforts to avoid crowding in the classroom and other mitigation measures should be implemented, to the extent possible, when opening primary schools. Efforts should be undertaken to diminish the mixing in younger adults to mitigate the spread of the epidemic in the whole community.","Goldstein, E.; Lipsitch, M.; Cevik, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157362v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.19.20157362v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
353,Herd immunity thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 estimated from unfolding epidemics,"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation declines causing the rate at which new infections occur to slow down. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R_0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+CV^2 ) )) or 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+2CV^2 ) )), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R_0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-1/R_0 , remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.","Aguas, R.; Corder, R.

354,Lifting mobility restrictions and the induced short-term dynamics of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 has now infected 15 million people and produced more than six hundred thousand deaths around the world. Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social-distancing measures and confinement with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far to many cities around the world rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateau-like states have appeared where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model describes too, the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","Santana-Cibrian, M.; Acuna-Zegarra, M.

355,Country distancing reveals the effectiveness of travel restrictions during COVID-19,"Travel restrictions are the current central strategy to globally stop the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restriction's effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4 are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide. Instead, by imposing Hubei's lockdown on Jan-23 and national lockdown on Feb-8, mainland China alone leads to 11.66 [95% credible interval (CI), 9.71 to 13.92] days of ATD per geographic area and 1,012,233 (95% CI, 208,210 -4,959,094) ICR in total as of Apr-4. Our result unveils the trade-off between the country distancing increase and economic loss, offering practical guidance for strategic action about when and where to implement travel restrictions, tailed to the real-time national context.","Zhong, L.; Diagne, M.; Wang, W.; Gao, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20160994v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20160994v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
356,Strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-introduction from international travellers,"To mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risks from international travellers, many countries currently use a combination of up to 14 days of self-quarantine on arrival and testing for active infection. We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.","Clifford, S.; Quilty, B.

357,Cell type-specific immune dysregulation in severely ill COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become the most serious pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic. In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","Yao, C.; Bora, S.

358,Mathematical modelling of dynamics and containment of COVID-19 in Ukraine,"COVID-19 disease caused by the novel SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus has already brought unprecedented challenges for public health and resulted in huge numbers of cases and deaths worldwide. In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role for forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","Kyrychko, Y.; Blyuss, K.; Brovchenko, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161497v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True

This statistically significant weekly component has been identified in 76% of the countries examined in Europe, 66% in North America, 71% in South America, and 18% in Asia. The range of this rhythmic component is low at the growth stage and increases at the stabilization and decrease stages. The weekly phases feature shifting peaks depending on the country. In some cases, the phases shift, i.e. they are not limited strictly to certain days of the week. Due to range and phase variation, its explanation cannot be limited to strictly medical and social factors. In some cases, national incidence dynamics includes 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10-day periods.

361,Distributional challenges regarding data on death and incidences during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to July 2020,"COVID-19 is a major global crisis with unpredictable consequences. Many scientists have struggled to make forecasts about its impact. Especially, appropriate preparations for a second wave are needed not to move in a costly panic mode again. It is necessary to get ideas about worst case scenarios regarding incidences, hospitalization, or use of ICU resources. They can be described in terms of extreme quantiles (95%, 99%, 99.9%) of specific distributions that supposedly formalize the data mechanism behind future observations. Therefore, distributional issues do matter. Cirillo and Taleb argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing and managing real risk in pandemics is provided by extreme value theory dealing with extrema and not averages. We explore this idea in more detail. In this paper we discuss the fat-tail patterns in the distribution of the global COVID-19 data by analyzing data from 66 countries worldwide. We also explore their relevance at a lower, regional scale perspective (national, federal state), which is in our opinion more relevant for planning measures against the epidemic spread. For this we analyze data from the German federal state of Bavaria. We conclude that fat-tail patterns are seen in global data, possibly reflecting the respective heterogeneity between different countries regarding incidences and fatalities during the ongoing epidemic. However, the disease activity at regional level seems to be better described by classical Poisson based models. To bridge the gap between regional and global phenomena we refer to mixtures of slim-tail distributions that may create fat-tail features. Especially in the beginning of a pandemic acting according to the ""better safe than sorry"" principle and taking extreme forecasts as the basis for the decisions might be justified. However, as the pandemic continues and control measures are partially lifted, there is a need for a careful discussion how to choose relevant distributions and their respective quantiles for future resource planning in order not to cause more harm as the pandemic itself.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.20161257v1?rss=1,2020-07-24,2020-07-24,,True
362,Overweight/obesity as the potentially most important lifestyle factor associated with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19,"Objective The occurrence of pneumonia separates severe cases of COVID-19 from the majority of cases with mild disease. However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients (n=201). Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29 - 5.59) p=0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","Sacco, V.; Rauch, B.; Gar, C.; Haschka, S.; Potzel, A.

We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.","An, X.; Martinez, M.

366,Rapid in vitro assays for screening neutralizing antibodies and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2,"Towards the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (CoV) named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, and has been responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our MNA is compatible with HTS settings to interrogate large and/or complex libraries of mAbs and/or antivirals to identify those with neutralizing and/or antiviral activity, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2.","Oark, J.-G.; Oladduni, F.

367,Transcriptional response modules characterise IL-1 and IL-6 activity in COVID-19,"Dysregulated IL-1 and IL-6 responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1 and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1 or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis, and discerns the effect of therapeutic cytokine blockade in JIA. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1 and IL-6 response modules, but not these cytokines per se, is a feature of disease both in blood and in affected organs. We propose that IL-1 and IL-6 transcriptional response modules can provide a dynamic readout of the activity of these cytokine pathways in vivo, with potential applications for identifying COVID-19 patients who may benefit from IL-1 or IL-6 blocking therapy, and to aid quantification of the biological effects of these treatments.","Bell, L.

368,SARS-CoV2 genome analysis of Indian isolates and molecular modelling of D614G mutated spike protein with TMPRSS2 depicted its enhanced interaction and virus infectivity,"COVID-19 that emerged as a global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","Raghav, S.; Ghosh, A.; Turuk, J.; Kumar, S.; Jha, A.; Madhulika, S.; Priyadarshini, M.; Biswas, V.

In March 2020, four tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo developed mild respiratory signs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in respiratory secretions and/or feces from all seven affected animals; viral RNA and/or antibodies were detected in their keepers. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from respiratory secretions or feces from three affected animals; in situ hybridization co-localized viral RNA with cellular damage. Whole genome sequence and haplotype network analyses showed tigers and lions were infected with two different SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting independent viral introductions. The source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lions is unknown.

In the light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. We showed that ACE2 is indeed present in human pancreatic islets, where is preferentially expressed by insulin producing {beta}-cells. Of note, pro-inflammatory cytokines increased ACE2 expression in {beta}-cells, thus putatively suggesting an enhancement of {beta}-cells sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 during inflammatory conditions. Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes, through direct {beta}-cell virus tropism.

DESIGN: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care. SETTING: Hospital Universitario Cruces, a tertiary level University hospital at Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between 1st March and 30th April 2020 to the services of Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with week-2-MP (125-250 mg/d for 3 consecutive days with no subsequent tapering) vs. standard of care. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Time to death and time to death or endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers at admission were included in the study. Sixty-one patients (25%) received week-2-MP. Twenty-two patients (9%) died during the study period. Thirty-one patients (12.8%) suffered death or intubation. The adjusted HR for death was 0.35 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.06, p= 0.064) for patients in the week-2-MP group. The adjusted HR for death or intubation week-2-MP was 0.33 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.84, p=0.020) for patients in the week-2-MP group. These differences were seen in the subcohort of patients with a SaO2/FiO2 at day 7 lower than the median of the whole population: HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12, p=0.073 and HR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.94, p=0.038, respectively, but not in patients with higher SaO2/FiO2. Other predictors of the final outcomes were arterial hypertension, SaO2/FiO2, high-risk CURB65 scores and the use of non-pulse glucocorticoids. Non-pulse glucocorticoids were a predictor of infections (OR 4.72, 95%CI 1.90 to 11.80, p<0.001), while week-2-MP were not (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.40 to 2.70, p=0.938). CONCLUSIONS: Week-2-MP are effective in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with features of inflammatory activity and respiratory deterioration entering the second week of disease. The recognition of this high-risk population should prompt early use of MP at this point.

373,Oral delivery of SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccines using attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a carrier in rat,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the disease that has been identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation. The effective delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids to the immune systems inductive cells constitutes an essential requirement for the generation of effective DNA vaccines. Here, we have explored the use of Salmonella typhimurium as vehicles to deliver expression plasmids orally. Attenuated Salmonella phoP harboring eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was administered orally to Wistar rats. Rats were immunized orally with Salmonella that carried a eukaryotic expression plasmid once a week for three consecutive weeks. The efficiency of the vaccination procedure was due to the transfer of the expression plasmid from the bacterial carrier to the mammalian host. Evidence for such an event could be obtained in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that all immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating that a Salmonella-based vaccine carrying the Spike gene can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Yang, D.; Zhu, D.; Meng, Y.; Qimuge, A.; Bilige, B.; Baiyin, T.; Temuqile, T.; Chen, S.; Borjigen, S.; Baigude, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217174v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.217174v1?rss=1,2020-07-23,2020-07-23,,False
374,Development and validation of a clinical risk score to predict the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from administrative data: a population-based cohort study from Italy,"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic spread rapidly worldwide increasing exponentially in Italy. To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates.

MethodsRetrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsSubjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1).

ConclusionThis study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

375,"The new silicone N99 half-piece respirator, VJR-NMU N99: A novel and effective tool to prevent COVID-19","Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex(R) test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new N99 respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of N99 over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators.. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trakarnvanich, T.; Manomaipiboon, A.; Pupipatpab, S.; Chomdee, P.

Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred. Conclusion: Data from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.","LOFGREN, S. M. M.; Nicol, M.

379,FDA approved calcium channel blockers inhibit SARS CoV 2 infectivity in epithelial lung cells,"Covid-19 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide causing over 600.000 deaths1. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares a high sequence similarity to SARS CoV2. Currently there are no vaccinations available to provide protection and the only antiviral therapy in active use in patients is remdesivir, which currently provides only limited benefit3. Hence, there is an urgent need for antiviral therapies against SARS CoV 2. SARS CoV requires Ca2+ ions for host cell entry4 and based on the similarity between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 25 it is highly likely that the same requirements exist for the two viruses. Here, we tested whether FDA-approved calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs are efficacious to inhibit the spread of SARS CoV 2 in cell culture. Our data shows that amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine limit the growth of SARS CoV 2 in epithelial kidney (Vero E6) and epithelial lung (Calu-3) cells. We observed some differences in the inhibition efficacy of the drugs in the two different cell lines, but with felodopine and nifedipine having the greatest effect.

380,Neonatal hyperoxia enhances age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice,"The severity of COVID-19 lung disease is higher in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities. People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) between postnatal days 0-4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","Yee, M.; Cohen, E.

381,Rescue of SARS-CoV-2 from a single bacterial artificial chromosome,"An infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in the city of Wuhan (China) in December 2019, causing a pandemic that has dramatically impacted public health and socioeconomic activities worldwide. A previously unknown coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To date, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has triggered a large influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have developed an infectious cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).

Recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 was readily rescued by transfection of the BAC into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, the BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those of the SARS-CoV-2 natural isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed similar levels of replication to that of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs of infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC based reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2 that displays similar features in vivo to that of a natural viral isolate. This SARS-CoV-2 BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing several important questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of antivirals and development of vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.","Ye, C.; Park, J.-G.; Oladunni, F.; Platt, R.

382,Escape from neutralizing antibodies by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants,"Neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or vaccination are likely to be key for future protection of individuals and populations against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.","Weisblum, Y.; Schmidt, F.; Zhang, F.; DaSilva, J.; Poston, D.; Lorenzi, J.

383,The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein increases infectivity in an ACE2 receptor dependent manner,"The SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic has been reported to have a relatively low mutation rate. Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.","Ogawa, J.; Zhu, W.; Tonnu, N.; Singer, O.; Hunter, T.; Ryan (Firth), A.

384,The effect of border controls on the risk of COVID-19 reincursion from international arrivals,"In an attempt to maintain elimination of COVID-19, the New Zealand government has closed the border to everyone except citizens and residents. All arrivals are required to spend 14 days in government-managed isolation/quarantine and to be tested for COVID-19 on day 3 and on day 12 of their stay. We model the testing, isolation and potential transmission of COVID-19 within managed isolation facilities to estimate the risk of undetected cases and the risk of infectious cases being released into the community. We use a stochastic individual-based that includes a time-dependent probability of a false negative test result, complete isolation of confirmed and probable cases, and secondary transmission of COVID-19 between close contacts. We show that the combination of 14-day quarantine with day 3 and day 12 testing reduces risk of releasing an infectious case to around 0.1% per infected arrival. Shorter quarantine periods, or reliance on testing only with no quarantine, substantially increase this risk. It is important to avoid contacts between individuals staying in quarantine to minimise the risk of secondary transmission. We calculate the ratio of cases detected on day 3 to cases detected on day 12 in the model and show that this may be a useful indicator of the likelihood of secondary transmission occurring within quarantine. We do not explicitly model transmission of COVID-19 from individuals in quarantine to staff, but this is likely to present a significant risk. This needs to be minimised by strict infection control, use of personal protective equipment by staff at all times, and avoiding close contact between staff and hotel guests.","Steyn, N.; Binny, R.

385,"Inadequate level of knowledge, mixed outlook and poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention guideline among Ethiopians","COVID-19 has a potential to cause chaos in Ethiopia due to the countrys already daunting economic and social challenges. Living and working conditions are highly conducive for transmission, as people live in crowded inter-generational households that often lack running water and other basic sanitary facilities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of Ethiopians toward COVID-19 following the introduction of state of emergency by the Ethiopian government to curb the spread of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was conducted in nine reginal states and two chartered cities. Data for demographic, Knowledge, attitude and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through telephone interview from 1570 participants. Descriptive and bivariate analyses using chi-square test, t-test or analysis of variance were performed as appropriate. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to measure the relationship between the categorical dependent variables and one or more socio-demographic independent variables with two-tailed at =0.05 significance level and 95% of confidence interval. The level of good knowledge, favourable attitude and good practice among the respondents were 42%, 53.8% and 24.3% respectively. Being rural resident, older than 50 years, having at least primary education, being resident of Amhara and Oromia regions were independent predictors of knowledge level. While being rural resident, married, employed, having at least basic education, being residents of Afar, Amhara, Gambela, Oromia and Somali regions were found to be the best predictors of the attitude, being rural resident, government employee, having at least basic education, and living outside of the capital were the independent predictors of practice level of the respondents. The finding revealed that Ethiopians have inadequate level of knowledge and are generally have a mixed outlook on overcoming the pandemic with poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention practice. reinforcing preventive measures and intensifying sensitization campaigns to fill the knowledge gap and persuading people to follow the preventive measures set by the government with concurrent evaluation of the impacts of these measures on knowledge and practice is highly recommended to mitigate the disease.","Negera, E.; Demissie, T.

The unavailability of a specific treatment regime and a candidate vaccine yet opens up scope for new approaches and discoveries of drugs for mitigation of the sufferings of humankind due to the disease. The present isolated whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 11 different nations subjected to evolutionary study and genome-wide association study through in silico approaches including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic study through MEGA7 and have been analyzed through DNAsp respectively. These investigations recognized the nucleotide varieties and single nucleotide mutations/polymorphisms on the genomic regions as well as protein-coding regions. The resulted mutations have diversified the genomic contents of SARS-CoV-2 according to the altered nucleotides found in 11 genome sequences. India and Nepal have found to have progressively more distinct species of SARS-CoV-2 with variations in Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein-coding sites. These genomic variations might be the explanation behind the less case fatality rate of India and Nepal dependent on the populaces.

387,The discovery of a recombinant SARS2-like CoV strain provides insights into SARS and COVID-2019 pandemics,"In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the present study, we classified betacoronavirus subgroup B into the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoV clusters, and the ORF8 genes of these three clusters into types 1, 2 and 3, respectively. One important result of our study is that the recently reported strain RmYN02 was identified as a recombinant SARS2-like CoV strain that belongs to the SARS-CoV-2 cluster, but has an ORF8 from a SARS-like CoV. This result provides substantial proof for long-existing hypotheses regarding the recombination and biological functions of ORF8. Based on the analysis of recombination events in the Spike gene, we propose that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may have more than one specific receptor for its function as gp120 of HIV has CD4 and CCR5. We concluded that the furin protease cleavage site acquired by SARS-CoV-2 may increase the efficiency of viral entry into cells, while the type 2 ORF8 acquired by SARS-CoV may increase its replication efficiency. These two most critical events provide the most likely explanation for SARS and COVID-2019 pandemics.","Li, X.; Jin, X.; Chen, S.; Wang, L.; Yau, T.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, which is mediated by the viral spike protein and host ACE2 receptor, is an essential target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and drugs. Using a mammalian cell expression system, we generated a recombinant fluorescent protein (Gamillus)-fused SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (STG) to probe the viral entry process. In ACE2-expressing cells, we found that the STG probe has excellent performance in the live-cell visualization of receptor binding, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 under virus-free conditions. The new system allows quantitative analyses of the inhibition potentials and detailed influence of COVID-19-convalescent human plasmas, neutralizing antibodies and compounds, providing a versatile tool for high-throughput screening and phenotypic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.

389,Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry is attenuated by TMPRSS2,"Hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria and some autoimmune disorders, potently inhibits viral infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell-culture studies. However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.

Author SummaryThe novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and remains a threat to global public health. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to prevent viral infection in cell-culture systems, but human clinical trials did not observe a significant improvement in COVID-19 patients treated with these compounds. Here we show that hydroxychloroquine interferes with only one of two somewhat redundant pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is activated to mediate infection. The first pathway is dependent on the endosomal protease cathepsin L and sensitive to hydroxychloroquine, whereas the second pathway is dependent on TMPRSS2, which is unaffected by this compound. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 is more reliant than SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) on the TMPRSS2 pathway, and that this difference is due to a furin cleavage site present in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Finally, we show that combinations of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor work together to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry. Thus TMPRSS2 expression on physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 target cells may bypass the antiviral activities of hydroxychloroquine, and explain its lack of in vivo efficacy.","Ou, T.; Mou, H.; Zhang, L.; Ojha, A.; Choe, H.; Farzan, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.216150v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.216150v1?rss=1,2020-07-22,2020-07-22,,False
390,Evaluation of a novel multiplexed assay for determining IgG levels and functional activity to SARS-CoV-2.,"BackgroundThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of new serological assays that could aid in diagnosis and evaluation of seroprevalence to inform an understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease. Many available tests lack rigorous evaluation and therefore results may be misleading.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay.

MethodsA multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019.

ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with a specificity of 97.4% and sensitivity of 96.2% for samples taken 14 days and 97.9% for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-neutralisation assay.

ConclusionExcellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay which can also measure antibody functionality.","Johnson, M.; Wagstaffe, H.; Gilmour, K.

Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species except mouse to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing spike protein derived from either the bat raTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 Spike displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Strikingly, insertion of PRRA into the raTG13 Spike selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but conferred usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13 spike proteins.","Liu, S.; Selvaraj, P.; Lien, C.; Wu, W.

392,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through cGAS-STING and NF-κB,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic. In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-{kappa}B and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-{kappa}B response is mediated by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-{kappa}B driven inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to suppress severe disease symptoms.","Neufeldt, C.

Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His8, the C-terminus with His8-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the HEK293 Flp-In TREx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins and quantified by western blot. A few fusion proteins were poorly expressed, whereas others, including Nsp1, Nsp12, and N protein, were toxic unless care was taken to minimize background expression.

395,S protein-reactive IgG and memory B cell production after human SARS-CoV-2 infection includes broad reactivity to the S2 subunit,"The high susceptibility of humans to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19, reflects the novelty of the virus and limited preexisting B cell immunity. IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and PBMCs from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBCs. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 in convalescent subjects were higher than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.

IMPORTANCERecent rapid worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has established a pandemic of potentially serious disease in the highly susceptible human population. Key questions are whether humans have preexisting immune memory that provides some protection against SARS-CoV-2 and whether SARS-CoV-2 infection generates lasting immune protection against reinfection. Our analysis focused on pre- and post-infection IgG and IgG memory B cells (MBCs) reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most importantly, we demonstrate that infection generates both IgG and IgG MBCs against the novel receptor binding domain and the conserved S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Thus, even if antibody levels wane, long-lived MBCs remain to mediate rapid antibody production. Our study also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection strengthens preexisting broad coronavirus protection through S2-reactive antibody and MBC formation.","Nguyen-Contant, P.; Embong, A.

396,"Cellular events of acute, resolving or progressive COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates","We investigated the immune events following SARS-COV-2 infection, from the acute inflammatory state up to four weeks post infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with heterogeneous pulmonary pathology. The acute phase was characterized by a rapid migration of CD16+ monocytes from the blood and concomitant increase in CD16+ macrophages in the lungs. We identified two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA- DR+ CD206-), a transitional CD11c+ CD16+ population that was directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and one long lasting CD11b+ CD16+ population. Strikingly, monocytes were a correlate of viral replication in bronchial brushes and levels of TARC (CCL17), and worse disease outcomes were associated with high levels of cell infiltration in lungs and CD11b+ CD16+ macrophages accumulation. Importantly, this accumulation was long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with less signs of disease had a high IL-10:IL-6 ratio. Our results unravel cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 and validate NHP as models to test immune therapies.","Fahlberg, M. D.; Blair, R. V.; Doyle-Meyers, L. A.; Midkiff, C.

397,THE ORIGIN OF A NEW HUMAN VIRUS: PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF SARS-COV-2,"ObjectivesDuring the first months of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a new host, contrasting hypotheses have been proposed about the way the virus has evolved and diversified worldwide. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsThe molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.

ResultsAll observed phylogenetic signals were very low and consistent trees were obtained. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to range from 1.37 to 2.19 x 10-3 substitution/site/year.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understanding essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow identifying the best targets for antiviral treatments and vaccines development.","Pereson, M. J.; Mojsiejczuk, L.; Martinez, A. P.; Flichman, D. M.; Garcia, G.

398,Multi-site co-mutations and 5'UTR CpG immunity escape drive the evolution of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the caused mortalities have been surging since the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral mutations emerge during the virus circulating in the population, which is shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we extensively analyzed 6698 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences with specific sample collection dates in NCBI database. We found that four mutations, i.e., 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, NSP12_c-14408-t, and S_a-23403-g, became the dominant variants and each of them represented nearly 100% of all virus sequences since the middle May, 2020. Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively. Moreover, we found significant decrease of CpG dinucleotide at positions 241(c)-242(g) in the 5UTR during the evolution, which was verified as a potential target of human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The four dominant mutations, three significant multi-site co-mutations, and the potential escape mutation of ZAP-target in 5UTR region contribute to the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, thus shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. This study provides valuable clues and frameworks to dissect the viral replication and virus-host interactions for designing effective therapeutics.

399,Implications of the COVID-19 lockdown on dengue transmission and the occurrence of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in Malaysia,"The impact of movement restrictions (MRs) during the COVID-19 lockdown on the existing endemic infectious disease dengue fever has generated considerable research interest. We compared the curve of weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no MRs and found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes, we proposed a stronger diffusive effect of vector dispersal that led to a higher rate of transmission. From the result of the Aedes survey using human landing caught (HLC), we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments, with the abundance increasing steadily during the period of lockdown. We only recovered Aedes aegypti from the indoor environment, which is relatively fewer than Ae. albopictus, by contrasting their population growth, which suggested that Ae. albopictus invaded and colonized the habitat of Ae. aegypti during the period of lockdown. These findings would help authorities review the direction and efforts of the vector control strategy.

Author summaryCOVID-19 pandemic is taking hold globally and dengue fever transmission is not on the top of the list of concerns. With a partial lockdown implemented by Malaysia on 18 March, we postulate the movement restrictions (MRs) of people in large-scale would hamper the regular dengue transmission and aim to reveal the impact of MRs on both dengue incidences and Aedes mosquitoes. We showed a significant decline of dengue incidences at the beginning of lockdown but later rebounded at an earlier time and higher rate compared to the corresponding period of previous years. Our result also reviews how adaptive the Ae. albopictus with the movement of the host, as the human contained in the house, the abundance of the mosquitoes increased significantly during the period of lockdown. We also suggest that Ae. albopictus could be the key substitution vector that contributes significantly to dengue virus circulation, and therefore, the vector control direction and strategies should be redesigned.","Ong, S.-Q.; Ahmad, H.; Mohd.

The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish an exhaustive high-resolution map of blood antigen-presenting cells (APC) in 7 COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe pneumonia, at day-1 and day-4 post-admission, and two healthy donors. We generated a unique dataset of 31,513 high quality APC, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multiprocess and previously unrecognized defects in anti-viral immune defense in specific APC compartments from severe patients: i) increase of pro-apoptotic genes exclusively in pDC, which are key effectors of antiviral immunity, ii) sharp decrease of innate sensing receptors, TLR7 and DHX9, in pDC and cDC1, respectively, iii) down-regulation of antiviral effector molecules, including Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in all monocyte subsets, and iv) decrease of MHC class II-related genes, and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) activity in cDC2, suggesting a viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore defective immune defense.","Saichi, M.; Ladjemi, M.

Sporadic detection of natural cases in animals alongside successful experimental infections of pets, such as cats, ferrets and dogs, raises questions about the susceptibility of animals under natural conditions of pet ownership. Here we report a large-scale study to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection in 817 companion animals living in northern Italy, sampled at a time of frequent human infection. No animals tested PCR positive. However, 3.4% of dogs and 3.9% of cats had measurable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, with dogs from COVID-19 positive households being significantly more likely to test positive than those from COVID-19 negative households. Understanding risk factors associated with this and their potential to infect other species requires urgent investigation.

Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism of these drugs by combining experiments and simulations. In vitro assays confirm the hypothesis that both drugs act by inhibiting the human protein TMPRSS2. As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the TMPRSS2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 280 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and Markov modeling. We describe the binding mode of both drugs with TMPRSS2 in a Michaelis complex (MC) state preceding the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat to has a higher MC population, which in turn leads to the more frequent formation of the covalent complex and thus higher inhibition efficacy, as confirmed in vitro and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays. Our TMPRSS2-drug structures are made public to guide the design of more potent and specific inhibitors.","Hempel, T.; Raich, L.; Olsson, S.; Azouz, N. P.; Klingler, A. M.; Rothenberg, M.

403,Intranasal Immunization with a Lentiviral Vector Coding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Confers Vigorous Protection in Pre-Clinical Animal Models,"We developed a potent vaccination strategy, based on lentiviral vector (LV), capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies specific to the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among several LV encoding distinct variants of S, a single one encoding the full-length, membrane anchored S (LV::SFL) triggered high antibody titers in mice, with neutralization activities comparable to patients recovered from COVID-19. LV::SFL systemic vaccination in mice, in which the expression of the CoV2 receptor hACE2 was induced by transduction of the respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral type 5 (Ad5) vector, despite an intense serum neutralizing activity, only {approx}1 log10 reduction of lung viral loads was observed after SARS-CoV2 challenge.

We thus explored the strategy of targeting the immune response to the upper respiratory tract through an intranasal boost administration. Even though, after a prime and target regimen, the systemic neutralizing activity did not increase substantially, {approx}5 log10 decrease in lung viral loads was achieved, with the loads in some animals under the limit of detection of a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay. The conferred protection also avoided largely pulmonary inflammation.

We confirmed the vaccine efficacy and inhibition of lung inflammation using both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms in golden hamsters, naturally permissive to SARS-CoV2 replication and restituting human COVID-19 physiopathology.

A pertinent and recent example where such strategy could be employed is in the fight against COVID-19. Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA approved antiviral compounds including Remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA(R)) coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in non-infected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners as well as in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability.

406,De novo design of modular and tunable allosteric biosensors,"Naturally occurring allosteric protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","Quijano-Rubio, A.; Yeh, H.-W.; Park, J.; Lee, H.; Langan, R.

However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases, including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions and time spans.

To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low/- regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells.

409,Probing the dynamic structure-function and structure-free energy relationships of the corona virus main protease with Biodynamics theory,"The SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro) is of major interest as an anti-viral drug target. Structure-based virtual screening efforts, fueled by a growing list of apo and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV/CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures, are underway in many labs. However, little is known about the dynamic enzyme mechanism, which is needed to inform both structure-based design and assay development. Here, we apply Biodynamics theory to characterize the structural dynamics of substrate-induced Mpro activation, and explore the implications thereof for efficacious inhibition under non-equilibrium conditions. The catalytic cycle (including tetrahedral intermediate formation and hydrolysis) is governed by concerted dynamic structural rearrangements of domain 3 and the m-shaped loop (residues 132-147) on which Cys145 (comprising the thiolate nucleophile and one-half of the oxyanion hole) and Gly143 reside (comprising the other half of the oxyanion hole).

To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation. To understand current limitations, we applied cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Ribosolve7 pipeline to determine a three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, validated through an RNA nanostructure tagging method. This is the smallest macromolecule (88 nt; 28 kDa) resolved by single-particle cryo-EM at subnanometer resolution to date. The tertiary structure model, defined to an estimated accuracy of 5.9 [A], presents a topologically complex fold in which the 5' end threads through a ring formed inside a three-stem pseudoknot. Our results suggest an updated model for SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting as well as binding sites that may be targeted by next generation ASOs and small molecules.","Zhang, K.; Zheludev, I. N.; Hagey, R.

411,The folate antagonist methotrexate diminishes replication of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and enhances the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture models,"The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.

SIGNIFICANCEO_LIMTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit {euro} or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions.
C_LIO_LIAdditional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2
C_LIO_LIRemdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone.
C_LIO_LICOVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.

412,In silico comparative genomics of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the source and diversity of the pathogen in Bangladesh,"The COVID19 pandemic has originated in China, immobilized the whole world including Bangladesh. Herein using whole-genome sequencing data of 64 COVID 19 viruses from Bangladesh, we tried to predict the possible viral transmission route to Bangladesh and divergence among theses sequences. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen arrived in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The virus of Chattogram was found to be originated from Saudi Arabia but Dhaka was infected with the viruses from the United Kingdom and France. The total 64 sequences of Bangladesh generate three clusters. Besides, 180 mutations were present in the coding regions of these viruses, and 110 of them were missense. Among the missense mutations 99 were predicted to destabilize the protein structures. Specifically a mutation at NSP2 1163A>T (I300F) was highly prevalent in Bangladeshi sequences and predicted to have a destabilizing effect on NSP2, which modulates host cell survival strategy.","Ahmed, T.

413,The short and long-range RNA-RNA Interactome of SARS-CoV-2,"The Coronaviridae are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and its subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome adopts alternative topologies inside cells and undergoes genome cyclization. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Most importantly, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch - that encircles the programmed ribosomal frame-shifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV virus and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","Ziv, O.; Price, J.; Shalamova, L.; Kamenova, T.; Goodfellow, I.; Weber, F.; Miska, E.

414,SARS-CoV2 spike protein displays biologically significant similarities with paramyxovirus surface proteins; a bioinformatics study,"Recent emergence of SARS-CoV2 and associated COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge for the scientific community. Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology, virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This  spike-fusion homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spikes T cell epitopes as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region. Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.","Ahmadi, E.; Zabihi, M.

415,A human disease model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and immune responses with a microengineered organ chip,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seriously endangers human health. There is an urgent need to build physiological relevant human models for deep understanding the complex organ-level disease processes and facilitating effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we first report the use of microengineered alveolus chip to create a human disease model of lung injury and immune responses induced by native SARS-CoV-2 at organ-level. This biomimetic system is able to reconstitute the key features of human alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells under microfluidic flow. The epithelial cells on chip showed higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells identified by viral spike protein expression. Transcriptional analysis showed distinct responses of two cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including activated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway in epithelium and activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in endothelium. Notably, in the presence of circulating immune cells, a series of alveolar pathological changes were observed, including the detachment of endothelial cells, recruitment of immune cells, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta} and TNF-). These new findings revealed a crucial role of immune cells in mediating lung injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with antiviral compound remdesivir could suppress viral copy and alleviate the disruption of alveolar barrier integrity induced by viral infection. This bioengineered human organ chip system can closely mirror human-relevant lung pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, not possible by other in vitro models, which provides a promising and alternative platform for COVID-19 research and preclinical trials.","Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Li, Z.; Guo, Y.; Yao, Y.; Li, M.; Tao, T.; Chen, W.; Han, J.; Liu, H.; Cui, K.; Zhang, X.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211789v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,False
416,Computational optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-motif affinity for human ACE2,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the closely related SARS-CoV coronavirus enter cells by binding at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.","Polydorides, S.; Archontis, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212068v1?rss=1,2020-07-20,2020-07-20,,False
417,Interferons and viruses induce a novel primate-specific isoform dACE2 and not the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells. ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, primate-specific isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 N-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results reconcile current knowledge on ACE2 expression and suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to affect the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.","Onabajo, O.

Herein, we analysed 173 sequences isolated from Indian patients and performed SNP linkage, clustering and phylogenetic analysis to understand the local genetic diversity. We found that the SNP linkages that lead to the identification of some global clades, do not hold true for the local clade classification. In addition to the unique cluster, established by another Indian study, we identified a new cluster (I-20D) that encompasses 28% of the analysed sequences. This cluster is defined by two linked variations - C22444T and C28854T. A detailed study of such polymorphisms can be useful for drug and vaccine development.","Das, D.; Akkipeddi, V. S. S. N.

419,"Evaluation of diversity levels in HIV-1 virus integrase gene sequences, supporting the lack of target specificity of ivermectin versus the integrase-importin complex in SARS-CoV-2 infection","Therapies with new drugs have been appearing in tests worldwide as potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 virus replication. Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin, was reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon becoming the target of an international prospecting work (not yet published), with patients tested for COVID-19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, SARS-CoV-2 and the functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.","Felix, P.

420,An autocrine Vitamin D-driven Th1 shutdown program can be exploited for COVID-19,"Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-{gamma}-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5-7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","McGregor, R.; Chauss, D.; Freiwald, T.; Yan, B.; Wang, L.; Nova-Lamperti, E.; Zhang, Z.; Teague, H.; West, E.; Bibby, J.; Kelly, A.; Malik, A.; Freeman, A.; Schwartz, D.; Portilla, D.; John, S.; Lavender, P.; Lionakis, M.

Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) by the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18 hACE2) represent a susceptible rodent model. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 6, with virus detected in lung airway epithelium and brain. K18 ACE2-transgenic mice produced a modest TH1/2/17 cytokine storm in the lung and spleen that peaked by day 2, and an extended chemokine storm that was detected in both lungs and brain. This chemokine storm was also detected in the brain at day 4. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice are, therefore, highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and represent a suitable animal model for the study of viral pathogenesis, and for identification and characterization of vaccines (prophylactic) and antivirals (therapeutics) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated severe COVID-19 disease.","Oladunni, F.; Park, J.-G.; Pino Tamayo, P.; Gonzalez, O.; Ahkter, A.; Allue Guardia, A.; Olmo-Fontanez, A.; Gautam, S.; Garcia Vilanova, A.; Ye, C.; Chiem, K.; Headley, C.; Dwivedi, V.; Parodi, L.; Alfson, K.; Staples, H.; Schami, A.; Garcia, J.; Whigham, A.; Platt, R.

The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease has been implicated in virus maturation, dysregulation of host inflammation and antiviral immune responses. We showed that PLpro preferably cleaves the K48-ubiquitin linkage while also being capable of cleaving ISG15 modification. The multiple functions of PLpro render it a promising drug target. Therefore, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and also examined available inhibitors against PLpro. Inhibitor GRL0617 showed a promising IC50 of 2.1 M. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-C111S in complex with GRL0617 suggests that GRL0617 is a non-covalent inhibitor. NMR data indicate that GRL0617 blocks the binding of ISG15 to PLpro.

423,The landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications,"In 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.","Miladi, M.; Fuchs, J.; Maier, W.; Weigang, S.; Diaz i Pedrosa, N.; Weiss, L.; Lother, A.; Nekrutenko, A.; Ruzsics, Z.; Panning, M.; Kochs, G.; Gilsbach, R.; Gruening, B.

424,Interplay of Monocytes and T Lymphocytes in COVID-19 Severity,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents an ongoing global crisis that has already impacted over 13 million people. The responses of specific immune cell populations to the disease remain poorly defined, which hinders improvements in treatment and care management. Here, we utilized mass cytometry (CyTOF) to thoroughly phenotype peripheral myeloid cells and T lymphocytes from 30 convalescent patients with mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19. We identified 10 clusters of monocytes and dendritic cells and 17 clusters of T cells. Examination of these clusters revealed that both CD14+CD16+ intermediate and CD14dimCD16+ nonclassical monocytes, as well as CD4+ stem cell memory T (TSCM) cells, correlated with COVID-19 severity, coagulation factor levels, and/or inflammatory indicators. We also identified two nonclassical monocyte subsets distinguished by expression of the sugar residue 6-Sulfo LacNac (Slan). One of these subsets (Slanlo, nMo1) was depleted in moderately and severely ill patients, while the other (Slanhi, nMo2) increased with disease severity and was linked to CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cell frequencies, coagulation factors, and inflammatory indicators. Intermediate monocytes tightly correlated with loss of naive T cells as well as an increased abundance of effector memory T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our data suggest that both intermediate and non-classical monocyte subsets shape the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides both broad and in-depth characterization of immune cell phenotypes in response to COVID-19 and suggests functional interactions between distinct cell types during the disease.

425,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein hijacks VEGF-A/Neuropilin-1 receptor signaling to induce analgesia,"Global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues unabated. Binding of SARS-CoV-2s Spike protein to host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 triggers viral entry, but other proteins may participate, including neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1). As both Spike protein and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) - a pronociceptive and angiogenic factor, bind NRP-1, we tested if Spike could block VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling. VEGF-A-triggered sensory neuronal firing was blocked by Spike protein and NRP-1 inhibitor EG00229. Pro-nociceptive behaviors of VEGF-A were similarly blocked via suppression of spontaneous spinal synaptic activity and reduction of electrogenic currents in sensory neurons. Remarkably, preventing VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling was antiallodynic in a neuropathic pain model. A  silencing of pain via subversion of VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling may underlie increased disease transmission in asymptomatic individuals.

427,COVID-19 Detection on Chest X-Ray and CT Scan Images Using Multi-image Augmented Deep Learning Model,"COVID-19 is posed as very infectious and deadly pneumonia type disease until recent time. Novel coronavirus or SARS-COV-2 strain is responsible for COVID-19 and it has already shown the deadly nature of respiratory disease by threatening the health of millions of lives across the globe. Clinical study reveals that a COVID-19 infected person may experience dry cough, muscle pain, headache, fever, sore throat and mild to moderate respiratory illness. At the same time, it affects the lungs badly with virus infection. So, the lung can be a prominent internal organ to diagnose the gravity of COVID-19 infection using X-Ray and CT scan images of chest. Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. This paper reports a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-image augmentation technique for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-Ray and chest CT scan images of coronavirus suspected individuals. Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%. Evaluation has been done on publicly available databases containing both chest X-Ray and CT scan images and the experimental results are also compared with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models.","Purohit, K.; Kesarwani, A.; Kisku, D.

428,Systematic modeling of SARS-CoV-2 protein structures,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, structural biologists are using experimental structural determination methods to better understand the viral proteome. Our goal in this work was to help researchers use these rapidly emerging structural data to gain detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying COVID-19 infection. Our analysis was based on the protein sequences defined by UniProt as comprising the viral proteome. We systematically compared each SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence against all available protein 3D structures derived from any organism (164,250 PDB entries), using pairs of hidden Markov models built with the HHblits tool. We found 872 sequence-to-structure alignments assessed to have significant similarity (E < 10e-10) to infer structural similarity. The resulting 872 3D template models now provide a wealth of new detail, currently not available from related resources. To help make this large, complex dataset accessible and usable for other researchers, we also developed a tailored layout strategy to visually organise the 3D models by mapping them to the viral genome. The resulting graph provides an immediate and comprehensive visual overview of what is known - and not known - about the 3D structure of the viral proteome, thereby helping direct future research. The graph also clearly reveals all available structural evidence of viral mimicry or hijacking of human proteins, as well as all evidence of interactions between viral proteins. We have created PDF and online versions of the graph, in which users can click on any node in the graph to open the corresponding 3D model in the Aquaria molecular graphics system. In Aquaria, these models can then be colored to show sequence features, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications. Previous versions of Aquaria showed only features from UniProt; however, as part of this study, we have now added features from PredictProtein and CATH, thus providing a total of 32,717 features for SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. In this work, we present novel insights found, using the above approach, into how SARS-CoV-2 mimics and hijacks host proteins, and how viral proteins self-assemble during infection.

429,Mutational dynamics and transmission properties of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in Austria,"Superspreading events shape the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we provide a national-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Austria, a country that played a major role for virus transmission across Europe and beyond. Capitalizing on a national epidemiological surveillance system, we performed deep whole-genome sequencing of virus isolates from 576 samples to cover major Austrian SARS-CoV-2 clusters. Our data chart a map of early viral spreading in Europe, including the path from low-frequency mutations to fixation. Detailed epidemiological surveys enabled us to calculate the effective SARS-CoV-2 population bottlenecks during transmission and unveil time-resolved intra-patient viral quasispecies dynamics. This study demonstrates the power of integrating deep viral genome sequencing and epidemiological data to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads through populations.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered pathological inflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We report here that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules are upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients, compared with healthy controls. Among the most highly increased inflammatory mediators in severe/critically ill patients, S100A9, an alarmin and TLR4 ligand, was found as a noteworthy biomarker, because it inversely correlated with the serum albumin levels. These data support a link between TLR4 signaling and pathological inflammation during COVID-19 and contribute to develop therapeutic approaches through targeting TLR4-mediated inflammation.","Sohn, K.

431,A single intranasal dose of chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine confers sterilizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and likely confers sterilizing immunity in most animals. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, and curtailing pandemic spread.","Hassan, A. O.; Kafai, N. M.; Dmitriev, I.

432,Longitudinal analysis of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD in convalescent plasma donors,"Hema-Quebec, the blood supplier in the Province of Quebec, Canada, collects and tests convalescent plasma used in a clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of this product for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So far, we have collected 1159 plasma units from 282 COVID-19 convalescent donors. The presence of antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent donors was established at the first donation. Seropositive donors were asked to donate additional plasma units every six days. Until now, 15 donors have donated at least four times and, in some cases, up to nine times. This allowed us to perform a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in these repeat donors, with the first donation occurring 33-77 days after symptoms onset and donations up to 71-114 days after symptoms onset thereafter. In all donors, the level of antibodies remained relatively stable up to about 76 days after symptoms onset but then started to decrease more rapidly to reach, in some convalescent donors, a seronegative status within 100-110 days after symptoms onset. The decline in anti-RBD antibodies was not related to the number of donations but strongly correlated with the numbers of days after symptoms onset (r = 0.821). This suggests that de novo secretion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies by short-lived plasma cells stopped about 2-3 months after disease onset, an observation that has important implications for convalescent plasma collection and seroprevalence studies undertaken several months after the peak of infection.","Perreault, J.; Tremblay, T.; Fournier, M.-J.; Drouin, M.; Beaudoin-Bussieres, G.; Prevost, J.; Lewin, A.; Begin, P.; Finzi, A.; Bazin, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.206847v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
433,Development of a simple in vitro assay to identify and evaluate nucleotide analogs against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,"Nucleotide analogs targeting viral RNA polymerase have been approved to be an effective strategy for antiviral treatment and are attracting antiviral drugs to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by RdRp. We found that the incorporation efficiency of Remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and we did not observe chain termination or delayed chain termination caused by single Remdesivir-TP incorporation, while multiple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low either as ATP or GTP analogs, which suggested that mutagenesis may not be the mechanism of action of those two drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Incorporation of Sofosbuvir-TP is also very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2-C-Methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

434,Modeling the Impact of Lock-down on COVID-19 Spread in Malaysia,"After a breakdown notified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 is declared as pandemic diseases. To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases. The implemented SEIR model shows a close resemblance with the actual data recorded from 10, March till 7, July 2020.

Here we demonstrate that the NRF2 anti-oxidant gene expression pathway is suppressed in biopsies obtained from COVID-19 patients. Further, we uncover that NRF2 agonists 4-octyl-itaconate (4-OI) and the clinically approved dimethyl fumarate (DMF) induce a cellular anti-viral program, which potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV2 across cell lines. The anti-viral program extended to inhibit the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent mechanism. In addition, induction of NRF2 by 4-OI and DMF limited host inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV2 infection associated with airway COVID-19 pathology. In conclusion, NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF induce a distinct IFN-independent antiviral program that is broadly effective in limiting virus replication and suppressing the pro-inflammatory responses of human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV2.

COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and has spread globally. Although Thailand has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, disease surveillance and information on antibody responses in infected cases and close contacts are needed because there is still no specific treatment or vaccine available. We investigated 217 recovered COVID-19 cases to monitor their viral RNA shedding and production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of COVID-19 cases was also determined. Viral RNA was still detectable in 6.6 % of recovered COVID-19 cases. The most prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding detected in this study was 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.82, 88.48, and 83.41 % of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Although the patients had recovered from their illness, the levels of antibodies detected showed association with their symptoms during their stay in hospital. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.87 %) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that there was viral exposure among close contacts. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combatting SARS-CoV-2.

437,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Protease Inhibitors by a Quantitative High-throughput Screening,"Background and PurposeThe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emphasized the urgent need for therapeutic development. Drug repurposing screening is the most practical and rapid approach for discovery of such therapeutics. The 3CLpro, or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a valid drug target as it is a viral enzyme with an essential role in viral replication, and cleavage specificity that is distinct from host proteases.

Experimental ApproachWe employed and miniaturized a fluorogenic 3CLpro enzyme assay in which 3CLpro cleaves a quenched peptide substrate and releases a fluorescent fragment, resulting an increase in fluorescence signal. By using this SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay, we conducted a qHTS of 10,755 compounds consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive compounds, at 4 compound concentrations. The confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors were also tested in a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay to determine their effects on rescuing of cell death caused by the virus infection.

Key ResultsTwenty-seven small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 27.1 M with a greater than 80% maximal inhibition. Walrycin B (IC50 = 0.26 M), Hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 M), Suramin sodium (IC50 = 6.50 M), Z-DEVD-FMK (IC50 = 6.81 M), and LLL-12 (IC50 = 9.84 M) are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors with IC50s under 10 M. The activities of anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were confirmed in 11 of 27 compounds.

Conclusion and ImplicationsSome of the newly identified inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro may be used in combination therapy with other drugs for synergistic effect to treat COVID-19 patients. The other inhibitors found in this study can provide starting points for medicinal chemistry optimizations.

Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs, and of the S protein, to investigate this  nicotinic hypothesis. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop of the S protein to three nAChRs, namely the human 4{beta}2 and 7 subtypes and the muscle-like {beta}{gamma}{delta} receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results indicate that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs and the region responsible for binding contains the PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. In particular, R682 has a key role in the stabilisation of the complexes as it forms interactions with loops A, B and C in the receptors binding pocket. The conformational behaviour of the bound Y674-R685 region is highly dependent on the receptor subtype, adopting extended conformations in the 4{beta}2 and 7 complexes and more compact ones when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the 4{beta}2 and {beta}{gamma}{delta} complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the 7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket where it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1 and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685, forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes, but has highest affinity for the muscle-type receptor. Analyses of the simulations of the full-length S protein show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding, and suggest a potential binding orientation of the S protein with nAChRs.","Oliveira, A.

439,Vinegar and Its Active Component Acetic Acid Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infection In Vitro and Ex Vivo,"Effective and economical measures are needed to either prevent or inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in the upper respiratory tract. As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 {degrees}C vs. 37 {degrees}C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.","Pagani, I.; Ghezzi, S.; Clementi, M.; Poli, G.; Bussi, M.; Pianta, L.; Trimarchi, M.; Vicenzi, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193193v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193193v1?rss=1,2020-07-17,2020-07-17,,False
440,Comprehensive analysis of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in different geographic regions of India: An endeavour to classify Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains on the basis of co-existing mutations,"Accumulation of mutations within the genome is the primary driving force for viral evolution within an endemic setting. This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility as well as antigenic shift to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we aimed at genome-wide analyses of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses for the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their spatial distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 441 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 21 being distinctive to India. Emergence of novel mutations were observed in S glycoprotein (7/33), NSP3 (6/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33) and N (2/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.4 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on the co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that representative strain of each group divided themselves into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. India was dominated by A2a clade (55.60%) followed by A3 (37.38%) and B (7%), but exhibited heterogeneous distribution among various geographical regions. The A2a clade mostly predominated in East India, Western India and Central India, whereas A3 clade prevailed in South and North India. In conclusion, this study highlights the divergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains and co-circulation of multiple clades in India. Monitoring of the emerging mutations would pave ways for vaccine formulation and designing of antiviral drugs.","Sarkar, R.; Mitra, S.; Chandra, P.; Saha, P.; Banerjee, A.; Dutta, S.; Chawla-Sarkar, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
441,Antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in response to immune pressure,"The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially driven by the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the virus.","Forni, D.; Cagliani, R.; Pontremoli, C.; Mozzi, A.; Pozzoli, U.; Clerici, M.; Sironi, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
442,Alignment-free machine learning approaches for the lethality prediction of potential novel human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide,"A newly emerging novel coronavirus appeared and rapidly spread worldwide and World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The roles and characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe on humans. The detection of the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide perspective for treatment. We developed alignment-free machine learning approaches for an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide. We performed extensive experiments through six different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms in combination with digital signal processing to infer the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses using previous existing strains. The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human coronaviruses. Our study achieves high levels of prediction performance based on raw RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge. The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this alignment-free machine learning-based approach can offer a reliable real-time estimation for its viral lethality.","YIN, R.; Luo, Z.; Kwoh, C.

443,Comparative multiplexed interactomics of SARS-CoV-2 and homologous coronavirus non-structural proteins identifies unique and shared host-cell dependencies,"Human coronaviruses (hCoV) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 - an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed anti-viral therapeutics.","Davies, J. P.; Almasy, K. M.; McDonald, E.

We report herein a therapeutic based on catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species, which are excessively produced resulting from the infection and inflammatory process. Catalase assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity. Such a therapeutic can be readily manufactured at low cost as a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Qin, M.; Cao, Z.; Wen, J.; Yu, Q.; Liu, C.; Wang, F.; Yang, F.; Li, Y.; Fishbein, G.

445,Bioinformatic analysis of shared B and T cell epitopes amongst relevant coronaviruses to human health: Is there cross-protection?,"Within the last 30 years 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have evolved and adapted to cause disease and spread amongst the human population. From the three, SARS-CoV-2 has spread world-wide and to July 2020 it has been responsible for more than 11 million confirmed cases and over half a million deaths. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, social distancing has been the most effective measure to control the pandemic. However it has become evident that as the virus spreads the only tool that will allow us to fully control it is an effective vaccine. There are currently more than 150 vaccine candidates in different stages of development using a variety of viral antigens, with the S protein being the most targeted antigen. Although some new experimental evidence suggests cross-reacting responses between coronaviruses are present in the population, it remains unknown whether potential shared antigens between different coronaviruses could provide cross-protection. Given that coronaviruses are emerging pathogens and continue to represent a threat to global health, the development of a SARS-Cov-2 vaccine that could provide  universal protection against other coronaviruses should be pushed forward. Here we present a thorough review of reported B and T cell epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and other relevant coronaviruses, in addition we used web-based tools to predict novel B and T cell epitopes that have not been reported before. Analysis of experimental evidence that is constantly emerging complemented with the findings of this study allow us support the hypothesis that cross-reactive responses, particularly those coming from T cells, might play a key role in controlling infection by SARS-CoV-2. We hope that with the evidence presented in this manuscript we provide arguments to encourage the study of cross-reactive responses in order to elucidate their role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Finally we expect our findings will aid targeted analysis of antigen-specific immune responses and guide future vaccine design aiming to develop a cross reactive effective vaccine against respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.","Pacheco-Olvera, D.

446,Bivalent binding of a fully human IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins reveals mechanisms of potent neutralization,"In vitro antibody selection against pathogens from naive combinatorial libraries can yield various classes of antigen-specific binders that are distinct from those evolved from natural infection1-4. Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction5. Here we report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naive human Fab library. Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the ""up"" and the other in the ""down"" position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, B.; Asarnow, D.; Lee, W.-H.; Huang, C.-W.; Faust, B.; Ng, P. M. L.; Ngoh, E. Z.

447,A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells,"SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","Schmidt, N.; Lareau, C.

448,Evaluation of NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome characterisation,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been performed at unprecedented rate worldwide with the use of very diverse Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2/8 and 1/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct [&ge;]25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","Charre, C.; Ginevra, C.; Sabatier, M.; Regue, H.; Brun, S.; Burfin, G.; Scholtes, C.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Bal, A.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
449,The Effect Of Famotidine On SARS-CoV-2 Proteases And Virus Replication,"The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Loffredo, M.; Lucero, H.; Chen, D.-Y.; O'Connell, A.; Bergqvist, S.; Munawar, A.; Bandara, A.; DeGraef, S.; Weeks, S.

450,Prophylactic and Therapeutic Inhibition of In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Oleandrin,"With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","Plante, K. S.; Plante, J.

451,"The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier: Kinetics, distribution, mechanisms, and influence of ApoE genotype, sex, and inflammation","Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 {+/-} 0.024 L/g-min and 0.294 {+/-} 0.032 L/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood. ApoE isoform or sex did not affect whole brain uptake, but had variable effects on olfactory bulb, liver, spleen, and kidney uptakes. In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.

452,Evidence of SARS-CoV2 entry protein ACE2 in the human nose and olfactory bulb,"Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptom. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human, post-mortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium.

Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb.

453,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Depends on Cellular Heparan Sulfate and ACE2,"We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its Receptor Binding Domain. Docking studies suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.","Clausen, T. M.; Sandoval, D. R.; Spliid, C.

454,SARS-CoV-2 uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis to gain access into cells,"With more than 13 million cases and 570,000 deaths, and with the resulting social upheaval, the COVID-19 pandemic presents one of the greatest challenges ever to the scientific community. It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface and to drive fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes, thus allowing transfer of viral RNA to the cytosol. Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.","Bayati, A.; Kumar, R.; Francis, V.; McPherson, P.

455,Syncytia formation by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells,"Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with extensive lung damage and the presence of infected multinucleated syncytial pneumocytes. The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.

456,The antibody response to the glycan α-Gal correlates with COVID-19 disease symptoms,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Urra, J.

Multi-strain sequence alignments of coronaviruses (CoV) provide important information for interpreting the genome and its variation. We apply a comparative genomics method, ConsHMM, to the multi-strain alignments of CoV to annotate every base of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with conservation states based on sequence alignment patterns among CoV. The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and the state annotations are more predictive than existing genomic annotations in prioritizing bases without non-singleton mutations, which are likely enriched for important genomic bases.

458,Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycan-assisted endocytosis as a COVID-19 therapeutic option,"Drugs capable of blocking the infectious cycle of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to tackle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the viral Spike (S) protein to human ACE2, has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target. Here we use murine leukemia viruses pseudotyped with Spike from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated coronavirus entry can be mitigated by heparin, a heparan sulfate-related glycan, or by genetic ablation of biosynthetic enzymes for the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A drug repurposing screen targeting HSPG-dependent endocytosis identifies pharmacologically active endocytosis inhibitors that also abrogate coronavirus cell entry. Among them, Mitoxantrone (EC50=~10 nM) targets HSPGs directly, whereas Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to impair HSPG-assisted viral entry. Gene expression profiling suggests potential combination regimens that optimally target HSPG-dependent viral entry. Altogether, our study establishes HSPGs as an assisting factor for ACE2 in endocytosis-mediated coronavirus entry and identifies drugs that can be repurposed to target this important stage in the viral life cycle.","Zhang, Q.; Chen, C.; Swaroop, M.; Xu, M.; Wang, L.; Lee, J.; Pradhan, M.; Shen, M.; Luo, Z.; Xu, Y.; Huang, W.; Zheng, W.; Ye, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,False

While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential should get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation probability patterns are evolving in 864 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 30 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of four months. Out of these, the mutational probabilities of 25 variants including C14408T (in RdRp gene), A23403G (in spike gene), C6312A (nsp3 gene) are continuously increasing suggesting that these mutations are being propagated with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. In contrast, the mutational probabilities of five variants including C6312A (nsp3 gene), G11083T (nsp6 gene), C28311T (N gene) have significantly decreased in May-June as compared to March-April, suggesting these mutations are being terminated with time.

460,"Tobacco, but not nicotine and flavor-less electronic cigarettes, induces ACE2 and immune dysregulation","COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions worldwide. This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig/smoking.","Lee, A. C.; Chakladar, J.; Li, W.

Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail. Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk.

462,PT150 is a modulator of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.,"PT150 is a clinical stage molecule, taken orally, with a strong safety profile having completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for its original use as an anti-depressant. It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 M. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Theise, N.

464,Identifying Key Determinants of SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 Tight Interaction,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","Ngo, V.

465,Single-cell analysis reveals the function of lung progenitor cells in COVID-19 patients,"The high mortality of severe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barriers, pulmonary edema and consequently inflammatory tissue damage. Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1. Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration.

466,Comparisons of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and those of other betacoronaviruses,"The genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is most closely related to viral metagenomes isolated from bats and, more distantly, pangolins. All are of sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. We have unravelled their recombinational and mutational histories. All showed clear evidence of recombination, most events involving the 3 half of the genomes. The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.","Rodriguez-Roman, E.; Gibbs, A.

This marks a unique opportunity to study how a virus spreads and evolves in a worldwide context. However, currently there is not a useful haplotype classification system to help tracking the virus evolution.

After that, we analyzed the geographical and temporal distribution of these OTUs, as well as their correlation with patient status. Our geographical analysis showed different OTUs prevalence between continents and the temporal distribution analysis revealed an evolution-like pattern in SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we observed a homogenous distribution of OTUs in mild and severe patients and a great prevalence of OTU 2 in asymptomatic patients. However, genomes in the asymptomatic category, comes from isolates on three consecutive days in February (15 to 17), weakening this observation and highlighting the need to increase genomic analyzes in asymptomatic and severe patients.

We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics. For example, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the open configuration, our method identifies a possible further opening and closing of the S1 subunit through movement of SB domain. With full structural information of this process available, docking studies with possible drug structures are then possible in silico. In our study, we present full results for the more than 200 thus far published SARS-CoV-2-related protein structures in the PDB.",Rudolf A Roemer; Navodya Sophie Roemer; Anne Katrine Wallis,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199364v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199364v1?rss=1,2020-07-12,2020-07-12,,False
471,Identifying SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors through drug repurposing screens of SARS- S and MERS-S pseudotyped particles,"While vaccine development will hopefully quell the global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, small molecule drugs that can effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Here inhibitors of two coronavirus spike proteins (S) were identified by screening a library of approved drugs with SARS-S and MERS-S pseudotyped particle entry assays. Using high-throughput screening technology, we discovered three compounds (cepharanthine, abemaciclib and trimipramine) to be broad spectrum inhibitors for spike-mediated entry.

472,A simple protein-based SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assay,"With the COVID-19 pandemic surpassing 12M confirmed cases and 550K deaths worldwide, defining the key components of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical. Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present and validate a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). This test is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD and serves as a surrogate neutralization assay.",Kento T Abe; Zhijie Li; Reuben Samson; Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani; Emelissa J Valcourt; Heidi Wood; Patrick Budylowski; Alan Dupuis; Roxie C Girardin; Bhavisha Rathod; Karen Colwill; Allison McGeer; Samira Mubareka; Jennifer L.

473,A Highly Immunogenic Measles Virus-based Th1-biased COVID-19 Vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread world-wide with millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths to date. The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.",Cindy Hoerner; Christoph Schuermann; Arne Auste; Aileen Ebenig; Samada Muraleedharan; Maike Herrmann; Barbara Schnierle; Michael D Muehlebach,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,False
474,ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in aging mouse brain,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Through a systematic analysis of publicly available mouse brain sc/snRNA-seq data, we found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in small sub-populations of endothelial cells and mural cells, namely pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, functional changes in viral mRNA transcription and replication, and impaired blood-brain barrier regulation were most prominently implicated in the aged, ACE2-expressing endothelial cells, when compared to the young adult mouse brains. Concordant EC transcriptomic changes were further found in normal aged human brains. Overall, this work reveals an outline of ACE2 distribution in the mouse brain and identify putative brain host cells that may underlie the selective susceptibility of the aging brain to viral infection.",SU Bin Lim; Valina L.

475,Which animals are at risk? Predicting species susceptibility to Covid-19,"In only a few months, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leaving physicians, scientists, and public health officials racing to understand, treat, and contain this zoonotic disease. SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings have important implications for identification of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for environmental and public health.",Matthew R Alexander; Clara T.

476,Replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector protects against SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of human infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Accordingly, an effective vaccine is of critical importance in mitigating coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) and curtailing the pandemic. We developed a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine by introducing a modified form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene in place of the native glycoprotein gene (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2). Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung indicating protection against pneumonia. Finally, passive transfer of sera from VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-immunized animals protects naive mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These data support development of VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 as an attenuated, replication-competent vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",James Brett Case; Paul Rothlauf; Rita E. Chen; Natasha Kafai; Julie M.

477,SARS-CoV-2 induces activation and diversification of human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells.,"Several studies have analyzed antiviral immune pathways in severe COVID-19 patients. However, the initial steps of antiviral immunity are not known. Here, we have studied the interaction of isolated primary SARS-CoV-2 viral strains with human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC), a key player in antiviral immunity. We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-{lambda}1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon- and inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that pDC may represent a major player in the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and call for caution in the use of hydroxychloroquine in the early treatment of the disease.",Fanny Onodi; Lucie Bonnet-Madin; Léa Karpf; Laurent Meertens; Justine Poirot; Jerôme LeGoff; Constance Delaugerre; Ali AMARA; Vassili Soumelis,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197343v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197343v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False

Characterising the pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hACs limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry.

479,Genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat: Underlying role of variants in disease epidemiology,"Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.

Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly associated with mortality in patients.

Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was  exhausted or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the non-exhausted subsets from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-{kappa}B signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects displayed polyfunctional features.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 {micro}g/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity.

To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment.

483,Discovery of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection using a phenotypic screening strategy and network-analysis to predict their potential to treat covid-19,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

484,A drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis C antivirals as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be [~]2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of [~]6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found [~]50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 [&le;] 50 M. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M), Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.",Jeremy D Baker; Rikki L Uhrich; Gerald C Kraemer; Jason E Love; Brian C Kraemer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False

It has raised questions in the press and elsewhere about the scientific basis of salmon as a source of infection. With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed.

486,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of human ACE2 transgenic mice causes severe inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and compromised respiratory function","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has spread worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.",Emma S Winkler; Adam L Bailey; Natasha M Kafai; Sharmila Nair; Broc T McCune; Jinsheng Yu; Julie M Fox; Rita E Chen; James T Earnest; Shamus P Keeler; Jon H Ritter; Liang-I Kang; Sarah Dort; Annette Robichaud; Richard Head; Michael J Holtzman; Michael S Diamond,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
487,Discriminating Mild from Critical COVID-19 by Innate and Adaptive Immune Single-cell Profiling of Bronchoalveolar Lavages,"How innate and adaptive lung immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 synchronize during COVID-19 pneumonitis and regulate disease severity is poorly established. To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically  controlled fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by  orderly phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity.

488,Genomic Mutations and Changes in Protein Secondary Structure and Solvent Accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Virus),"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.",Thanh Thi Nguyen; Pubudu N.

489,Comprehensive in-vivo secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals novel regulatory motifs and mechanisms,"SARS-CoV-2 is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes COVID-19, a disease that has triggered a major human health and economic crisis. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, complete secondary structure of SAR-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on mechanisms of replication, translation and packaging, and guide the identification of new RNA drug targets against COVID-19.",Nicholas C Huston; Han Wan; Rafael de Cesaris Araujo Tavares; Craig B Wilen; Anna Marie Pyle,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197079v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197079v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
490,Stabilizing the Closed SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer,"The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and development efforts. Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation.

491,Structures of potent and convergent neutralizing antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike unveil a unique epitope responsible for exceptional potency,"Understanding the mechanism of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for effective vaccines and therapeutics development. We recently reported an exceptionally potent NAb, BD-368-2, and revealed the existence of VH3-53/VH3-66 convergent NAbs in COVID-19. Here we report the 3.5-[A] cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer. Unlike VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 binding by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their ""up"" and ""down"" positions. BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape.

To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitch platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types. With the peptide exchange generated MHC tetramers, scientists can assess CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes.

493,Human B cell clonal expansion and convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,"During virus infection B cells are critical for the production of antibodies and protective immunity. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped naive responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19 patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the presence of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-binding domain.

494,Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases,"BackgroundLittle is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases.

Methods and findingsWe explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative.

In mice, the vaccine candidate, tentatively named YF-S0, induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and a favorable Th1 cell-mediated immune response. In a stringent hamster SARS-CoV-2 challenge model2, vaccine candidate YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2.

496,Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and fatal respiratory disease,"ABSTRACTThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created an international health crisis. Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Joseph W.

497,Dual nature of human ACE2 glycosylation in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike,"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.",Ahmad Reza Mehdipour; Gerhard Hummer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,False
498,Screening and testing for a suitable untransfected cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies,"At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.

Author summaryIn the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.",Claudia Pommerenke; Ulfert Rand; Cord C.

While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of [&ge;]1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant.

Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 9-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The in situ architecture of the ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. These characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to an unprecedented resolution, and shed lights on how the virus packs its ~30 Kb long single-segmented RNA in the ~80 nm diameter lumen.

501,"Comprehensive variant and haplotype landscapes of 50,500 global SARS-CoV-2 isolates and accelerating accumulation of country-private variant profiles","Understanding the genetic etiology of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive understanding of the variant and haplotype landscape of all reported genomes of SARS-COV-2, the causative virus of the disease. Country-, state/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently.

Evidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May.

In summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.",Lishuang Shen; Jennifer Dien Bard; Jaclyn A.

502,Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations,"AimThe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.

MethodsAn extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with {+/-}1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/).

ResultsA total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.",Leire Moya; Samaneh Farashi; Prashanth N Suravajhala; Panchadsaram Janaththani; Jyotsna Batra,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.179028v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.179028v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
503,Enhanced COVID-19 data for improved prediction of survival,"The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the rapid world-wide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is having severe consequences for human health and the world economy. The virus effects individuals quite differently, with many infected patients showing only mild symptoms, and others showing critical illness. To lessen the impact of the pandemic, one important question is which factors predict the death of a patient? Here, we construct an enhanced COVID-19 dataset by processing two existing databases (from Kaggle and WHO) and using natural language processing methods to enhance the data by adding local weather conditions and research sentiment.Author summary In this study, we contribute an enhanced COVID-19 dataset, which contains 183 samples and 43 features. Application of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on the enhanced dataset achieves 95% accuracy in predicting patients survival, with country-wise research sentiment, and then age and local weather, showing the most importance.

504,Towards the design of multiepitope-based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis. This multiepitope-based peptide vaccine may represent a potential candidate against coronavirus 2. However, further in vitro and in vivo verification are required.",Hasanain Abdulhameed Odhar; Salam Waheed Ahjel; Suhad Sami Humadi,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.186122v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.186122v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
505,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces germinal center responses with robust stimulation of CD4 T follicular helper cells in rhesus macaques,"CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important for the generation of long-lasting and specific humoral protection against viral infections. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.",Sonny R. Elizaldi; Yashavanth Shaan Lakshmanappa; Jamin W. Roh; Brian A.

Here, we produced extracellular vesicles (EVs) exposing ACE2 and demonstrate that ACE2-EVs are efficient decoys for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-containing lentivirus. Reduction of infectivity positively correlates with the level of ACE2, is 500 to 1500 times more efficient than with soluble ACE2 and further enhanced by the inclusion of TMPRSS2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Federico Cocozza; Ester Piovesana; Nathalie Névo; Xavier Lahaye; Julian Buchrieser; Olivier Schwartz; Nicolas Manel; Mercedes Tkach; Clotilde Théry; Lorena Martin-Jaular,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193672v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.193672v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
507,Continuous flexibility analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike prefusion structures,"With the help of novel processing workflows and algorithms, we have obtained a better understanding of the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion state. We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Roberto Melero; Carlos Oscar S.

508,Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated-transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function.

509,In vivo structural characterization of the whole SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome identifies host cell target proteins vulnerable to re-purposed drugs,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Lei Sun; Pan Li; Xiaohui Ju; Jian Rao; Wenze Huang; Shaojun Zhang; Tuanlin Xiong; Kui Xu; Xiaolin Zhou; Lili Ren; Qiang Ding; Jianwei Wang; Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False
510,Favipiravir and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hamster model,"Despite no or limited pre-clinical evidence, repurposed drugs are massively evaluated in clinical trials to palliate the lack of antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Here we used a Syrian hamster model to assess the antiviral efficacy of favipiravir, understand its mechanism of action and determine its pharmacokinetics. When treatment was initiated before or simultaneously to infection, favipiravir had a strong dose effect, leading to dramatic reduction of infectious titers in lungs and clinical alleviation of the disease. Antiviral effect of favipiravir correlated with incorporation of a large number of mutations into viral genomes and decrease of viral infectivity. The antiviral efficacy observed in this study was achieved with plasma drug exposure comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials and was associated with weight losses in animals. Thereby, pharmacokinetic and tolerance studies are required to determine whether similar effects can be safely achieved in humans.","Driouich, J.-S.; Cochin, M.; Lingas, G.; Moureau, G.; Touret, F.; Petit, P.-R.; Piorkowski, G.; Barthelemy, K.; Coutard, B.; Guedj, J.; de Lamballerie, X.; Solas, C.; Nougairede, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191775v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
511,The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","Tavares, R. d.

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5’ untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Schubert, K.; Karousis, E.

513,Unique transcriptional changes in coagulation cascade genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells: A potential factor in COVID-19 coagulopathies,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

515,A Fluorescence-based High Throughput-Screening assay for the SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

516,Spike protein fusion loop controls SARS-CoV-2 fusogenicity and infectivity,"The Spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We have investigated the Spike from six β-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β-coronavirus MHV-A59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo. The Spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.Summary The Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is the prime mediator of COVID-191 because of its central role in virus-host attachment, virus-entry, and virus-spread2. The contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the Spike glycoprotein3, its high affinity of binding to human ACE2 receptor4, and cleavage5. While these may be imperative, it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity. Here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of SARS-CoV-2 Spike that triggers the virus fusion, distinguishes it from the other five β-coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic, including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides. The fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive β-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β-coronavirus, MHV-A59 studies6. The synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process, which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Pal, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
517,"Genes Encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Related Proteins Mediating SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry are Upregulated with Age in Human Cardiomyocytes","Age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in patients following COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Robinson, E.

518,A rapidly adaptable biomaterial vaccine for SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Langellotto, F.; Seiler, B.

519,Alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks by integer linear programming: SARS-CoV-2,"Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","Llabres, M.; Valiente, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
520,Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2,"Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, Y.

521,The evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within the coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus,"SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2 receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","Wells, H.

522,Animal Model Prescreening: Pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 impacts responses in the NHP model,"COVID-19 presents herculean challenges to research and scientific communities for producing diagnostic and treatment solutions. Any return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures, with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics. Animal disease status and potential COVID-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing. We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate pre-challenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal pre-screening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.

523,Discovery of Drug-like Ligands for the Mac1 Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3,"ABSTRACTThe Mac1 domain of the multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) is a potential COVID-19 drug target because it is suspected to enhance the ability of the virus to evade the human immune system. The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain binds ADP-ribose and proteins harboring this important post-translational modification. Small molecules that bind the Mac1 domain in place of ADP-ribose might therefore be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for antiviral drug discovery. Two high throughput screens were used here to identify such ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. The first screen used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, aka the thermal shift or ThermoFluor assay) to examine the melting temperature of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain in the presence of various compounds. In the second screen, various high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structures were used with Autodock VINA to identify potential ligands. Numerous hit compounds were either steroids (estradiol valerate &amp; flunisolide), beta-lactams (cefaclor &amp; cefatrizine), or benzimidazoles (telmisartan, rabeprazole, omeprazole, &amp; esomeprazole). Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to confirm that rabeprazole, omeprazole, and compounds in other chemical classes, such as irinotecan, nifedipine, trifluoperazine, bind SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with an affinity similar to ADP-ribose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Virdi, R.

524,N and O glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motives on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike proteins glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.","Sanda, M.; Morrison, L.; Goldman, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
525,Identification of potent and safe antiviral therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion.

526,Comparison of Transgenic and Adenovirus hACE2 Mouse Models for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Rathnasinghe, R.; Strohmeier, S.; Amanat, F.; Gillespie, V.

Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3’-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3’-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, A.

In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Graudenzi, A.; Maspero, D.; Angaroni, F.; Piazza, R.; Ramazzotti, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
529,SARS-CoV-2 contributes to altering the post-transcriptional regulatory networks across human tissues by sponging RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key pos-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Srivastava, R.; Daulatabad, S.

530,Renal carcinoma is associated with increased risk of coronavirus infections,"The current pandemic COVID-19 has affected most severely to the people with old age, or with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and cancers. Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors’ expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tripathi, S.

531,Gene Expression Network Analysis Provides Potential Targets Against SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTBACKGROUND Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xiao, Y.; Li, Z.; Wang, X.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Wang, G.; Ren, L.; Li, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189860v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189860v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
533,Snapshot of the evolution and mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history. Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhao, J.; zhai, x.; Zhou, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1,2020-07-05,2020-07-05,,False
534,The potential role of miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay,ABSTRACTHost miRNAs are known as important regulators of virus replication and pathogenesis. They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV. Further bioinformatic analysis of binding sites revealed high conservativity of miR-21-3p binding regions within RNAs of human coronaviruses and their strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text,"Nersisyan, S.; Engibaryan, N.; Gorbonos, A.; Kirdey, K.; Makhonin, A.; Tonevitsky, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.184846v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.184846v1?rss=1,2020-07-04,2020-07-04,,False

Female authors are facing a decrease in papers submission rates since the beginning of the pandemic period. The reasons for this decline in women productivity need to be further investigated. Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science. This particular situation we are facing during the pandemic demands institutional flexibility and academia should foster the discussion about actions to benefit Black scientists and academics with families in the post-pandemic scenario.","Staniscuaski, F.; Kmetzsch, L.; Zandona, E.; Reichert, F.; Soletti, R.

536,A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global pathogen1,2, sparking urgent vaccine development efforts with the trimeric spike3,4. However, the inability of antibodies like CR30225, which binds a cryptic spike epitope with nanomolar affinity6, to neutralize virus, suggests a spike-based means of neutralization escape. Here, we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have 10% the unfolding enthalpy of a globular protein at physiological pH, where it is recognized by antibodies like CR3022, and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where it sheds such antibodies, suggesting that the spike evades potentially neutralizing antibody through a pH-dependent mechanism of conformational masking. To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH. In the absence of ACE2, cryo-EM analyses indicated lower pH to reduce conformational heterogeneity. Single-receptor binding domain (RBD)-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH through lowering of RBD and refolding of a pH-dependent switch. Notably, the emerging Asp614Gly strain7 partially destabilizes the switch that locks RBD down, thereby enhancing functional interactions with ACE2 while reducing evasion by conformational masking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhou, T.; Tsybovsky, Y.; Olia, A.

537,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant D614G increases infectivity and retains sensitivity to antibodies that target the receptor binding domain,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus worldwide in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of various mammalian ACE2 orthologs. Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.","Yurkovetskiy, L.; Pascal, K.

538,Robust and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 using PCR based methods,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an international health emergency. Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.","Park, C.; Lee, J.; Hassan, Z. U.; Ku, K. B.; Kim, S. J.; Kim, H.

The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sikora, M.; von Bülow, S.; Blanc, F.

In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

An investigation of the viral distribution within the human body in correlation to tissue damage can help understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.We present a detailed mapping of viral RNA in 61 tissues and organs of 11 deceased patients with the diagnosis COVID-19. The autopsies were performed within the (very) early postmortem interval (mean: 5.6 hours) to avoid bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Viral loads, blood levels of cytokines, prothrombotic factors as well as macro- and micro-morphology were correlated.Very high (&gt; 104 copies/ml) viral loads were detected in the lungs of most patients and then correlated to severe tissue damage. Intact viral particles could be verified in the lung tissue by transmission electron microscopy. Viral loads in the lymph nodes were associated with a loss of follicular architecture. Viral RNA was detected throughout further extra-pulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage. Inflammatory cytokines as well as the prothrombotic factors were elevated in all patients.In conclusion, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2-RNA throughout the body supports the hypothesis of a maladaptive host response with viremia and multi-organ dysfunction.View Full Text","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Wittschieber, D.; Sanft, J.; Kleemann, S.; Elschner, S.; Haupt, K.

545,Using iCn3D and the World Wide Web for structure-based collaborative research: Analyzing molecular interactions at the root of COVID-19,"ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials.

547,Association between neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and commercial serological assays,"Introduction Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tang, M.

550,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for large amounts of diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA, which commercial suppliers are increasingly unable to deliver. In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","Kalnina, L.; Mateu-Regue, A.; Oerum, S.; Hald, A.; Gerstoft, J.; Oerum, H.; Cilius Nielsen, F.; Iversen, A.

551,periscope: sub-genomic RNA identification in SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC Network Nanopore Sequencing Data,"We have developed periscope, a tool for the detection and quantification of sub-genomic RNA in ARTIC network protocol generated Nanopore SARS-CoV-2 sequence data. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Sheffield, UK. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sub-genomic RNA. We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis. Finally variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sub-genomic RNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to tens of thousands of sequences worldwide to provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sub-genomic RNA to date.","Parker, M. D.; Lindsey, B.

552,Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundRT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

ConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","Chaix, M.-L.; Wirden, M.; Feghoul, L.; Bertine, M.; Nere, M.-L.; Le Hingrat, Q.; Abdi, B.; Boutolleau, D.; Ferre, V.

553,Discovery of Synergistic and Antagonistic Drug Combinations against SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro,"COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Bobrowski, T.; Chen, L.; Eastman, R.

554,Assessment of Proton-Coupled Conformational Dynamics of SARS and MERS Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases: Implication for Designing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Inhibitors,"Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future ones. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Henderson, J.

555,High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lu, J.; Sun, P.

556,Attenuated Subcomponent Vaccine Design Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein RNA Binding Domain: In silico analysis,"ABSTRACTThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has previously never been identified with humans, thereby creating devastation in public health. The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chukwudozie, O.

557,SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals are likely expanded by beta-coronaviruses,"The current pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and large progress in understanding the pathology of the virus has been made since its emergence in late 2019. Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Stervbo, U.; Rahmann, S.; Roch, T.; Westhoff, T.

558,Early data on the performance of a combined SARS-CoV-2 spike-nucleocapsid antibody lateral flow device compared to a nucleocapsid-only device,"Background There is a critical need for reliable antibody detection methods in order to study and evaluate the public health and clinical response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices offer the prospect of rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), but the performance of these devices must be evaluated for robustness before they can be adopted for routine clinical and public health use.Methods Plasma and serum specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n = 131) and RNA-negative (n = 16) patients were taken from various time points with respect to the onset of symptoms. All 147 anonymised specimens were tested for IgM and IgG using the Hangzhou AllTest 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and the Abbexa COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit.Results IgM sensitivity ranged from 13% to 68%, depending on the date of symptom onset and the device. Regarding IgG, the Abbexa device outperformed the Hangzhou device at all cumulative timeline brackets, with sensitivity of 97·87% (Abbexa) versus 68·09% (Hangzhou) for samples beyond 21 days from symptom onset. Day 21 was therefore chosen as the cut-off for ascertaining test performance characteristics, beyond which the specificity was 100% for both devices and negative predictive value was 0·94 (Abbexa) versus 0·50 (Hangzhou).Discussion Based on this limited dataset, the performance characteristics of the Abbexa LFIA device were substantially better than those of the Hangzhou device. Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device meets the minimum (98%) sensitivity and specificity thresholds set by the UK Medicine &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou that targets only the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Linares, C.

559,Next-generation diagnostics: virus capture facilitates a sensitive viral diagnosis for epizootic and zoonotic pathogens including SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.

MethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.

ResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.

ConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","Wylezich, C.; Calvelage, S.; Schlottau, K.; Ziegler, U.; Pohlmann, A.; Hoeper, D.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False
560,Genetic architecture of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2,"Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid  in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

And elevated ACE2 level was also detected in mouse models of dermatitis induced by imiquimod, calcipotriol, repeated tape-stripping or 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) respectively. Moreover, alleviation of cutaneous inflammation with skin recovery moisture also lowered expression of ACE2 in mouse models with barrier deteriorated inflammatory skin disorders. Furthermore, inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increased the penetration of topical FITC conjugated spike protein into the skin.

The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.

At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.

Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries.

We find that at low frequencies, the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations. Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values and exhibits no other peaks apart from one associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent that characterizes the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.","Tan, H.

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 engages host ACE2 for adhesion, TMPRSS2 for activation and entry. With the aid of whole-exome sequencing, we report a variant rs12329760 in TMPRSS2 gene and its mutant V160M, which might impede viral entry. Furthermore, we identified TMPRSS2 cleavage sites in S2 domain of spike glycoprotein and report the structure of TMPRSS2 in complex with spike glycoprotein. We also report the structures of protease inhibitors in complex with TMPRSS2, which could hamper the interaction with spike protein.

566,A glycan cluster on the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain is recognized by Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive antibodies,"SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has escalated into a global crisis. The spike (S) protein that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion is the current focus of vaccine and therapeutic antibody development efforts. The S protein, like many other viral fusion proteins such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is glycosylated with both complex and high mannose glycans. Here we demonstrate binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by a category of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive (FDG) HIV-1-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). A 3.1 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the S protein ectodomain bound to glycan-dependent HIV-1 bnAb 2G12 revealed a quaternary glycan epitope on the spike S2 domain involving multiple protomers.

567,Mutations from bat ACE2 orthologs markedly enhance ACE2-Fc neutralization of SARS-CoV-2,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","Mou, H.; Quinlan, B.; Peng, H.; Guo, Y.; Peng, S.; Zhang, L.; Davis-Gardner, M.; Gardner, M.; Voo, Z.

568,"Unsupervised cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicates that recent (June 2020) cases in Beijing are from a genetic subgroup that consists of mostly European and South(east) Asian samples, of which the latter are the most recent","Research efforts of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have focused on viral genome sequence analysis to understand how the virus spread across the globe. Here, we assess three recently identified SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Beijing from June 2020 and attempt to determine the origin of these genomes, made available in the GISAID database. The database contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Including the three new samples and excluding samples with missing annotations, we analyzed 7, 643 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using principal component analysis computed on a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index, we find that the newly discovered virus genomes from Beijing are in a genetic cluster that consists mostly of cases from Europe and South(east) Asia. The sequences of the new cases are most related to virus genomes from a small number of cases from China (March 2020), cases from Europe (February to early May 2020), and cases from South(east) Asia (May to June 2020). These findings could suggest that the original cases of this genetic cluster originated from China in March 2020 and were re-introduced to China by transmissions from samples from South(east) Asia between April and June 2020.","Hahn, G.; Cho, M.

Here, we show that S1-Fc antigen delivery targeting the Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cell compartment elicits anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-antigen specific IgG production in vivo exerting biologically functional and protective activity against live virus infection, assessed in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay in vitro. The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo. Interestingly, immunization at elevated doses with non-expiring S1-Fc encoding dsDNA favors the education of a desired antigen-specific adaptive T cell response. However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","Malimova, M.; Sidhom, E.-H.; Satyam, A.; Dvela-Levitt, M.; Melanson, M.; Chamberlain, B.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml.

576,Structure of the full SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected cells,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models.

577,Anti-frameshifting ligand active against SARS coronavirus-2 is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins. Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress −1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of −1 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Neupane, K.; Munshi, S.; Zhao, M.; Ritchie, D.

578,SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Human Lung Alveolar Type 2 Cells Elicits a Rapid Epithelial-Intrinsic Inflammatory Response,"ABSTRACTThe most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Huang, J.; Hume, A.

579,Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-EM,"The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xu, C.; Wang, Y.; Liu, C.; Zhang, C.; Han, W.; Hong, X.; Wang, Y.; Hong, Q.; Wang, S.; Zhao, Q.; Wang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Chen, K.; Zheng, W.; Kong, L.; Wang, F.; Zuo, Q.; Huang, Z.; Cong, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False
580,Development of RNA-based assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples,"The ongoing spread of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the lack of specific drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, demands rapid diagnosis and management are crucial for controlling the outbreak in the community. Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 (n=18). The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects (n=18) or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women (n=2). The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening.

Severe symptoms include viral pneumonia secondary to infection and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract, in some cases causing death. We developed primary human lung epithelial infection models to understand responses of proximal and distal lung epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differentiated air-liquid interface cultures of proximal airway epithelium and 3D organoid cultures of alveolar epithelium were readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 leading to an epithelial cell-autonomous proinflammatory response. We validated the efficacy of selected candidate COVID-19 drugs confirming that Remdesivir strongly suppressed viral infection/replication. We provide a relevant platform for studying COVID-19 pathobiology and for rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2 and future emergent respiratory pathogens.

SARS-Co-V-2 viral genomes were detected and sequenced from 18 Romanian patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019. Viral Spike S glycoprotein sequences were used to generate model structures and assess the role of mutations on protein stability. We integrated the phylogenetic tree within the available European SARS-Co-V-2 genomic sequences.

583,Phosphorylation modulates liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1–3. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7–11. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12–15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Carlson, C.

Because most human antibodies against the RBD neutralized the virus by inhibiting host cell entry, we selected one of these clonotypes and demonstrated that it could potently inhibit viral replication. Interestingly, these VH clonotypes pre-existed in six of 10 healthy individuals, predominantly as IgM isotypes, which could explain the expeditious and stereotypic development of these clonotypes among SARS-CoV-2 patients.One Sentence Summary Stereotypic-naïve SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody clonotypes, encoded by IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6, were identified in most patients and pre-exist in the majority of the healthy population, predominantly as an IgM isotype.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Kim, S.

586,Assessment of the use and quick preparation of saliva for rapid microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19.,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of direct real time RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in heated saliva samples, avoiding the RNA isolation step. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs together with saliva samples were obtained from 51 patients clinically diagnosed as potentially having COVID-19. Two different methods were compared: 1. RNA was extracted from 500 l of sample using a MagNA Pure Compact Instrument with an elution volume of 50l and 2. 700{micro}L of saliva were heat-inactivated at 96{degrees}C for 15 minutes, and directly subjected to RT-PCR. One step real time RT-PCR was performed using 5 l of extracted RNA or directly from 5 l of heated sample. RT-PCR was performed targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene region. Diagnostic performance was assessed using the results of the RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 81.08%, 92.86%, 96.77% and 65.00%, respectively when RNA extraction was included in the protocol with saliva, whereas sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83.78%, 92.86%, 68.42% and 96.88%, respectively, for the heat-inactivation protocol. However, when the analysis was performed exclusively on saliva samples with a limited time from the onset of symptoms (<9 days, N=28), these values were 90%, 87.5%, 44% and 98.75% for the heat-inactivation protocol.

587,Rational Design of the Remdesivir Binding Site in the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Potential Resistance,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Padhi, A.; Shukla, R.; Tripathi, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
588,Role of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different cohorts: Can they provide clues for appropriate patient triaging?,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a major global health crisis. Currently, diagnosis is based on molecular techniques, which detect the viral nucleic acids when present at detectable levels. The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay. Among the 18 patients that were positive for serum IgG, 13 (72.2%) exhibited 1-3 symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 (27.7%) patients did not present with any COVID-19 related symptoms, per CDC criteria. All 4 (100%) patients that were positive by rRT-PCR had symptoms of COVID-19 disease. A longitudinal study from the inpatient population suggested there was a sharp increase in the serum IgG titers in 5 patients, a moderate increase in 1 patient and a plateau in 3 patients. Sero-prevalence of COVID-19 disease in pre-procedure patients was 5.5%. Our findings suggest serological tests can be used for appropriate patient triaging when performed as an adjunct to existing molecular testing.","Mutnal, M. B.; Mohammad, A. A.; Arroliga, A.

589,Comprehensive annotations of the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a fast and accurate pipeline,"In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain).

590,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and boosts proinflammatory activity,"ABSTRACTThere is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

We systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sekine, T.; Perez-Potti, A.; Rivera-Ballesteros, O.; Straling, K.; Gorin, J.-B.; Olsson, A.; Llewellyn-Lacey, S.; Kamal, H.; Bogdanovic, G.; Muschiol, S.; Wulliman, D.

Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is sufficient to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damage in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 2-E protein induced rapid pyroptosis-like cell death in various susceptible cells and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen. Overexpressed 2-E protein formed cation channels in host cell membranes, eventually leading to membrane rupture. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo.

However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others.

There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Luzes, R.; Muzi-Filho, H.; Pereira-Acacio, A.; Crisostomo, T.; Vieyra, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
596,Perversely expressed long noncoding RNAs can alter host response and viral proliferation in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundSince December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.

ResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.

ConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","Turjya, R.

597,"Integrate Structural Analysis, Isoform Diversity, and Interferon-Inductive Propensity of ACE2 to Refine SARS-CoV2 Susceptibility Prediction in Vertebrates","The current new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused globally near 0.4/6 million confirmed deaths/infected cases across more than 200 countries. As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, E.

598,A facile Q-RT-PCR assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has infected millions within just a few months and is continuing to spread around the globe causing immense respiratory disease and mortality. Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.

ImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.","Shema Mugisha, C.; Vuong, H.

599,Glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Control the Receptor Binding Domain Conformation,"The glycan shield of the beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) Spike (S) glycoprotein provides protection from host immune responses, acting as a steric block to potentially neutralizing antibody responses. The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Henderson, R.; Edwards, R.
