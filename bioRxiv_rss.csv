0,Production of Trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein by CHO Cells for Serological COVID-19 Testing,"We describe scalable and cost-efficient production of full length, His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer by CHO cells that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient sera at high specificity and sensitivity. Transient production of spike in both HEK and CHO cells mediated by PEI was increased significantly (up to 10.9-fold) by a reduction in culture temperature to 32C to permit extended duration cultures. Based on these data GS-CHO pools stably producing spike trimer under the control of a strong synthetic promoter were cultured in hypothermic conditions with combinations of bioactive small molecules to increase yield of purified spike product 4.9-fold to 53 mg/L. Purification of recombinant spike by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography initially yielded a variety of co-eluting protein impurities identified as host cell-derived by mass spectrometry, which were separated from spike trimer using a modified imidazole gradient elution. Purified CHO spike trimer antigen was used in ELISA format to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in sera from patient cohorts previously tested for viral infection by PCR, including those who had displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The antibody assay, validated to ISO 15189 Medical Laboratories standards, exhibited a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 92.3%. Our data show that CHO cells are a suitable host for the production of larger quantities of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimer which can be used as antigen for mass serological testing.","Johari, Y.

1,"Face masks release water vapour, but where does it go? An early observational study","Introduction: The aim of this observational study was to demonstrate the behaviour and trajectory of exhaled material from an individual wearing an FFP3 mask. Valves allow material release, but we theorised that valve design may direct material downwards towards patient and surrounding environment. Limiting transmission of diseases with aerosolised spread is a current and serious concern within healthcare worldwide. Filtering face piece masks (FFP) are an essential piece of protective equipment when treating patients with ongoing infection. However, valved masks in other settings such as elective theatre and by the general public may have unforeseen negative effects. Methods: A heating coil-based vaporiser was used to produce visible water vapour. A healthy test subject was then filmed wearing a variety of different masks and exhaling the water vapour. Results: Flexible pleated and solid-shell FFP masks direct exhaled material downwards in plumes exceeding 25 cm. Duckbill-shaped masks appear to direct exhaled vapour laterally, with a smaller plume. The effect is influenced by mask design and type of valve. Fluid repellent surgical masks reduce material directed downwards, and when used in conjunction with an FFP3 mask, appear to reduce the size and density of the exhaled vapour plume. The use of a visor was ineffective in reducing plume expulsion. Conclusion: A properly fit-tested FFP3-rated protective mask may only moderately limit expulsion of aerosolised particles from asymptomatic healthcare workers to patients, particularly in cases where procedures are being performed in close proximity to patients or in cases where mucosal surfaces are exposed. Further research in this area is needed.","Stubington, T.; Sahota, R.; Mottacki, N.; Johnston, M.; Judd, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20154435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20154435v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
2,COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a National Healthcare System: the Qatar Experience,"The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and over 28,000 employees. A total of 16,912 staff members were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 10 and June 24, 2020 with 1,799 (10.6%) testing positive. Nurses and midwives had the highest number of infections (33.2% of all infected HCWs) followed by non-clinical support service staff (31.3%), administrative staff (14.6%), allied health professionals (12.7%), physicians (5.2% and other clinical support staff (2.9%). Among 671 infected HCW surveyed by the infection prevention and control team immediately after the positive COVID-19 test was reported, exposure to a family member or roommate with confirmed infection each were reported by 9.5%. Two-thirds of the infected HCWs were symptomatic with fever (34.6%), cough (32.2%) and sore throat (15.8%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. Among the survey respondents, 78 (11.6%) were hospitalized, 9 (1.3%) required supplemental oxygen, 4 (0.6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit) and 2 (0.3%) required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. To understand the transmission dynamics and impact of facility designation as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 facility, we conducted a focused follow-up telephone survey on 393 COVID-19 positive HCW 1-6 weeks after diagnosis. Only 5% of respondents reported acquiring the virus from working at a COVID-19 designated facility while the remaining 95% reported working at a non-COVID-19 facility and acquired the infection from accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or to a patient (29%). Among infected HCW at COVID-19 designated facilities, 82% reported used full PPE at all times while 68% of infected HCW at non-COVID-19 facilities reported using PPE as directed.","Alajmi, J.; Jeremijenko, A.

3,"A city-level analysis of air pollution, climate and COVID-19 early spread during the Spanish lockdown","The COVID-19 outbreak has escalated into the worse pandemic of the present century. The rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused devastating health and economic crises all over the world, with Spain being one of the worst affected countries in terms of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per inhabitant. In this situation, the Spanish Government declared the lockdown of the country with the aim of flattening the epidemic curve. The variations of air pollution in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in 8 cities of Spain are analyzed here considering the effect of meteorology during the COVID-19 lockdown period (from March 15th to April 12th 2020). The results of the analysis show that the 4-week Spanish lockdown was not long enough to reduce the PM2.5 levels in all the cities considered. These reductions were less than those expected, despite the drastically reduced human activity. Furthermore, no associations between COVID-19 accumulated cases and PM2.5 exposure or environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunlight hours, maximum pressure) were found during the early spread of the pandemic.","Briz-Redon, A.; Belenguer-Sapina, C.; Serrano-Aroca, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171041v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171041v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
4,Effects of universal masking on Massachusetts healthcare workers' COVID-19 incidence,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) and other essential workers are at risk for occupational infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several infection control strategies have been implemented. Particularly, evidence shows that universal masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by secular trend bias. Aims: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence among HCWs compared to the general community population. Methods: We compared the 7-day averaged incidence rates between a Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period was from March 17 (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to May 6 (the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system implemented universal masking on March 26, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset, and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was April 20. Thus, we categorized March 17-31 as the pre-intervention phase, April 1-20 the intervention phase, and April 21-May 6 the post-intervention phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression models. Results: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system and the state in both the pre- and post-intervention phases. During the intervention phase, the healthcare system's epidemic slope became negative (standardized {beta}: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.31), while Massachusetts' slope remained positive (standardized {beta}: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.05). Conclusions: Universal masking at the healthcare system was associated with flattening the COVID-19 curve among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to rise in the surrounding community.","Lan, F.-Y.; Christophi, C.

5,Deciphering the state of immune silence in fatal COVID-19 patients,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 has appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to immune silence in patients facing death.","Bost, P.; De Sanctis, F.; Cane, S.; Ugel, S.; Donadello, K.; Castellucci, M.; Eyal, D.; Fiore, A.; Anselmi, C.; Barouni, R.

6,Protocol for a Rapid Scoping Review of Evidence of Outdoor Transmission of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK. As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate mass gatherings, particularly mass participation sports events such as running, but also events in other sectors such as concerts, carnivals and festivals. This paper sets out a protocol for a rapid scoping review of evidence of incidents of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, including the settings, environments and circumstances of such transmission, and their comparative prevalence to incidents of indoor transmission. Its purpose is to inform discussions about the recommencement of activities that generate mass gatherings.","Weed, M.; Foad, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170373v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170373v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
7,Acute Lung injury evolution in Covid-19,"BACKGROUND Pathogenesis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is poorly understood. Most histologic studies come from post-mortem analysis, with existing data indicating that histologic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome are typically present in fatal cases. However, this observation may be misleading, due to confounding factors in pre-terminal disease, including injury resulting from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Ante-mortem lung biopsy may provide major pathogenetic insights, potentially providing a basis for novel treatment approaches. AIM This comparative, multicenter, prospective, observational study was planned to identify ante-mortem histological profile and immunohistochemical features of lung tissue in patients with Covid-19 in early and late phases of the disease, including markers of inflammatory cells and major pathways involved in the cytokine storm triggering. METHODS Enrolled patients underwent lung biopsy, according to the study protocol approved by local Ethical Committee, either within 15 days of the first symptoms appearing (early phase) or after > 15 days (more advanced disease). Key exclusion criteria were excessive or uncorrectable bleeding risk and cardiovascular disease with heart failure. Lung samples were obtained by conventional trans-bronchialbiopsy, trans-bronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy. RESULTS 23 patients were enrolled: 12 patients underwent lung biopsy within 15 days and 11 patients more than 15 days after the onset of symptoms. Early biopsies were characterized by spots of patchy acute lung injury (ALI) with alveolar type II cells hyperplasia and significant vascular abnormalities (disordered angiogenesis with alveolar capillary hyperplasia, luminal enlargement and thickened walls of pulmonary venules, perivascularCD4-T-cell infiltration), with no hyaline membranes. In the later stages, the alveolar architecture appeared disrupted, with areas of organizing ALI, venular congestion and capillary thromboembolic microangiopathy. Striking phenotypic features were demonstrated in hyper plastic pneumocytes and endothelial cells, including the expression of phospho-STAT3 and molecules involved in immunoinhibitory signals (PD-L1 and IDO1). Alveolar macrophages exhibited macrophage-related markers (CD68, CD11c, CD14) together with unusual markers, such as DC-Lamp/CD208, CD206, CD123/IL3AR. CONCLUSION A morphologically distinct Covid pattern was identified in the earlier stages of the disease, with prominent epithelial and endothelial cell abnormalities, that may be potentially reversible, differing strikingly from findings in classical diffuse alveolar damage. These observations may have major therapeutic implications, justifying studies of early interventions aimed at mitigating inflammatory organ injury.","Doglioni, C.; Ravaglia, C.; Rossi, G.; Dubini, A.; Pedica, F.; Piciucchi, S.; Vizzuso, A.; Pecciarini, L.; Stella, F.; Maitan, S.; Agnoletti, V.; Gamberini, E.; Russo, E.; Puglisi, S.; Arcadu, A.; Donati, L.; Di Cesare, S.; Grosso, C.; Poletti, G.; Sambri, V.; Fabbri, E.; Pizzolo, G.; Ugel, S.; Bronte, V.; Wells, A.

8,ApharSeq: An Extraction-free Early-Pooling Protocol for Massively Multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 Detection,"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to a steep increase in the need for viral detection tests worldwide. Most current tests for SARS-CoV-2 are based on RNA extraction followed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assays that involve a separate RNA extraction and qPCR reaction for each sample with a fixed cost and reaction time. While automation and improved logistics can increase the capacity of these tests, they cannot exceed this lower bound dictated by one extraction and reaction per sample. Multiplexed next generation sequencing (NGS) assays provide a dramatic increase in throughput, and hold the promise of richer information on viral strains and host immune response. Here, we establish a significant improvement of existing RNA-seq detection protocols. Our workflow, ApharSeq, includes a fast and cheap RNA capture step, that is coupled to barcoding of individual samples, followed by sample-pooling prior to the reverse transcription, PCR and massively parallel sequencing. Thus, only one step is performed before pooling hundreds of barcoded samples for subsequent steps and further analysis. We characterize the quantitative aspects of the assay, and test ApharSeq on dozens of clinical samples in a robotic workflow. Our proposed workflow is estimated to reduce costs by 10-50 fold, labor by 5-100 fold, automated liquid handling by 5-10 fold, and reagent requirements by 100-1000 fold compared to existing testing methods.","Chappleboim, A.; Joseph-Strauss, D.; Rahat, A.; Sharkia, I.; Adam, M.; Kitsberg, D.; Fialkoff, G.; Lotem, M.; Gershon, O.; Schmidtner, A.-K.; Oiknine-Djian, E.; Klochendler, A.; Sadeh, R.; Dor, Y.; Wolf, D.; Habib, N.; Friedman, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.08.20170746v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.08.20170746v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
9,COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases: A random cross-sectional telephonic survey,"Objective. To describe the incidence, clinical course, and predictive factors of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in a cohort of rheumatological patients residing in New Delhi (National Capital Region), India. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional, random telephonic survey from 20th April to 20th July 2020 on patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients were interviewed with a predesigned questionnaire. The incidence of COVID-19 in the general population was obtained from open access government data repository. Report of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction report was taken as confirmatory of COVID-19 infection. Results. Among the 900 contacted patients 840 responded (713 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 100 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 20 with spondylarthritis (SpA) and 7 with others; mean age 45 years, mean duration 11.3 years; 86% female). Among them 29 reported flu-like symptoms and four RA patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. All of them were hospitalized with uneventful recovery. Rheumatological drugs were discontinued during the infectious episode. Disease modifying agents and biologics were equally received by those with or without COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was similar to general Delhi population (0.476% vs 0.519% respectively, p=0.86). Two patients had relapse of rheumatic disease after recovery. After recovery from COVID-19 or Flu-like illness, eight patients (27.6%, 95% confidence interval 14.7-45.7) reported disease flare. Conclusion. Patients with rheumatic diseases in India have similar incidence of COVID-19 infection compared to the community. Relapse of underlying rheumatic disease after recovery is not uncommon and continuation of glucocorticoid through the infection should be considered.","Kumar, U.; Goswami, R.

10,The Link between Poverty and COVID-19 Case and Mortality Rates in Germany,"The effects of poverty on the case and mortality rates of Covid-19 has emerged as a controversial but understudied topic. In previous studies and reports from the UK and US evidence emerged that poverty related indicators had a significant statistical effect on case and mortality rates on district level. For Germany, it has largely been assumed that poverty is an equally relevant factor influencing the transmission rates of the outbreak mostly due to anecdotal evidence from local outbreaks in meat processing plants and reported incidents in poorer city districts. This paper addresses the lack of statistical evidence and investigates thoroughly the link between poverty related indicators and case and mortality rates of the outbreak using multivariate, multilevel regression while also considering the urban-rural divide of the country. As proxies for poverty the unemployment rate, the per capita presence of general practitioners (physicians), per capita GDP, and the rate of employees with no professional job training is evaluated in relation to the accumulated case and mortality numbers on district level taken from RKI data of June and July 2020. Interestingly, the study finds no evidence for a poverty-related effect on mortality for German districts. Furthermore, only employment in low qualification jobs approximated by the job training variable consistently affected case numbers in urban districts in the expected direction.","Ettensperger, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171207v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171207v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
11,Predicting the future SARS-COV-2 reproductive rate.,"Aims To generate a predictive model for the SARS-COV-2 viral reproductive rate, based on government policy and weather parameters. Methods A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed for each country using lockdown stringency (Oxford University tracker), temperature and humidity, for the 1st 110 days of 2020. This was validated by extrapolating to the following 51 days, and comparing the predicted viral rate and cumulative mortality with WHO data. The country models was extrapolated to July 2021 using projected weather forecast for four scenarios; continuing with the 11/6/2020 lockdown policy, 100% lockdown, 20% lockdown and no lockdown. Results From pooled data (40 countries), lockdown stringency had a strong negative correlation with log10viral reproductive rate (-0.648 at 21 days later). Maximum temperature correlated at -0.14, 14 days later and humidity correlated at +0.25, 22 days later. Predictive Models were generated for 11 countries using multivariate regression of these parameters. The R2 correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.817 to 0.987 for the model generation period. For the validation period, the Pearson's coefficient of correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.529 to 0.984 and for cumulative mortality from 0.980 to 1.000. Forward extrapolation of these models for 5 nations, demonstrate, that removing the lockdown will result in rapid spread of the disease ranging from as soon as July 2020 for Russia, UK, Italy and India to January 2021 for the USA. The current (11/6/20) lockdown in the USA, Spain, UK, France, Germany, Turkey can control the disease but other nations will need to intensify their lockdowns to prevent future resurgence. Most nations will require more stringent lockdowns in January than in July. Conclusion The viral reproductive rate is highly predicted by a combination of lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity. Country specific predictive models can provide useful forecast of policy requirements.","Papadopoulos, D. I.; Ellis, D.

12,Factors Associated with Disease Severity and Mortality among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Understanding the factors associated with disease severity and mortality in Coronavirus disease (COVID19) is imperative to effectively triage patients. We performed a systematic review to determine the demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological factors associated with severity and mortality in COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and WHO database for English language articles from inception until May 8, 2020. We included Observational studies with direct comparison of clinical characteristics between a) patients who died and those who survived or b) patients with severe disease and those without severe disease. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two authors independently. Results: Among 15680 articles from the literature search, 109 articles were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality was higher in patients with increasing age, male gender (RR 1.45; 95%CI 1.23,1.71), dyspnea (RR 2.55; 95%CI 1.88,2.46), diabetes (RR 1.59; 95%CI 1.41,1.78), hypertension (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.69,2.15). Congestive heart failure (OR 4.76; 95%CI 1.34,16.97), hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 8.34; 95%CI 2.57,27.08), bilateral lung involvement (OR 4.86; 95%CI 3.19,7.39) and reticular pattern (OR 5.54; 95%CI 1.24,24.67) were associated with severe disease. Clinically relevant cut-offs for leukocytosis(>10.0 x109/L), lymphopenia(< 1.1 x109/L), elevated C-reactive protein(>100mg/L), LDH(>250U/L) and D-dimer(>1mg/L) had higher odds of severe disease and greater risk of mortality. Conclusion: Knowledge of the factors associated of disease severity and mortality identified in our study may assist in clinical decision-making and critical-care resource allocation for patients with COVID-19.","Chidambaram, V.; Tun, N.

13,Estimating the Impact of COVID-19 on the Individual Lifespan:A Conceptual Detour and an Empirical Shortcut,"The impact of COVID-19 on the individual lifespan can be measured by the difference in period life expectancy at birth (PLEB), an intuitive indicator of mortality conditions during a reference period. When mortality conditions are changing rapidly, however, that intuitive interpretation of the PLEB for short reference periods and of its change conflict with the assumptions under which the PLEB is derived. To avoid assumptions about future mortality, I propose measuring instead the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL), defined as the average difference between the actual and otherwise expected ages at death in a recent death cohort. For fine-grained tracking of the pandemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. I estimate quarterly MUL values for the first half of 2020 in 142 national populations and 91 sub-national populations in Italy, Spain and the US. Across countries, the highest quarterly values were reached in the second quarter in Peru (3.90 years) and in Ecuador (4.59 years). Higher quarterly values still were found in New York and New Jersey, where individuals died respectively 5.41 and 5.56 years younger on average than their expected age at death. Using a seven-day rolling window, I estimate the MUL peaked at 7.32 years in Lombardy, 8.96 years in Madrid, and 8.93 years in New York, but reached 12.86 years for the entire month of April in Guayas (Ecuador). These results illustrate how the MUL provides an intuitive metric to track the pandemic without requiring assumptions about future mortality.","Heuveline, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171264v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171264v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
14,A highly specific assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients,"Gaining detailed insights into the role of host immune responses in viral clearance is critical for understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis and future treatment strategies. While studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol, designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific Memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 days of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, IFN-{gamma}). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 of 9 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least one of 12 analyzed viral antigens and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. While some antigens were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Membrane protein was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 unexposed healthy individuals. We are presenting a highly specific protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Our data confirmed the important role of cellular immune responses in understanding SARS-CoV-2 clearance. We showed that Spike is the most immunogenic antigen. We have introduced Membrane protein as interesting target for studying humoral immune responses in convalescent COVID-19 patients.","Zelba, H.; Worbs, D.; Harter, J.; Pieper, N.; Kyzirakos-Feger, C.; Kayser, S.; Seibold, M.; Bartsch, O.; Koedding, J.; Biskup, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20150060v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20150060v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
15,COVID-19 mild cases determination from   correlating COVID-line calls to reported cases,"One of the most challenging keys to understand COVID-19 evolution is to have a measure on those mild cases which are never tested because their few symptoms are soft and/or fade away soon. The problem is not only that they are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation. We present a novel and simple algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line phone calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population. We present the plain mathematics of the method and as a working example we apply it to Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), where it is being currently used. The implementation of this algorithm by other regions would be straightforward and would provide compelling information to the corresponding Health Care Administration.","Alvarez, E.; Marsico, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162008v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162008v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True

17,"Transmission heterogeneities, kinetics, and controllability of SARS-CoV-2","A long-standing question in infectious disease dynamics is the role of transmission heterogeneities, particularly those driven by demography, behavior and interventions. Here we characterize transmission risk between 1,178 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and their 15,648 close contacts based on detailed contact tracing data from Hunan, China. We find that 80% of secondary transmissions can be traced back to 14% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicating substantial transmission heterogeneities. Regression analysis suggests a marked gradient of transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions, after adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Population-level physical distancing measures confine transmission to families and households; while case isolation and contact quarantine reduce transmission in all settings. Adjusted for interventions, the reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 infection peaks just before symptom presentation, with ~50% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic phase. Modelling results indicate that achieving SARS-CoV-2 control would require the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level physical distancing measures, owing to the particular transmission kinetics of this virus.","Sun, K.; Wang, W.; Gao, L.; Wang, Y.; Luo, K.; Ren, L.; Zhan, Z.; Chen, X.; Zhao, S.; Huang, Y.; Sun, Q.; Liu, Z.; Litvinova, M.; Vespignani, A.; Ajelli, M.; Viboud, C.; Yu, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171132v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.20171132v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,True
18,The impact of COVID-19 on Italy web users: a quantitative analysis of regional hygiene interest and emotional response,"Background: Between the end of February and the beginning of June 2020, Italy was certainly one of the most affected countries in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, the web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze quantitatively the impact of COVID-19 on web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects, as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian web user in the international, national, and regional COVID-19 situation. By doing so, from the analysis of web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research we used the ""Google Trends"" tool, which returns normalized values, called ""relative search volume"" (RSV), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy has waned, as has the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). Anyway, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international nor regional level. Between 20 February and 10 June, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116 and 901% respectively compared to those from 1 January to 19 February, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until 10 June, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms ""fear"" and ""anxiety"" grew by 8 and 21% respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period 1 January, 2018 - 29 December, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: The Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of the online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we have found cyclical correlations with research related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

19,Rapid endothelialitis and vascular inflammation characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung-on-chip model,"BackgroundSevere manifestations of COVID-19 include hypercoagulopathies and systemic endothelialitis. The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.

MethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.

InterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.

20,The impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission across 130 countries and territories,"Introduction: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Y.; Morgenstern, C.; Kelly, J.; Lowe, R.; CMMID COVID-19 Working Group,; Jit, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172643v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172643v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,True

22,"A ""Tail"" of Two Cities: Fatality-based Modeling of COVID-19 Evolution in New York City and Cook County, IL","I describe SIR modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in two U.S. urban environments, New York City (NYC) and Cook County, IL, from onset through the month of June, 2020. Since testing was not widespread early in the pandemic in the U.S., I do not use data on confirmed cases and rely solely on public fatality data to estimate model parameters. Fits to the first 20 days of data determine a degenerate combination of the basic reproduction number, R0, and the mean time to removal from the infectious population, 1/{gamma} with {gamma}(R0 - 1) = 0.25(0.21) inverse days for NYC (Cook County). Equivalently, the initial doubling time was td = 2.8(3.4) days for NYC (Cook). The early fatality data suggest that both locations had infections in early February. I model the mitigation measures implemented in mid-March in both locations (distancing, quarantine, isolation, etc) via a time-dependent reproduction number Rt that declines monotonically from R0 to a smaller asymptotic value, with a parameterized functional form. The timing (mid-March) and duration (several days) of the transitions in Rt appear well determined by the data. However, the fatality data determine only a degenerate combination of the parameters R0, the percentage reduction in social contact due to mitigation measures, X, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), f . With flat priors, based on simulations the NYC model parameters have 95.45% credible intervals of R0 = 3.0 - 5.4, X = 80 - 99.9% and f = 2 - 6%, with 5 - 13% of the population asymptotically infected. A strong external prior indicating a lower value of f or of 1/{gamma} would imply lower values of R0 and X and higher percentage infection of the population. For Cook County, the evolution was qualitatively different: after mitigation measures were implemented, the daily fatality counts reached a plateau for about a month before tailing off. This is consistent with an SIR model that exhibits ""critical slowing-down"", in which Rt plateaus at a value just above unity. For Cook County, the 95.45% credible intervals for the model parameters are much broader and shifted downward, R0 = 1.4 - 4.7, X = 26 - 54%, and f = 0.1 - 0.6% with 15 - 88% of the population asymptotically infected. Despite the apparently lower efficacy of its social contact reduction measures, Cook County has had significantly fewer fatalities per population than NYC, D{infty}/N = 100 vs. 270 per 100,000. In the model, this is attributed to the lower inferred IFR for Cook; an external prior pointing to similar values of the IFR for the two locations would instead chalk up the difference in D/N to differences in the relative growth rate of the disease. I derive a model-dependent threshold, Xcrit, for ""safe"" re-opening, that is, for easing of contact reduction that would not trigger a second wave; for NYC, the models predict that increasing social contact by more than 20% from post-mitigation levels will lead to renewed spread, while for Cook County the threshold value is very uncertain, given the parameter degeneracies. The timing of 2nd-wave growth will depend on the amplitude of contact increase relative to Xcrit and on the asymptotic growth rate, and the impact in terms of fatalities will depend on the parameter f .","Frieman, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20170506v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20170506v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,True
23,High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in care homes affected by COVID-19; a prospective cohort study in England,"Background: We investigated six London care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak and found very high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff. Here we report follow-up serological analysis in these care homes five weeks later. Methods: Residents and staff had a convalescent blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralising antibodies by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR five weeks after the primary COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Results: Of the 518 residents and staff in the initial investigation, 208/241 (86.3%) surviving residents and 186/254 (73.2%) staff underwent serological testing. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive residents and staff were antibody positive five weeks later, whether symptomatic (residents 35/35, 100%; staff, 22/22, 100%) or asymptomatic (residents 32/33, 97.0%; staff 21/22, 95.1%). Symptomatic but SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative residents and staff also had high seropositivity rates (residents 23/27, 85.2%; staff 18/21, 85.7%), as did asymptomatic RT-PCR negative individuals (residents 62/92, 67.3%; staff 95/143, 66.4%). Neutralising antibody was present in 118/132 (89.4%) seropositive individuals and was not associated with age or symptoms. Ten residents (10/108, 9.3%) remained RT-PCR positive, but with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold values; all 7 tested were seropositive. New infections were detected in three residents and one staff member. Conclusions: RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 significantly underestimates the true extent of an outbreak in institutional settings. Elderly frail residents and younger healthier staff were equally able to mount robust and neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. More than two-thirds of residents and staff members had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of their nasal swab RT-PCR positivity or symptoms status.","Ladhani, S.

24,Low awareness of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy adults,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenges governments worldwide to balance appropriate virus control measures and their societal and economic consequences. These control measures include the identification, isolation and testing of potentially infected individuals. As this relies on an individual's awareness of infection, we investigated the extent to which healthy adults suspected having had COVID-19, and how COVID-19 suspicion and symptoms relate to antibodies indicative of a past infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods and findings Individuals donating plasma anywhere in the Netherlands between May 11th and 18th were screened for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA and invited to participate in an online questionnaire about COVID-19-related symptoms and awareness. Antibody and questionnaire data were complete for 3,676 individuals, including 239 (6.5%) that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here, we show that a 38% of the individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reported having had no or only very mild symptoms at any time during the peak of the epidemic. The loss of taste and/or smell in particular was significantly associated with seropositivity, independent of age and sex. Forty-eight percent of antibody-positive persons did not suspect having had COVID-19, in spite of most of them reporting symptoms. Conclusions Awareness of infection was low among individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, even at the peak of the epidemic.

25,Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Lung Organoids: a Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Drug Test,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication, assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","Pei, R.; Feng, J.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, H.; Li, L.; Yang, X.; He, J.; Xiao, S.; Xiong, J.; Lin, Y.; Wen, K.; Zhou, H.; Chen, J.; Rong, Z.; Chen, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
26,Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2,"A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is urgently needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","Walls, A.

27,TRIM28 regulates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by targeting ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into human cells. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs. Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","Wang, Y.; Fan, Y.; Huang, Y.; Du, T.; Liu, Z.; Huang, D.; Wang, Y.; Wang, N.; Zhang, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247825v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247825v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
28,Oncologic Immunomodulatory Agents in Patients with Cancer and COVID-19,"Background Corticosteroids, anti-CD20 agents, immunotherapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapy are commonly used in the treatment of patients with cancer. How these agents impact patients with cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N=820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19. To address that more acutely ill patients receive therapeutic corticosteroids, we examined patient subsets based on different levels of respiratory support: <=2 L/min supplemental oxygen, >2L/min supplemental oxygen, and advanced respiratory support prior to death. Results Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes in the pre-2L supplemental oxygen cohort; no statistically significant difference was observed in the >2L/min supplemental oxygen and post-critical cohorts. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were lower, and ferritin levels were higher, after corticosteroid administration. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19. In the absence of prospective studies and evidence-based guidelines, our data may aid providers looking to assess the risks and benefits of these agents in caring for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era.","Jee, J.; Stonestrom, A.

29,Suppression of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses by NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.","Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Wang, P.; Li, X.; Kuang, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
30,Efficacy of Targeting SARS-CoV-2 by CAR-NK Cells,"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is one of greatest global pandemics in history. No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus, off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Ma, M.

31,Discovery of COVID-19 Inhibitors Targeting the SARS-CoV2 Nsp13 Helicase,"The raging COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 has infected millions of people and killed several hundred thousand patients worldwide. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating coronavirus infections. In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved non-structural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP binding site. Importantly, two of our top drug hits have significant activity in inhibiting purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 helicase, providing hope that these drugs can be potentially repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.","White, M.

32,Worldwide tracing of mutations and the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.","Zhou, Z.-Y.; Liu, H.; Zhang, Y.-D.; Wu, Y.-Q.; Peng, M.-S.; Li, A.; Irwin, D.

33,Stochastic extinction of epidemics: how long does would it take for Sars-Cov-2 to die out?,"Worldwide, we are currently in an unprecedented situation with regard to the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, where countries are using isolation and lock-down measures to control the spread of infection. This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I&#134 = 1/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.","Khatri, B.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted by reviewing charts and slides of placentas between April 1 to July 24, 2020. Clinical history of COVID-19 were searched in Pathology Database (CoPath). Controls were matched with SARS-CoV-2-negative women with singleton deliveries in the 3rd-trimester. Individual and group, pathological features were extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one 3rd-trimester, placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and compared to 20 placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no significant differences in individual or group gross or microscopic pathological features between the groups. Within the SARS-CoV-2+ group, there are no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion: Placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not demonstrate a specific pathological pattern. Pregnancy complicated with COVID-19 during the 3rd trimester does not have a demonstrable effect on placental structure and pathology.","He, M.; Skaria, P.; Kreutz, K.; Chen, L.; Hagemann, I.; Carter, E.

35,High prevalence of symptoms among Brazilian subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: a nationwide household survey,"Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, there has been a widespread assumption that most infected persons are asymptomatic. A frequently-cited early study from China suggested that 86% of all infections were undocumented, which was used as indirect evidence that patients were asymptomatic. Using data from the most recent wave of the EPICOVID19 study, a nationwide household-based survey including 133 cities from all states of Brazil, we estimated the proportion of people with and without antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic, which symptoms were most frequently reported, the number of symptoms reported and the association between symptomatology and socio-demographic characteristics. We were able to test 33,205 subjects using a rapid antibody test that was previously validated. Information on symptoms was collected before participants received the test result. Out of 849 (2.7%) participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, only 12.1% (95%CI 10.1-14.5) reported no symptoms since the start of the pandemic, compared to 42.2% (95%CI 41.7-42.8) among those who tested negative. The largest difference between the two groups was observed for changes in smell or taste (56.5% versus 9.1%, a 6.2-fold difference). Symptoms change in smell or taste, fever and myalgia were most likely to predict positive test results as suggested by recursive partitioning tree analysis. Among individuals without any of these three symptoms (74.2% of the sample), only 0.8% tested positive, compared to 18.3% of those with both fever and changes in smell or taste.

36,Membrane Nanoparticles Derived from ACE2-rich Cells Block SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic worldwide necessitates the development of novel effective agents against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells. Our study demonstrates a easy-to-achieve membrane nano-antagonist for curbing SARS-CoV-2, which enriches the existing antiviral arsenal and provides new possibilities to treat COVID-19.","Wang, C.; Wang, S.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, J.; Han, S.; Zhao, G.; Kang, J.; Liu, Y.; Wang, L.; Wang, X.; Xu, Y.; Wang, S.; Huang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhao, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247338v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247338v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False

For this reason, we decide to describe preliminary data showing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in children with known household exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, our report shows that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high in both adults and children, with similar rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all age groups, including the younger children. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In particular, 16 (59,26%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28 (52,83%) of pediatric contacts (P > 0.05).

Adult partners and children also had a probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Interestingly, 35.7% of children and 33.3% of adults with SARS-CoV-2 IgG were previously diagnosed as COVID-19 cases. Since this evidence of high rate of IgG in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 has public health implication, with this comment we highlight the need of establishing appropriate guidelines for school opening and other social activities related to childhood.","buonsenso, d.; Valentini, P.; De Rose, C.; Pata, D.; Sinatti, D.; Speziale, D.; Ricci, R.; Carfi, A.; Landi, F.; Sanguinetti, M.; Sali, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20169912v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20169912v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,True

On 22 March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help flatten the curve. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. Methods: An online survey was open from the 23 April 2020 to the 11 May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (including 95% confidence intervals) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. Results: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18 to 29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; difference=6.4%; 95%CI: 3.6, 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=-3.3%; 95%CI: -7.0, -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95%CI:-26.9, -19.8). Solo sex activities increased, 14.6% (123/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; difference= -14.8%; 95%CI: -17.6, -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95%CI:1.0, 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95%CI:10.1, 19.2) increased during lockdown.

39,Effect of Convalescent Plasma on Mortality among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: Initial Three-Month Experience,"Importance: Passive antibody transfer is a longstanding treatment strategy for infectious diseases that involve the respiratory system. In this context, human convalescent plasma has been used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the efficacy remains uncertain. Objective: To explore potential signals of efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Design: Open-label, Expanded Access Program (EAP) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with human convalescent plasma. Setting: Multicenter, including 2,807 acute care facilities in the US and territories. Participants: Adult participants enrolled and transfused under the purview of the US Convalescent Plasma EAP program between April 4 and July 4, 2020 who were hospitalized with (or at risk of) severe or life threatening acute COVID-19 respiratory syndrome. Intervention: Transfusion of at least one unit of human COVID-19 convalescent plasma using standard transfusion guidelines at any time during hospitalization. Convalescent plasma was donated by recently-recovered COVID-19 survivors, and the antibody levels in the units collected were unknown at the time of transfusion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seven and thirty-day mortality. Results: The 35,322 transfused patients had heterogeneous demographic and clinical characteristics. This cohort included a high proportion of critically-ill patients, with 52.3% in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 27.5% receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of plasma transfusion. The seven-day mortality rate was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused 4 or more days after diagnosis (p<0.001). Similar findings were observed in 30-day mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). Importantly, a gradient of mortality was seen in relation to IgG antibody levels in the transfused plasma. For patients who received high IgG plasma (>18.45 S/Co), seven-day mortality was 8.9% (6.8%, 11.7%); for recipients of medium IgG plasma (4.62 to 18.45 S/Co) mortality was 11.6% (10.3%, 13.1%); and for recipients of low IgG plasma (<4.62 S/Co) mortality was 13.7% (11.1%, 16.8%) (p=0.048). This unadjusted dose-response relationship with IgG was also observed in thirty-day mortality (p=0.021). The pooled relative risk of mortality among patients transfused with high antibody level plasma units was 0.65 [0.47-0.92] for 7 days and 0.77 [0.63-0.94] for 30 days compared to low antibody level plasma units. Conclusions and Relevance: The relationships between reduced mortality and both earlier time to transfusion and higher antibody levels provide signatures of efficacy for convalescent plasma in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This information may be informative for the treatment of COVID-19 and design of randomized clinical trials involving convalescent plasma.

This study sought to estimate the basic (R0) and time-dependent (Rt) reproduction number of COVID-19 and contrast the public health measures for ten South American countries. Methods: Data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Country-specific R0 estimates during the first two weeks of the outbreak and Rt estimates after 90 days were estimated. Results: Countries used a combination of isolation, social distancing, quarantine, and community-wide containment measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 at different points in time. R0 ranged from 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.99) in Venezuela, to 3.83 (3.04-4.75) in Chile, whereas Rt, after 90 days, ranged from 0.71 (95% credible interval: 0.39-1.05) in Uruguay to 1.20 (1.19-1.20) in Brazil. Different R0 and Rt values may be related to the testing capacity of each country. Conclusion: R0 in the early phase of the outbreak varied across the South American countries. The adopted public health measures in the initial period of the pandemic appear to have reduced Rt over time in each country.","Valcarcel, B.; Avilez, J. L.; Torres-Roman, J. S.; Poterico, J.

41,Extended SEIQR type model for COVID-19 epidemic and data analysis,"An extended SEIQR type model is considered in order to model the COVID-19 epidemic. It contains the classes of susceptible individuals, exposed, infected symptomatic and asymptomatic, quarantined, hospitalized and recovered. The basic reproduction number and the final size of epidemic are determined. The model is used to fit available data for some European countries. A more detailed model with two different subclasses of susceptible individuals is introduced in order to study the influence of social interaction on the disease progression. The coefficient of social interaction $K$ characterizes the level of social contacts in comparison with complete lockdown (K=0) and the absence of lockdown (K=1). The fitting of data shows that the actual level of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.","Sharma, S.; Volpert, V.; Banerjee, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171439v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,True
42,Impaired cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in severe COVID-19 patients,"The World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak a world-wide pandemic. Individuals infected by the virus exhibited different degrees of symptoms, the basis of which remains largely unclear. Currently, though convalescent individuals have been shown with both cellular and humoral immune responses, there is very limited understanding on the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses, in patients with severe COVID-19. Here, we examined 10 blood samples from COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The majority of them (70%) mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity with production of neutralizing antibodies. However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, accompanied with decreased IFNg expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Most notably, we failed in detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNg production by peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients. Our work thus indicates that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are associated with defective cellular immunity, which not only provides insights on understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but also has implications in developing an effective vaccine to SARS-CoV-2.","Ni, L.; Cheng, M.-L.; Zhao, H.; Feng, Y.; Liu, J.; Ye, F.; Ye, Q.; Zhu, G.; Li, X.; Wang, P.; Shao, J.; Deng, Y.-q.; Wei, P.; Chen, F.; Qin, C.-f.; Wang, G.; Li, F.; Zeng, H.; Dong, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171371v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171371v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,True
43,On the track of the D839Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike fusion peptide: emergence and geotemporal spread of a highly prevalent variant in Portugal,"Mutations in the Spike motif predicted to correspond to the fusion peptide are considered of interest as this domain is a potential target for anti-viral drug development that plays a pivotal role in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into human cell membranes. We tracked the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with the Spike D839Y mutation in the fusion peptide, which was detected early during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We show that this variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February 2020, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal, where represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, until the end of April 2020. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15,5% (1275/8251) and 6,0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively)], we estimate that, between March 14th and April 9th (covering the exponential phase of the epidemic), the relative frequency of Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) at every three days, being potentially associated with one in each four (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%) COVID-19 cases in Portugal during the same period. This observation places the Spike Y839 variant in the origin of the largest SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We hypothesize that population/epidemiological effects (founder effects) and enhanced selective advantage might have concomitantly contributed to the increasing frequency trajectory of the Spike Y839 variant. Screening of the D839Y mutation globally confirmed its detection in 12 additional countries, even though the huge differences in genome sampling between countries hampers any accurate estimate of D839Y global frequency. In summary, our data points out that SARS-CoV-2 Spike Y839 variants, namely the descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant detected in Portugal, need continuous and close surveillance.","Borges, V.; Isidro, J.; Cortes-Martins, H.; Duarte, S.; Vieira, L.; Leite, R.; Gordo, I.; Caetano, C.

44,"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 18,000 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region","Objectives: The objective of this study was to perform a large seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: All healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Participants: A total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main outcome measures: 1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Results: After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively). Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive. Conclusions: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission.

45,Underdetection of COVID-19 cases in France in the exit phase following lockdown,"A novel testing policy was implemented in May in France to systematically screen potential COVID-19 infections and suppress local outbreaks while lifting lockdown restrictions. 20,736 virologically-confirmed cases were reported in mainland France from May 13, 2020 (week 20, end of lockdown) to June 28 (week 26). Accounting for missing data and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation test, this corresponds to 7,258 [95% CI 7,160-7,336] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 69,115 [58,072-77,449] COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-9]% to 31% [28-35]% over time, with regional estimates varying from 11% (Grand Est) to 78% (Normandy) by the end of June. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%) throughout the period. Model projections for the incidence of symptomatic cases (4.5 [3.9-5.0] per 100,000) were compatible with estimates integrating participatory and virological surveillance data, assuming all suspect cases consulted. Encouraging healthcare-seeking behavior and awareness in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. Substantially more aggressive and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed resurgence of cases in France and other European countries.","Pullano, G.; Di Domenico, L.; Sabbatini, C.

46,Hospital length of stay for severe COVID-19: implications for Remdesivir's value,"Remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for treatment of severe COVID-19. Remdesivir's pricing is based on a presumed reduction of hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. But the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) that suggested this treatment benefit excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours. Perhaps as a result, median time to recovery was unusually long in both arms of the study (15 days vs 11 days). Remdesivir requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise be discharged in fewer than 5 days may remain hospitalized to complete treatment while patients who would be discharged between 5 and 8 days, would only have potential reductions in their hospital LOS of 0-3 days. In a retrospective analysis of 1643 adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to Columbia University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April 23, 2020, median hospital LOS was 7 (3-14) days. Five-hundred and eighty-six patients (36%) had a LOS of 1-4 days, 384 (23%) had a LOS of 5-8 days, and 673 (41%) were hospitalized for greater than or equal to 9 days. Remdesivir treatment may not provide the LOS reductions that the company relied on when pricing the therapy: 36% of the cohort would need to have LOS prolonged to receive a 5-day course, and only 41% of patients in our cohort had LOS of 9 days or more, meaning they could have their LOS shortened by 4 days and still receive a full Remdesivir course. Further investigation of shorter treatment courses and programs to facilitate outpatient intravenous Remdesivir administration are needed.","Anderson, M.; Bach, P.; Baldwin, M.

48,Cryo-EM Structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Endoribonuclease Nsp15,"New therapeutics are urgently needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the on-going Covid-19 pandemic. Nsp15, a uridine-specific endoribonuclease found in all coronaviruses, processes viral RNA to evade detection by RNA-activated host defense systems, making it a promising drug target. Previous work with SARS-CoV-1 established that Nsp15 is active as a hexamer, yet how Nsp15 recognizes and processes viral RNA remains unknown. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. The UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction at 3.36 [A] resolution provides molecular details into how critical residues within the Nsp15 active site recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond, whereas the apo-states reveal active site conformational heterogeneity. We further demonstrate the specificity and mechanism of nuclease activity by analyzing Nsp15 products using mass spectrometry. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.","Pillon, M. C.; Frazier, M.

However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Y.; Yan, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
52,Clustering of age standardised COVID-19 infection fatality ratios and death trajectories,"Background An accurate measure of the impact of COVID-19 is the infection fatality ratio, or the proportion of deaths among those infected, which does not depend on variable testing rates between nations. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 depends strongly on age and current estimates of the infection fatality ratio do not account for differences in national age profiles. Comparisons of cumulative death trajectories allow the effect and timing of public health interventions to be assessed. Our purpose is to (1) determine whether countries are clustered according to infection fatality ratios and (2) compare interventions to slow the spread of the disease by clustering death trajectories. Methods National age standardised infection fatality ratios were derived from age stratified estimates from China and population estimates from the World Health Organisation. The IFRs were clustered into groups using Gaussian mixture models. Trajectory analysis clustered cumulative death rates in two time windows, 50 and 100 days after the first reported death. Findings Infection fatality ratios from 201 nations were clustered into three groups: young, medium and older, with corresponding means (SD) of 0.20% (0.03%), 0.38% (0.11%) and 0.93% (0.21%). At 50 and 100 days after the first reported death, there were two clusters of cumulative death trajectories from 113 nations with at least 25 deaths reported at 100 days. The first group had slowly increasing or stable cumulative death rates, while the second group had accelerating rates at the end of the time window. Fifty-two nations changed group membership between the time windows. Conclusion A cluster of younger nations have a lower estimated infection fatality ratio than older nations. The effect and timing of public health interventions in preventing the spread of the disease can be tracked by clustering death rate trajectories into stable or accelerating and comparing changes over time.","Kelly, T.-L.; Humphrey, G.; Miller, C.; Bowden, J.

In this article, we used the classical SEIR model and a generalized SEIR model called SEIRDP model inspired in a model previously used during the outbreak in China to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in Algeria for a future period of 100 days using official reported data from early April to early August, 2020. Initial evaluation showed that the two models had a net correspondence with the reported data during this period for cumulative infected cases but the number of cumulative deaths was underestimated with the classical SEIR model. Model prediction with the SEIRDP concluded that the number of cumulative infected cases will increase in the next days reaching a number of about 60 k in middle November with a median of about 300 daily cases. Also, the number of estimated deaths will be around 2k.

54,Janus Kinase-Inhibitor and Type I Interferon Ability to Produce Favorable Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 17 million. Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and by their ability to promote viral clearance in past coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate role of these therapies in COVID-19 patients. Methods MEDLINE and MedRxiv were searched until July 30th, 2020, including studies that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clear risk estimates or those that permitted back-calculation. Results We searched 733 studies, ultimately including four randomized and eleven non-randomized clinical trials. JAK-inhibitor recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.03-0.39, p=0.0005) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95%CI, 0.01-0.26, p=0.0005), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95%CI, 10.68-48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.85, p=0.03), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). Conclusions JAK-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the efficacy of JAK-inhibitors and Type I interferons and clinical outcomes in COVID-19.","Walz, L.; Cohen, A.

For two months, Australians were asked to remain at home and only leave for essential activities. We investigate the impact this had on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Methods: Australians aged 18+ were eligible to participate in an online survey from 23 April-11 May 2020. Questions included contraceptive use, pregnancy intentions and access to SRH services. We report on the experiences of 518 female participants aged <50 years. Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use were analysed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate difficulty accessing SRH products and services. Qualitative data were analysed using descriptive thematic analysis. Results: Most participants (55.4%, 287/518) were aged 18-24 years. Most (76.1%, 379/498) indicated they were trying to avoid pregnancy. The oral contraceptive pill was the most common single method used (20.8%; 107/514). Nearly 20% (101/514) reported they were not using contraception. Older women (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.9 for 25-34 vs 18-24 years) and those employed (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7) had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. Women aged 25-34 (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7) or 35-49 years (OR=0.3; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.6) were less likely to experience difficulty accessing feminine hygiene products.

56,"The effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review","Objectives: We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? Design: systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework. Main outcome measures: measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations, or using different sampling methods. Results: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% confidence interval 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. For antibody tests, ten studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management. Conclusions: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.","Jarrom, D.; Elston, L.; Washington, J.; Prettyjohns, M.; Cann, K.; Myles, S.; Groves, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171777v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171777v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,True
57,A diagnostic decision-making protocol combines a new-generation of serological assay and PCR to fully resolve ambiguity in COVID-19 diagnosis,"The capacity to accurately diagnosis COVID-19 is essential for effective public health measures to manage the ongoing global pandemic, yet no presently available diagnostic technologies or clinical protocols can achieve full positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) performance. Two factors prevent accurate diagnosis: the failure of sampling methods (e.g., 40% false negatives from PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs) and sampling-time-dependent failures reflecting individual humoral responses of patients (e.g., serological testing outside of the sero-positive stage). Here, we report development of a diagnostic protocol that achieves full PPV and NPV based on a cohort of 500 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and present several discoveries about the sero-conversion dynamics throughout the disease course of COVID-19. The fundamental enabling technology for our study and diagnostic protocol-termed SANE, for Symptom (dpo)-Antibody-Nucleic acid-Epidemiological history-is our development of a peptide-protein hybrid microarray (PPHM) for COVID-19. The peptides comprising PPHMCOVID-19 were selected based on clinical sample data, and give our technology the unique capacity to monitor a patient's humoral response throughout the disease course. Among other assay-development related and clinically relevant findings, our use of PPHMCOVID-19 revealed that 5% of COVID-19 patients are from an ""early sero-reversion"" subpopulation, thus explaining many of the mis-diagnoses we found in our comparative testing using PCR, CLIA, and PPHMCOVID-19. Accordingly, the full SANE protocol incorporates orthogonal technologies to account for these patient variations, and successfully overcomes both the sampling method and sampling time limitations that have previously prevented doctors from achieving unambiguous, accurate diagnosis of COVID-19","Cheng, H.; Chen, H.; Li, Y.; Zheng, P.; Gu, D.; He, S.; Ma, D.; Wang, R.; Han, J.; Lu, Z.; Xia, X.; Deng, Y.; Yang, L.; Xu, W.; Wu, S.; Liang, C.; Wang, H.; Sun, B.; Zhong, N.; Ma, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172452v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172452v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,True
58,Coordinated support for local action: A modeling study of strategies to facilitate behavior adoption in urban poor communities of Liberia for sustained COVID-19 suppression,"Background: Long-term suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will require context-specific strategies that recognize the heterogeneous capacity of communities to undertake public health recommendations, particularly due to limited access to food, sanitation facilities, and physical space required for self-quarantine or isolation. We highlight the epidemiological impact of barriers to adoption of public health recommendations by urban slum populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and the potential role of community-based initiatives to coordinate efforts that support cases and high-risk contacts. Methods: Daily case updates published by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia were used to inform a stratified stochastic compartmental model representing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in two subpopulations (urban poor versus less socioeconomically vulnerable) of Montserrado County, Liberia. Differential transmission was considered at levels of the subpopulation, household versus community, and events (i.e., funerals). Adoption of home-isolation behavior was assumed to be related to the proportion of each subpopulation residing in housing units with multiple rooms, access to sanitation facilities, and access to basic goods like water and food. Percentage reductions in cumulative infection counts, cumulative counts of severe cases, and maximum daily infection counts for each subpopulation were evaluated across intervention scenarios that included symptom-triggered, community-driven efforts to support high-risk contacts and confirmed cases in self-isolation following the scheduled lifting of the state of emergency. Results: Modeled outbreaks for the status quo scenario differed between the two subpopulations, with increased overall infection burden but decreased numbers of severe cases in the urban poor subpopulation relative to the less socioeconomically vulnerable population after 180 days post-introduction into Liberia. With more proactive self-isolation by mildly symptomatic individuals after lifting of the public health emergency, median reductions in cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence were 7.6% (IQR: 2.2%-20.9%), 7.0% (2.0%-18.5%), and 9.9% (2.5%-31.4%) for cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence, respectively, across epidemiological curve simulations in the urban poor subpopulation and 16.8% (5.5%-29.3%), 15.0% (5.0%-26.4%), and 28.1% (IQR: 9.3%-47.8%) in the less socioeconomically vulnerable population. An increase in the maximum attainable percentage of behavior adoption by the urban slum subpopulation, with the provision of support to facilitate self-isolation or quarantine, was associated with median reductions in cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence were 19.2% (IQR: 10.1%-34.0%), 21.1% (IQR: 13.3%-34.2%), and 26.0% (IQR: 11.5%-48.9%), respectively, relative to the status quo scenario. Conclusions: Broadly supported post-lockdown recommendations that prioritize proactively monitoring symptoms, seeking testing and isolating at home by confirmed cases are limited by resource constraints in urban poor communities. Investing in community-based initiatives that determine needs and coordinate needs-based support for self-identified cases and their contacts could provide a more effective, longer-term strategy for suppressing transmission of COVID-19 in settings with prevalent distrust and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.","Skrip, L.; Fallah, M.

59,A Large-Scale Clinical Validation Study Using nCapp Cloud Plus Terminal by Frontline Doctors for the Rapid Diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in China,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic acute infectious disease, especially with the features of possible asymptomatic carriers and high contagiousness. It causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and results in a high mortality rate if pneumonia is involved. Currently, it is difficult to quickly identify asymptomatic cases or COVID-19 patients with pneumonia due to limited access to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid tests and CT scans, which facilitates the spread of the disease at the community level, and contributes to the overwhelming of medical resources in intensive care units. Goal This study aimed to develop a scientific and rigorous clinical diagnostic tool for the rapid prediction of COVID-19 cases based on a COVID-19 clinical case database in China, and to assist global frontline doctors to efficiently and precisely diagnose asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and cases who had a false-negative RT-PCR test result. Methods With online consent, and the approval of the ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital Fudan Unversity (approval number B2020-032R) to ensure that patient privacy is protected, clinical information has been uploaded in real-time through the New Coronavirus Intelligent Auto-diagnostic Assistant Application of cloud plus terminal (nCapp) by doctors from different cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Harbin, Dalian, Wuxi, Qingdao, Rizhao, and Bengbu) during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. By quality control and data anonymization on the platform, a total of 3,249 cases from COVID-19 high-risk groups were collected. These patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and chest CT scans, both of which were used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia. In particular, the dataset included 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, and 122 asymptomatic cases who had positive RT-PCR test results, amongst whom 31 cases were diagnosed. We also integrated the function of a survey in nCapp to collect user feedback from frontline doctors. Findings We applied the statistical method of a multi-factor regression model to the training dataset (1,624 cases) and developed a prediction model for COVID-19 with 9 clinical indicators that are fast and accessible: 'Residing or visiting history in epidemic regions', 'Exposure history to COVID-19 patient', 'Dry cough', 'Fatigue', 'Breathlessness', 'No body temperature decrease after antibiotic treatment', 'Fingertip blood oxygen saturation<=93%', 'Lymphopenia', and 'C-reactive protein (CRP) increased'. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the model was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.89) in the training dataset and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.86) in the validation dataset (1,625 cases). To ensure the sensitivity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.09. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 98.0% (95% CI: 96.9%, 99.1%) and 17.3% (95% CI: 15.0%, 19.6%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 96.5% (95% CI: 95.1%, 98.0%) and 18.8% (95% CI: 16.4%, 21.2%), respectively, in the validation dataset. In the subset of the 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 132 cases, accounting for 96.4% (95% CI: 91.7%, 98.8%) of the cases. In the subset of the 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 59 cases, accounting for 95.2% (95% CI: 86.5%, 99.0%) of the cases. Considering the specificity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.32. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 83.5% (95% CI: 80.5%, 86.4%) and 83.2% (95% CI: 80.9%, 85.5%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 79.6% (95% CI: 76.4%, 82.8%) and 81.3% (95% CI: 78.9%, 83.7%), respectively, in the validation dataset, which is very close to the published AI model. The results of the online survey 'Questionnaire Star' showed that 90.9% of nCapp users in WeChat mini programs were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the tool. The WeChat mini program received a significantly higher satisfaction rate than other platforms, especially for 'availability and sharing convenience of the App' and 'fast speed of log-in and data entry'. Discussion With the assistance of nCapp, a mobile-based diagnostic tool developed from a large database that we collected from COVID-19 high-risk groups in China, frontline doctors can rapidly identify asymptomatic patients and avoid misdiagnoses of cases with false-negative RT-PCR results. These patients require timely isolation or close medical supervision. By applying the model, medical resources can be allocated more reasonably, and missed diagnoses can be reduced. In addition, further education and interaction among medical professionals can improve the diagnostic efficiency for COVID-19, thus avoiding the transmission of the disease from asymptomatic patients at the community level.","Yang, D.; Xu, T.; Wang, X.; Chen, D.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, L.; Liu, J.; Xiao, K.; Bai, L.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, L.; Tong, L.; Wu, C.; Wang, Y.; Dong, C.; Ye, M.; Xu, Y.; Song, Z.; Chen, H.; Li, J.; Wang, J.; Tan, F.; Yu, H.; Zhou, J.; Yu, J.; Du, C.; Zhao, H.; Shang, Y.; Huang, L.; Zhao, J.; Jin, Y.; Powell, C.

60,Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Using Electrochemical Impedance-Based Detector,"Emerging novel human contagious viruses and pathogens put humans at risk of hospitalization and possibly death due to the unavailability of vaccines and drugs which may take years to develop. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has caused over 550,000 deaths worldwide as of July 2020. Accurate and scalable point-of-care devices would increase screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Here, we demonstrate rapid label-free electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a commercially available impedance sensing platform. A 16-well plate containing sensing electrodes was pre-coated with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and subsequently tested with samples of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody CR3022 (0.1 g/ml, 1.0 g/ml, 10 g/ml). Subsequent blinded testing was performed on six serum specimens taken from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (1:100 dilution factor). The platform was able to differentiate spikes in impedance measurements from a negative control (1% milk solution) for all CR3022 samples. Further, successful differentiation and detection of all positive clinical samples from negative control was achieved. Measured impedance values were consistent when compared to standard ELISA test results showing a strong correlation between them (R2 = 0:9). Detection occurs in less than five minutes and the well-based platform provides a simplified and familiar testing interface that can be readily adaptable for use in clinical settings.","Rashed, M.

61,Effectiveness of booster BCG vaccination in preventing Covid-19 infection,"Introduction : The evidence that BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine may increase the ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens other than tuberculosis has been studied in the past. This nonspecific immunity gained our interest, especially after initial reports of less cases in countries with universal BCG vaccination. In hopes of possible protective immunity, all staff of the Emirates International Hospital (United Arab Emirates) were offered a booster BCG vaccine in early March 2020. All the hospital staff were then tested for Covid-19 infection by the end of June 2020. Methodology : We divided the subjects into two groups: booster vaccinated, versus unvaccinated. The rate of Covid-19 infection was compared between the groups. Criteria included all staff who were offered the vaccine. Results: 71 subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive COVID 19 infection. 209 subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positive PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group. (Fishers exact test p-value=0.004). Conclusion : Our findings demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the booster BCG vaccine, specifically the booster in preventing Covid-19 infections in an elevated-risk healthcare population.","Amirlak, I.; Haddad, R.; Hardy, J.

62,The Diagnostic Accuracy of Subjective Dyspnea in Detecting Hypoxemia Among Outpatients with COVID-19,"Objectives: The majority of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 can be managed using virtual care. Dyspnea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnea measures in capturing hypoxemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnea in diagnosing hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 3, 2020 to June 8, 2020. Hypoxemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%. Dyspnea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV), and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/-LR) for detecting hypoxemia. Results: During the study period 64/298 (21.5%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 14/64 (21.9%) were diagnosed with hypoxemia. The presence/absence of dyspnea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxemia, with SN 57% (95% CI 30-81%), SP 78% (63%-88%), NPV 86% (72%-94%), PPV 42% (21%-66%), +LR 2.55 (1.3-5.1), -LR 0.55 (0.3-1.0). An mMRC dyspnea score >1 (SP 97%, 95%CI 82%-100%), Roth Maximal Count <12 (SP 100%, 95%CI 75-100%), and Roth Counting time < 8 seconds (SP 93%, 95%CI 66%-100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxemia, but displayed low SN ([&le;]50%). Conclusions: Subjective dyspnea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19. Safe home management of patients with COVID-19 should incorporate home oxygenation saturation monitoring.","Berezin, L.; Zhabokritsky, A.; Andany, N.; Chan, A. K.; Gershon, A.; Lam, P. W.; Leis, J.

63,High throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq next generation sequencing,"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Bhoyar, R.

64,Petabase-scale sequence alignment catalyses viral discovery,"Public sequence data represents a major opportunity for viral discovery, but its exploration has been inhibited by a lack of efficient methods for searching this corpus, which is currently at the petabase scale and growing exponentially. To address the ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and expand the known sequence diversity of viruses, we aligned pangenomes for coronaviruses (CoV) and other viral families to 5.6 petabases of public sequencing data from 3.8 million biologically diverse samples. To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, Serratus, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of CoV and CoV-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community. Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of CoV and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.","Edgar, R.

65,Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals That Some Mutations May Affect On Both Spike Structure Damage and Ligand Binding Site,"There are some mutations are known related to SARS-CoV-2. Together with these mutations known, we tried to show other newly mutations regionally. According to our results which 4326 whole sequences are used, we found that some mutations occur only in a certain region, while some other mutations are found in each regions. Especially in Asia, more than one mutation(three different mutations are found in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) was seen in the same sequence. Although we detected a huge number of mutations (we found more than seventy in Asia) by regions, some of them were predicted that damage spikes protein structure by using bioinformatic tools. The predicted results are G75V(isolated from North America), T95I(isolated from South Korea), G143V(isolated from North America), M177I(isolated Asia), L293M(isolated from Asia), P295H(isolated from Asia), T393P(isolated from Europe),P507S(isolated from Asia), D614G(isolated from all regions) respectively. Also, in this study, we tried to show how possible binding sites of ligands change if the spike protein structure is damaged and whether more than one mutation affects ligand binding was estimated using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly, mutations that predicted to damage the structure do not affect ligand binding sites, whereas ligands binding sites were affected in those with multiple mutations.

66,SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies Mediate Rapid Virus Evolution and Adaptation,"The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting global healthcare emergency warrants a better understanding of its biology. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 evolution to create novel dangerous variants remains underexplored. Thus, we passaged SARS-CoV-2 in defined conditions and determined its genomic adaptation dynamics. We demonstrate the presence of remarkably stable SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. We further show that the quasispecies nature of the virus population ensured rapid adaptation of the spike PRRARS motif upon passaging in Vero cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2 expressing cells led to a reverse mutation at the same site. We observed the emergence of novel mutations in envelope protein upon virus culture in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. Finally, we show that the heparan sulfate-binding motif (PRRARS) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein acted as a determinant of negative growth selection.

67,"Comparative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 binding (IgG, IgM, IgA) and neutralizing antibodies from human serum samples","A newly identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","Mazzini, L.; Martinuzzi, D.; Hyseni, I.; Lapini, G.; Benincasa, L.; Piu, P.; Trombetta, C.

68,A potent neutralizing nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 with inhaled delivery potential,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. The unprecedented scale and severity call for rapid development of effective prophylactics or therapeutics. We here reported Nanobody (Nb) phage display libraries derived from four camels immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), from which 381 Nbs were identified to recognize SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Furthermore, seven Nbs were shown to block interaction of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-variants, bat-SL-CoV-WIV1-RBD and SARS-CoV-1-RBD. Among the seven candidates, Nb11-59 exhibited the highest activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 with ND50 of 0.55 g/mL. Nb11-59 can be produced on a large-scale in Pichia pastoris, with 20 g/L titer and 99.36% purity. It also showed good stability profile, and nebulization did not impact its stability. Overall, Nb11-59 might be a promising prophylactic and therapeutic molecule against COVID-19, especially through inhalation delivery.

69,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 deletion variants detected in a nosocomial cluster during routine genomic surveillance, Lyon, France","Through routine genomic surveillance of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (n=229 whole genome sequences), 2 different frameshifting deletions were newly detected in the open reading frame (ORF) 6, starting at the same position (27267). While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.

ImportanceWhile the SARS-CoV-2 genome has remained relatively stable since its emergence in the human population, genomic deletions are an evolutionary pattern previously described for the related SARS-CoV. Real-time genomic monitoring of the circulating variants is paramount to detect strain prevalence and transmission dynamics. Given the role of ORF6 in interferon modulation, further characterization, such as mechanistic interactions and interferon monitoring in patients, is crucial in understanding the viral-host factors driving disease evolution.","Queromes, G.; Destras, G.; Bal, A.; Regue, H.; Burfin, G.; Brun, S.; Fanget, R.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Frobert, E.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
70,K18-hACE2 Mice for Studies of COVID-19 Treatments and Pathogenesis Including Anosmia,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","Perlman, S.; Zheng, J.; WONG, L.

If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the functional virus proteins cannot form and the virus cannot replicate and assemble. Any compound that inhibits the 3CLpro is therefore a potential drug to end the pandemic. Here we show that the diffraction power of 3CLpro crystals is effectively destroyed by Ebselen. It appears that Ebselen may be a widely available, relatively cost effective way to eliminate the SARS coronavirus 2.","Malla, T.

72,Sofosbuvir Terminated RNA is More Resistant to SARS-CoV-2 Proofreader than RNA Terminated by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jockusch, S.; Tao, C.; Li, X.; Chien, M.; Kumar, S.; Morozova, I.; Kalachikov, S.; Russo, J.

73,DC/L-SIGN recognition of spike glycoprotein promotes SARS-CoV-2 trans-infection and can be inhibited by a glycomimetic antagonist,"The efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a pandemic that is unique in modern history. Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection.

74,Bi-paratopic and multivalent human VH domains neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting distinct epitopes within the ACE2 binding interface of Spike,"Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","Bracken, C.

75,An ultra-high affinity synthetic nanobody blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection by locking Spike into an inactive conformation,"Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","Schoof, M.; Faust, B.; Saunders, R.

We compared these results with functional neutralization activity using a fluorescent reporter strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a microwell assay. This revealed positive correlations of varying strength (Spearman r = 0.37-0.52) between binding and neutralization. Donors age 48-75 had the highest neutralization activity.

77,Nonstructural protein 1 of SARS-CoV-2 is a potent pathogenicity factor redirecting host protein synthesis machinery toward viral RNA.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic since the infection was first reported in China in December 2019. The aim of this study was to establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and to examine their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent, effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening of novel antiviral drug candidates.

In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from donors with different physiological and pathological backgrounds such as smoking, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, or viral infections. By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

81,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, neuropathogenesis and transmission among deer mice: Implications for reverse zoonosis to New World rodents","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in November, 2019 in China and rapidly became pandemic. As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.","Fagre, A.; Lewis, J.; Eckley, M.; Zhan, S.; Rocha, S.

The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","Hassert, M.; Geerling, E.; Stone, E.

84,Signatures and mechanisms of efficacious therapeutic ribonucleotides against SARS-CoV-2 revealed by analysis of its replicase using magnetic tweezers,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from an infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the third coronavirus outbreak to plague humanity this century. Currently, the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the Remdesivir (RDV), an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here, we have applied a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV, a Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106), and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state, the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC, T-1106 accesses LFC as a non-cognate nucleotide, while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous reports, we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase, only appearing as termination events when traditional, gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection, inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Use of this experimental paradigm will be essential to the development of therapeutic nucleotide analogs targeting polymerases.","Seifert, M.; Bera, S. C.; van Nies, P.; Kirchdoerfer, R.

85,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult,"Numerous studies covering some aspects of SARS-CoV-2 data analyses are being published on a daily basis, including a regularly updated phylogeny on nextstrain.org. Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising all virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be possible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes based on statistical criteria is also not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","Morel, B.; Barbera, P.; Czech, L.; Bettisworth, B.; Huebner, L.; Lutteropp, S.; Serdari, D.; Kostaki, E.-G.; Mamais, I.; Kozlov, A.; Pavlidis, P.

86,Predicted Cellular Immunity Population Coverage Gaps for SARS-CoV-2 Subunit Vaccines and their Augmentation by Compact Joint Sets,"Subunit vaccines induce immunity to a pathogen by presenting a component of the pathogen and thus inherently limit the representation of pathogen peptides for cellular immunity based memory. We find that SARS-CoV-2 subunit peptides may not be robustly displayed by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules in certain individuals. We introduce an augmentation strategy for subunit vaccines that adds a small number of peptides to a vaccine to improve the population coverage of pathogen peptide display. We augment a subunit vaccine by selecting additional pathogen peptides to maximize the total number of vaccine peptide hits against the distribution of MHC haplotypes in a population. For each subunit we design independent MHC class I and MHC class II peptide sets for augmentation, and alternatively design a combined set of peptides for MHC class I and class II display. We evaluate the population coverage of 9 different subunits of SARS-CoV-2, including 5 functional domains and 4 full proteins, and augment each of them to fill a predicted coverage gap. We predict that a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain subunit vaccine will have fewer than six peptide-HLA hits with [&le;] 50 nM binding affinity per individual in 51.31% (class I) and 32.99% (class II) of the population, and with augmentation, the uncovered population is predicted to be reduced to 0.54% (class I) and 1.46% (class II). We find that a joint set of pathogen peptides for MHC class I and class II display is predicted to produce a more compact vaccine design than using independent sets for MHC class I and class II. We provide an open source implementation of our design methods (OptiVax), vaccine evaluation tool (EvalVax), as well as the data used in our design efforts here: https://github.com/gifford-lab/optivax/tree/master/augmentation.","Liu, G.; Carter, B.; Gifford, D.

87,IFN signaling and neutrophil degranulation transcriptional signatures are induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity. Together, our transcriptomic studies have delineated disease pathways to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to facilitate the design of new therapeutics for COVID-19.","Rosa, B.

Here, we performed cryo-EM and site-specific glycan analysis of one of the leading subunit vaccine candidates from Novavax based on a full-length spike protein formulated in polysorbate 80 (PS 80) detergent. Our studies reveal a stable prefusion conformation of the spike immunogen with slight differences in the S1 subunit compared to published spike ectodomain structures.

89,Structure of papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2 and its complexes with non-covalent inhibitors,"The number of new cases world-wide for the COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, while efforts to contain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is producing varied results in different countries. There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60-2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro, with the ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value for SARS-CoV-2.","Osipiuk, J.; Azizi, S.-A.; Dvorkin, S.; Endres, M.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Jones, K.

90,Peptide Antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),"The design of an immunogenic scaffold that serves a role in treating a pathogen, and can be rapidly and predictively modeled, has remained an elusive feat. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK is designed to ""uncloak"" the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.","Watson, A.; Ferreira, L.

91,Computational Hot-Spot Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain / ACE2 Complex,"Infection and replication of SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) requires entry to the interior of host cells. In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted  hot-spot residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and the CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI and SARS CoV-2 / ACE2 PPI. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.","Rosario, P.

92,Alveolitis in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is driven by self-sustaining circuits between infected alveolar macrophages and T cells,"Some patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.

We explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency mutations ([&ge;] 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M. S.; Islam, M. R.; Ul Alam, A. S.

94,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant genomes,"Viral recombination has the potential to bring about viral genotypes with modified phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among Betacoronaviruses is well documented, SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in humans for approximately 8 months and thus has had a relatively short window of opportunity for the occurrence of recombination. The ability to detect recombination has further been limited by the relatively low levels of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, two studies have reported recombinants among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we first revisit these findings with a new analysis approach, arguing that neither presents a clear case of within-SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Applying this same approach to available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we then identify five recombinant genomes. Each of these genomes contain phylogenetic markers of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 clades. Further, the predicted parent clades of these recombinant genomes were, with one exception, documented to be co-circulating in the country of infection in the two weeks prior to the sample being collected. Our results indicate that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 strains is occurring, but is either not widespread or often remains undetectable given current levels of viral genetic diversity. Efforts to monitor the emergence of new recombinant genomes should therefore be sustained.","VanInsberghe, D.; Neish, A. S.; Lowen, A.

FindingsTotal publications in the observation period for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG were 23000, 5898 and 5393 respectively. The average number of publications/day for PubMed, Elsevier and RG were 70.0 {+/-}128.6, 77.6{+/-}125.3 and 255.6{+/-}205.8 respectively. PubMed shows an avalanche in the number of publication around May 10, number of publications jumped from 6.0{+/-}8.4/day to 282.5{+/-}110.3/day. The average doubling time for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 10.3{+/-}4 days, 20.6 days, and 2.3{+/-}2.0 days respectively. In PubMed average articles/journal was 5.2{+/-}10.3 and top 20 authors representing 935 articles are of Chinese descent. The average number of publications per author for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 1.2{+/-}1.4, 1.3{+/-}0.9, and 1.1{+/-}0.4 respectively. Subgroup analysis, PubMed review articles mean and median review time for each article were <0|17{+/-}17|77> and 13.9 days respectively; and reducing at a rate of-0.21 days (count)/day.

InterpretationAlthough the disease has been known for around 6 months, the number of publications related to the Covid-19 until now is huge and growing very fast with time. It is essential to rationalize the publications scientifically by the researchers, authors, reviewers, and publishing houses.

98,IFN-γ and TNF-α drive a CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophage phenotype expanded in severe COVID-19 and other diseases with tissue inflammation,"Immunosuppressive and anti-cytokine treatment may have a protective effect for patients with COVID-19. Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, F.; Mears, J.

99,Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India on molecular diagnostic assays,"An isolated epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) originating in Wuhan, China has now rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.","Jain, A.; Rophina, M.; Mahajan, S.; Krishnan, B.
