0,Effect of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System inhibitors on outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension: Systematic review and Meta-analysis,"Objective: This research aimed to systematically review and summarize the influence of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors on the outcome of COVID_19 patients with hypertension. Methods: Electronic databases; PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, clinical trial.gov, and Google Scholar were searched from 2019 to June 1, 2020. Additionally, the references of identified articles were also searched. Results: A total of 9 articles comprising 3,823 patients were incorporated; 1416 patients on RAAS inhibitors and 3469 on non-RAAS inhibitors. The study demonstrated that the taking of RAAS inhibitors in COVID_19 patients with hypertension significantly reduced mortality where patients on RAAS inhibitors had a 27% decrease of mortality (RR= 0.73 [95% CI: 0.63- 0.85, p<0.0001, I2=0%, random-effects model]) compared to those not taking ACEI/ARB. No significant association were observed in disease severity (RR= 0.92 (95% CI: 0.74- 1.14) and hospitalization (WMD= -2.33[95% CI: -5.60, 0.75]), random-effects model. Conclusion: This study supports RAAS inhibitors safe use among COVID_19 patients with hypertension. Keywords: COVID_19, ACEI, ARB, Hypertension, Coronavirus","Beressa, T.

1,Clinical Performance Evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test for Determining Past Exposure to SARS-CoV-2,"The true prevalence and population seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown, due to the number of asymptomatic infections and limited access to high-performance antibody tests. To control the COVID-19 pandemic it is crucial to understand the true seroprevalence, but not every region has access to extensive centralized PCR and serology testing. Currently available rapid antibody tests lack the accuracy needed for recommendation by health authorities. To fill this gap, we analyzed and validated the clinical performance of a new point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Assay, a chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative detection of IgM/IgG antibodies for use in near-patient settings. Analysis was performed using 42 Anti-SARS-Cov-2 positive (CoV+) and 92 Anti-SARS-Covid-2 negative (CoV-) leftover samples from before December 2019, using the Elecsys(R) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 as the reference assay. Analytical specificity was tested using leftover samples from individuals with symptoms of common cold collected before December 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test was 100.0% (95% CI 91.59-100.00) sensitive and 96.74% (95% CI 90.77-99.32) specific with an assay failure rate of 0.00%. No cross-reactivity was observed against the common cold panel. Method comparison was additionally conducted by two external laboratories, using 100 CoV+/275 CoV- samples, also comparing whole blood versus plasma matrix. The comparison demonstrated for plasma 96.00% positive/96.36% negative percent agreement with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and overall 99.20% percent agreement between whole blood and EDTA plasma. The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test demonstrated similar clinical performance to the manufacturer's data and to a centralized automated immunoassay, with no cross-reactivity to common cold panels.","Findeisen, P.; Stiegler, H.; Lopez-Calle, E.; Schneider, T.; Urlaub, E.; Hayer, J.; Zemmrich, C.

2,"Multiplexed, Microscale, Microarray-based Serological Assay for Antibodies Against All Human-Relevant Coronaviruses","Rapid, sensitive, and precise multiplexed assays for serological analysis during candidate COVID-19 vaccine development would streamline clinical trials. The VaxArray Coronavirus (CoV) SeroAssay quantifies IgG antibody binding to 9 pandemic, potentially pandemic, and endemic human CoV spike antigens in 2 hours with automated results analysis. IgG antibodies in serum bind to the CoV spike protein capture antigens printed in a microarray format and are labeled with a fluorescent anti-species IgG secondary label. The assay demonstrated excellent lower limits of quantification ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 ng/mL and linear dynamic ranges of 76 to 911-fold. Average precision of 11% CV and accuracy (% recovery) of 92.5% over all capture antigens were achieved over 216 replicates representing 3 days and 3 microarray lots. Clinical performance on 263 human serum samples (132 SARS-CoV-2 negatives and 131 positives based on donor-matched RT-PCR and/or date of collection) produced 98.5% PPA (sensitivity) and 100% NPA (specificity).","Dawson, E.

3,Evaluation of attitude among infertile couples about continuing assisted reproductive technologies therapy during novel coronavirus outbreak,"Study question: Does the fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic reduce the desire of infertile couples to continue treatment? Summary answer: Most of the participants in this study wanted to continue treatment. What is known already: The effect of the prevalence of infectious diseases including the Zika virus on the attitude of infertile couples has been studied in very few studies. However, the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the attitude of infertile couples has not been investigated. Study design, size, duration: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study on forty-six infertile couples (n=92) who referred to our infertility clinic from 4 March 2020 through 20 June 2020. Participants/materials, settings, methods: This study is based on potential infertile couples for treatment with assisted reproductive technology (ART) who referred to our infertility clinic, Sari, Iran (median age of 35.5 years). All individuals with primary infertility, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and candidates for ART, were included in the study. People who did not agree to participate in the study were excluded. Subjects were surveyed using a researcher-made questionnaire. This questionnaire has four sections as follows: The first part included demographic information and clinical characteristics, the second part included medical records, the third part included questions related to assessing the level of awareness regarding coronavirus infection, and the fourth part included questions related to the attitude towards continuing infertility treatment. The validity of this questionnaire was assessed by three infertility specialists and was confirmed with Cronbachs alpha of 0.78. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Main results and the role of chance: There is no significant relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and the level of awareness (P-value <0.05). Thirty-two patients (33.33%) had decreased motivation to continue treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of transmission to the fetus (28.13%) had the highest frequency among the causes of decreased motivation to continue treatment (P-value = 0.011). Confidence in support of the treatment team (56.67%) was the most common reason for lack of motivation in people without decreased motivation (P-value <0.001). The majority of patients had a very high or high tendency (65.22%) to continue or start treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic (P-value <0.001). Most people had an average fear of getting the disease (39.13%) (value <0.001). Examining the relationship between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and attitude level variables showed that there is only a significant relationship between the greater desire to have a child and the continuation or initiation of treatment with the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (P-value = 0.032). Limitations, reasons for caution: We were not able to fully assess patients' deep feelings and cultural beliefs, due to the use of questionnaires and the lack of interviews. Wider implications of the findings: Our results showed for the first time that patients' knowledge about COVID-19 and trust in the treatment staff played an effective role in selecting and continuing infertility treatment. To clarify this issue, studies with the larger statistical community in the form of interviews are needed. Study funding/completing interest(s): The study received financial support from the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences (Grant number: 7903). None of the funders had any role in the study design, collection, analysis, or interpretation of data, writing of the paper, or publication decisions. The authors have nothing to declare.

4,Exploring the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education: an international cross-sectional study of medical learners,"To broadly explore the extent that COVID-19 has initially impacted medical learners around the world and examine global trends and patterns across geographic regions and levels of training, a cross-sectional survey of medical learners was conducted between March 25-June 14th, 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared concurrent COVID-19 a pandemic. 6492 medical learners completed the survey from 140 countries, Students were concerned about the quality of their learning, training progression, and milestone fulfillment. Most trainees felt under-utilized and wanted to be engaged clinically in meaningful ways; however, some trainees felt that contributing to healthcare during a pandemic was beyond the scope of a medical learner. Statistically significant differences were detected between levels of training and geographic regions for satisfaction with organizational responses, the impact of COVID-19 on wellness, and state-trait anxiety. Overall, the initial disruption to medical training has been perceived by learners across all levels and geographic regions to have negatively affected their training and well-being, particularly amongst postgraduate trainees. These results provide initial insights into the areas that warrant future research as well as consideration for current and future policy planning, such as the policies for clinical utilization of medical learners during public health emergencies.","Brown, A.; Kassam, A.; Paget, M.; Blades, K.; Mercia, M.; Kachra, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186304v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186304v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
5,SARS-CoV-2 Protein in Wastewater Mirrors COVID-19 Prevalence.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to diverse approaches to track infections. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 is a fecally-shed RNA virus, and many groups have assayed wastewater for viral RNA fragments by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) as a proxy of COVID-19 prevalence in the community. Most groups report low levels of viral RNA that often skirt the methods theoretical limits of detection and quantitation. Here, we demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in wastewater using traditional immunoblotting and quantitate them from wastewater solids using an immuno-linked PCR method called Multiplex Paired-antibody Amplified Detection (MPAD). In this longitudinal study, we corrected for stochastic variability inherent to wastewater-based epidemiology using multiple fecal content protein biomarkers. These normalized SARS-CoV-2 protein data correlated well with public health metrics. Our method of assaying SARS-CoV-2 protein from wastewater represents a promising and sensitive epidemiological tool to assess prevalence of fecally-shed pathogens in the community.","Neault, N.; Baig, A.

6,"Age-dependence of healthcare interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario, Canada","Background: Patient age is the most salient clinical indicator of risk from COVID-19. Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for most countries. However, relatively little attention has been given to the age distributions of hospitalizations and serious healthcare interventions administered to COVID-19 patients. We examined these distributions in Ontario, Canada, in order to quantify the age-related impacts of COVID-19, and to identify potential risks should the healthcare system become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the future. Methods: We analysed known SARS-CoV-2 infection records from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) and the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) between 23 January 2020 and 17 June 2020 (N = 30,546), and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. Results: The distribution of COVID-19-related hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 54-90, whereas deaths are sharply concentrated in very old ages, with a maximum at age 90. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection reaches a maximum of 32.0% at age 75 (95% CI 27.5%-36.7%). The probability of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization is uncertain for children (due to small sample size), and near 100% for adults younger than 40. After age 40, survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients declines substantially; for example, a hospitalized 50-year-old patient has a 90.4% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 81.9%-95.7%). Interpretation: Concerted efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have kept prevalence of the virus low in the population of Ontario. The healthcare system has not been overstretched, yet the probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 has been lower than is generally recognized for patients over 40. If prevalence of the virus were to increase and healthcare capacities were to be exceeded, survival of individuals in the broad age range requiring acute care would be expected to decrease, potentially expanding the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths toward younger ages.","Papst, I.; Li, M.; Champredon, D.; Bolker, B.

7,Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 dynamics using automated trend fitting and anomaly detection,"As several countries gradually release social distancing measures, rapid detection of new localised COVID-19 hotspots and subsequent intervention will be key to avoiding large-scale resurgence of transmission. We introduce ASMODEE (Automatic Selection of Models and Outlier Detection for Epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterise the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggest ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. We illustrate our method using publicly available data of NHS Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, for which we provide a template automated analysis pipeline. ASMODEE is implemented in the free R package trendbreaker.","Jombart, T.; Ghozzi, S.; Schumacher, D.; Leclerc, Q.; Jit, M.; Flasche, S.; Greaves, F.; Ward, T.; Eggo, R.

8,App-based symptom tracking to optimize SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy using machine learning,"Background: Tests are scarce resources, especially in low and middle-income countries, and the optimization of testing programs during a pandemic is critical for the effectiveness of the disease control. Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a regression model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. Materials and Methods: We applied machine learning techniques and provided a visualization of potential regions with high densities of COVID-19 as a risk map. We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in ""Dados do Bem"", an app-based symptom tracker in use in Brazil. Results: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4 - 4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5 - 2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). From the 287,714 users still not tested, our model estimated that only 34.5% are potentially infected, thus reducing the need for extensive testing of all registered users. The model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the state of Goias and found that of the 465 users selected, 52% tested positive. Conclusions: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies.","DANTAS, L.

9,The clinical course of COVID-19 in the outpatient setting: a prospective cohort study,"Background: Outpatient COVID-19 has been insufficiently characterized. Objective: To determine the progression of disease and subsequent determinants of hospitalization. Design: A prospective outpatient cohort. Setting: Outpatients were recruited by phone between April 21 to June 23, 2020 after receiving outpatient or emergency department testing within a large health network in Maryland, USA. Participants: Outpatient adults with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: Symptoms, portable pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate, and temperature were collected by participants on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after enrollment. Baseline demographics, comorbid conditions were evaluated for risk of subsequent hospitalization using negative binomial, logistic, and random effects logistic regression. Results: Among 118 SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, the median age was 56.0 years (IQR, 50.0 to 63.0) and 50 (42.4%) were male. Among those reporting active symptoms, the most common symptoms during the first week since symptom onset included weakness/fatigue (67.3%), cough (58.0%), headache (43.8%), and sore throat (34.8%). Participants returned to their usual health a median of 20 days (IQR, 13 to 38) from the symptom onset, and only 65.5% of respondents were at their usual health during the fourth week of illness. Over 28 days, 10.9% presented to the emergency department and 7.6% required hospitalization. Individuals at the same duration of illness had a 6.1 times increased adjusted odds of subsequent hospitalization per every percent decrease in home SaO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41 to 31.23, p=0.02). Limitations: Severity and duration of illness may differ in a younger population. Conclusion: Symptoms often persisted but uncommonly progressed to hospitalization.

10,Examination of Isolation Rate in SIQR model for COVID-19 Epidemic,"Newly proposed SIQR model defines exponent {lambda} of exponential function expressing daily number of isolated persons as linear equation of isolation rate q and social distancing ratio x. In order to dynamically analyze the process of COVID-19 epidemic in seven countries by means of regression analyses of {lambda}, increasing rate of cumulative isolated persons(cases), IRCC, is proposed as practical index for the isolation rate q. IRCC is correlated with q in the form of q=C*IRCC, where C is a normalizing coefficient. At first, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple and the other complex, under the constraint conditions by definition 0[&le;]x, q[&le;]1, which give allowable narrow path of C between upper and lower boundaries. Then, the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each of seven countries including Japan and the United States using formulated isolation rate q, and characteristic q-x behavior for each country is derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific path selection of C gives almost same linear loci of q-x relation derived by mathematical sequential method imitating a bipedal walk. In addition, increasing rates of cumulative PCR tests, IRCT, for six countries are discussed in relation with IRCC, and are shown that IRCT contributes to the promotion of the isolation rate via IRCC.","Hashiguchi, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185611v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185611v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True

12,Digital droplet PCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.","Vasudevan, H.; Xu, P.; Servellita, V.; Miller, S.; Liu, L.; Gopez, A.; Chiu, C.

13,"24 People, one test: Boosting test efficiency using pooled serum antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2","Background: The global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), with different prevalence rates across countries and regions. Dynamic testing strategies are mandatory to establish efficient mitigation strategies against the disease; to be cost effective, they should adapt to regional prevalences. Seroprevalence surveys that detect individuals who have mounted an immune response against COVID-19 will help to determine the total number of infections within a community and improve the epidemiological calculations of attack and case fatality rates of the virus. They will also inform about the percentage of a population that might be immune against re-infections. Methods: We developed a sensitive and specific cell-based assay to detect conformational SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) S1 antibodies in human serum, and have cross-evaluated this assay against two FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We performed pseudovirus neutralization assays to determine whether sera that were rated antibody-positive in our assay were able to specifically neutralize SARS-2-S. We pooled up to 24 sera and assessed the group testing performance of our cell-based assay. Group testing was further optimized by Monte Carlo like simulations and prospectively evaluated. Findings: Highly significant correlations could be established between our cell-based assay and commercial antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-2-S S1 antibody-positive sera neutralized SARS-2-S but not SARS-S, and were sensitively and specifically detected in pools of 24 samples. Monte Carlo like simulations demonstrated that a simple two-step pooling scheme with fixed pool sizes performed at least equally as well as Dorfman's optimal testing across a wide range of antibody prevalences. Interpretation: We demonstrate that a cell-based assay for SARS-2-S S1 antibodies qualifies for group testing of neutralizing anti-SARS-2-S antibodies. The assay can be combined with an easily implemented algorithm which greatly expands the screening capacity to detect anti-SARS-2-S antibodies across a wide range of antibody prevalences. It will thus improve population serological testing in many countries.","Nessler, S.; Franz, J.; van der Meer, F.; Kolotourou, K.; Venkataramani, V.; Hasan, C.; Beatrix Pollok-Kopp, B.; Zautner, A.

14,Systematic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived peptides for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients,"Serological test plays an essential role in monitoring and combating COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant spike protein (S protein), especially S1 protein is one of the major reagents for serological tests. However, the high cost in production of S protein, and the possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses poses unneglectable challenges. Taking advantage of a peptide microarray of full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, sera from 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results of the peptide microarray, we identified several S protein derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnosis performance. Particularly, for monitoring IgG response, one peptide (aa 1148-1159 or S2-78) has a comparable sensitivity (95.5%, 95% CI 93.7-96.9%) and specificity (96.7%, 95% CI 94.8-98.0%) to that of S1 protein for detection of both COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, the performance of S2-78 IgG for diagnosis was successfully validated by ELISA with an independent sample cohort. By combining S2-78/ S1 with other peptides, a two-step strategy was proposed to ensure both the sensitivity and specificity of S protein based serological assay. The peptide/s identified in this study could be applied independently or in combination with S1 protein for accurate, affordable, and accessible COVID-19 diagnosis.","Li, Y.; Lai, D.; Lei, Q.; Xu, Z.; Hou, H.; Shan, H.; Wang, F.; Fan, X.; Tao, S.-c.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186387v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186387v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
15,A model assessing potential benefits of isolation and mass testing on COVID-19: the case of Nigeria,"We consider a model with mass testing and isolation mimicking the current policies implemented in Nigeria and use the Nigerian daily cumulative cases to calibrate the model to obtain the optimal mass testing and isolation levels. Mathematical analysis was done and important thresholds such the peak size relation and final size relation were obtained. Global stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium indicated that COVID-19 can be eradicated provided that $mathcal{R}_0<1$ and unstable otherwise. Results from simulations revealed that an increase in mass testing and reduction of transmission from isolated individuals are associated with benefits of increasing detected cases, lowering peaks of symptomatic cases, increase in self-isolating cases, decrease in cumulative deaths and decrease in admissions into monitored isolation facilities in the case of Nigeria","Chirove, F.; Madubueze, C.

16,Cross-reactive antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal common cold coronaviruses,"While cross-reactive T cells epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal/common cold human coronaviruses (hCoVs) have been reported in individuals unexposed to SARS-CoV-2, potential antibody-based cross-reactivity is incompletely understood. Here, we have probed for high resolution antibody binding against all hCoVs represented as 1,539 peptides with a phage-displayed antigen library. We detected broad serum antibody responses against peptides of seasonal hCoVs in up to 75% of individuals. Recovered COVID-19 patients exhibited distinct antibody repertoires targeting variable SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and could be accurately classified from unexposed individuals (AUC=0.96). Up to 50% of recovered patients also mounted antibody responses against unique epitopes of seasonal hCoV-OC43, that were not detectable in unexposed individuals. These results indicate substantial interindividual variability and antibody cross-reactivity between hCoVs from the direction of SARS-CoV-2 infections towards seasonal hCoVs. Our accurate high throughput assay allows profiling preexisting antibody responses against seasonal hCoVs cost-effectively and could inform on their protective nature against SARS-CoV-2.","Vogl, T.; Klompus, S.; Leviathan, S.; Kalka, I.; Godneva, A.; Shinar, E.; Weinberger, A.; Segal, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20182220v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20182220v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
17,Development of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Specific Monoclonal Antibodies,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions in every society around the world. To help fight COVID-19, new molecular tools specifically targeting critical components of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is a major component of the viral replication processes, integral to viral particle assembly, and is a major diagnostic marker for infection and immune protection. Currently available antibody reagents targeting the nucleocapsid protein were primarily developed against the related SARS-CoV virus and are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, in this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies were tested in ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. The variable regions from the heavy and light chains from five select clones were cloned and sequenced, and preliminary epitope mapping of the sequenced clones was performed. Overall, the new antibody reagents described here will be of significant value in the fight against COVID-19.","Terry, J. S.; Anderson, L. B.; Scherman, M. S.; McAlister, C.

18,Boosting the analysis of protein interfaces with Multiple Interface String Alignment: illustration on the spikes of coronaviruses,"We introduce Multiple Interface String Alignment (MISA), a visualization tool to display coherently various sequence and structure based statistics at protein-protein interfaces (SSE elements, buried surface area, {Delta}ASA, B factor values, etc). The amino-acids supporting these annotations are obtained from Voronoi interface models. The benefit of MISA is to collate annotated sequences of (homologous) chains found in different biological contexts i.e. bound with different partners or unbound. The aggregated views MISA/SSE, MISA/BSA, MISA/{Delta}ASAetc make it trivial to identify commonalities and differences between chains, to infer key interface residues, and to understand where conformational changes occur upon binding. As such, they should prove of key relevance for knowledge based annotations of protein databases such as the Protein Data Bank. Illustrations are provided on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronaviruses, in complex with their cognate partner or (neutralizing) antibodies. MISA computed with a minimal number of structures complement and enrich findings previously reported.

19,Mutation in position of 32 (G>U) of S2M differentiate human SARS-CoV2 from Bat Coronavirus,"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic pathogen that has rapidly mutated and become transmissible to humans. There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3'UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes. While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models, when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.","Vahed, M.; Vahed, M.; Sweeney, A.; Shirazi, F.

20,Longitudinal single-cell immune profiling revealed distinct innate immune response in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients,"Recent studies have characterized the single-cell immune landscape of host immune response of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), specifically focus on the severe condition. However, the immune response in mild or even asymptomatic patients remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2. Our data suggest early innate immune response and type I immunity may contribute to the asymptomatic phenotype in COVID-19 disease, which could in turn deepen our understanding of severe COVID-19 and guide early prediction and therapeutics.","Zhao, X.-N.; You, Y.; Wang, G.-L.; Gao, H.-X.; Cui, X.-M.; Duan, L.-J.; Zhang, S.-B.; Wang, Y.-L.; Yao, L.; Li, L.; Lu, J.-H.; Wang, H.-B.; Fan, J.-F.; Zheng, H.-W.; Dai, E.-H.; Tian, L.; Ma, M.-J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.276865v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.276865v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,False
21,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a novel target of the γ-secretase complex,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, but also the functional receptor of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on structural similarity with other {gamma}-secretase ({gamma}S) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by {gamma}S proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by {gamma}S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of {gamma}S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of {gamma}S does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.","Bartolome, A.; Liang, J.; Wang, P.; Ho, D.

22,A Single Dose of Self-Transcribing and Replicating RNA Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Produces Protective Adaptive Immunity In Mice,"A self-transcribing and replicating RNA (STARR) based vaccine (LUNAR-COV19) has been developed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-gamma; and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 microgram and 10 microgram doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 genomes full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

24,Pooling saliva to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity,"Expanding testing capabilities is integral to managing the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 and developing reopening strategies, particularly in regards to identifying and isolating asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Central to meeting testing demands are specimens that can be easily and reliably collected and laboratory capacity to rapidly ramp up to scale. We and others have demonstrated that high and consistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in saliva from COVID-19 inpatients, outpatients, and asymptomatic individuals. As saliva collection is non-invasive, extending this strategy to test pooled saliva samples from multiple individuals could thus provide a simple method to expand testing capacity. However, hesitation towards pooled sample testing arises due to the dilution of positive samples, potentially shifting weakly positive samples below the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 and thereby decreasing the sensitivity. Here, we investigated the potential of pooling saliva samples by 5, 10, and 20 samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on samples tested, we conservatively estimated a reduction of 7.41%, 11.11%, and 14.81% sensitivity, for each of the pool sizes, respectively. Using these estimates we modeled anticipated changes in RT-qPCR cycle threshold to show the practical impact of pooling on results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. In tested populations with greater than 3% prevalence, testing samples in pools of 5 requires the least overall number of tests. Below 1% however, pools of 10 or 20 are more beneficial and likely more supportive of ongoing surveillance strategies.","Watkins, A. E.; Fenichel, E. P.; Weinberger, D. M.; Vogels, C. B.

25,Healthcare Worker Attendance During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Analysis of Daily Fingerprint-Verified Data from All Public-Sector Secondary and Tertiary Care Facilities in Bangladesh,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals in several areas in high-income countries. An effective response to this pandemic requires healthcare workers (HCWs) to be present at work, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are already in critically low supply. To inform whether and to what degree policymakers in Bangladesh, and LMICs more broadly, should expect a drop in HCW attendance as COVID-19 continues to spread, this study aims to determine how HCW attendance has changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods. This study analyzed daily fingerprint-verified attendance data from all 527 public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh to describe HCW attendance from January 26, 2019 to March 22, 2020, by cadre, hospital type, and geographic division. We then regressed HCW attendance onto fixed effects for day-of-week, month, and hospital, as well as indicators for each of three pandemic periods: a China-focused period (January 11, 2020 [first confirmed COVID-19 death in China] until January 29, 2020), international-spread period (January 30, 2020 [World Health Organization declared a global emergency] until March 6, 2020), and local-spread period (March 7, 2020 [first confirmed COVID-19 case in Bangladesh] until the end of the study period). Findings. On average between January 26, 2019 and March 22, 2020, 34.1% of doctors, 64.6% of nurses, and 70.6% of other healthcare staff were present for their scheduled shift. Attendance rate increased with time in 2019 among all cadres. Attendance level of nurses dropped by 2.5% points (95% CI; -3.2% to -1.8%) and 3.5% points (95% CI; -4.5% to -2.5%) during the international-spread and the local-spread periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the China-focused period. Similarly, the attendance level of other healthcare staff declined by 0.3% points (95% CI; -0.8% to 0.2%) and 2.3% points (95% CI; -3.0% to -1.6%) during the international-spread and local-spread periods, respectively. Among doctors, however, the international-spread and local-spread periods were associated with a statistically significant increase in attendance by 3.7% points (95% CI; 2.5% to 4.8%) and 4.9% points (95% CI; 3.5% to 6.4%), respectively. The reduction in attendance levels across all HCWs during the local-spread period was much greater at large hospitals, where the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment took place, than that at small hospitals. Conclusions. After a year of significant improvements, attendance levels among nurses and other healthcare staff (who form the majority of the healthcare workforce in Bangladesh) have declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may portend an even greater decrease in attendance if COVID-19 continues to spread in Bangladesh. Policymakers in Bangladesh and similar LMICs should undertake major efforts to achieve high attendance levels among HCWs, particularly nurses, such as by providing sufficient personal protective equipment as well as monetary and non-monetary incentives.","Do, D.; Sarker, M.; Chen, S.; Lenjani, A.; Tikka, P.; Barnighausen, T.; Geldsetzer, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186445v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186445v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
26,"Dark matter, second waves and epidemiological modelling","Background Recent reports based on conventional SEIR models suggest that the next wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK could overwhelm health services, with fatalities that far exceed the first wave. These models suggest non-pharmaceutical interventions would have limited impact without intermittent national lockdowns and consequent economic and health impacts. We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, when allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, and viral transmission. Methods We used dynamic causal modelling to estimate the parameters of epidemiological models and, crucially, the evidence for alternative models of the same data. We compared SEIR models of immune status that were equipped with latent factors generating data; namely, location, symptom, and testing status. We analysed daily cases and deaths from the US, UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Belgium, Germany, and Canada over the period 25-Jan-20 to 15-Jun-20. These data were used to estimate the composition of each country's population in terms of the proportions of people (i) not exposed to the virus, (ii) not susceptible to infection when exposed, and (iii) not infectious when susceptible to infection. Findings Bayesian model comparison found overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, and transmission. Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient to explain the large differences in mortality rates across countries. The best model of UK data predicts a second surge of fatalities will be much less than the first peak (31 vs. 998 deaths per day. 95% CI: 24-37)--substantially less than conventional model predictions. The size of the second wave depends sensitively upon the loss of immunity and the efficacy of find-test-trace-isolate-support (FTTIS) programmes. Interpretation A dynamic causal model that incorporates heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially, the potential of public health programmes.","Friston, K.; Costello, A.; Pillay, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185876v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185876v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
27,A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, M.

28,"The discovery of gene mutations making SARS-CoV-2 well adapted for humans: host-genome similarity analysis of 2594 genomes from China, the USA and Europe","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo . A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","Sun, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,False
29,The Impact of Psychology Interventions on Changing Mental Health Status and Sleep Quality in University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract Objective We evaluated the change in mental health and sleep quality of college students at four time periods. Methods Mental health status and sleep quality were using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaire across four time periods. Psychology interventions were carried out from the third period. Results Students in the third period had higher PSQI total scores [mean (SD), 6.01 (3.27)] than those in the first period [5.60 (3.11)], second period [4.17 (2.10)] and fourth period [4.09 (2.80)]. After adjustment for covariates there was a decline of 1.89 points in the PSQI in the fourth period compared with the highest period. The SCL-90-R scores were highest in the second period [121.19 (47.83)], and were higher than the scores in the first [107.60 (52.21)] and second period [107.79 (27.20)] and lowest in the fourth period [97.82 (17.12)]. The decline in scores was 23.38 points after adjustment for covariates. The prevalence of psychological distress and sleep disturbances respectively decreased from 28.6% to 11.7% and from 10.4% to 2.6% comparing to the highest period. Sleep quality showed a significant positive correlation with mental health status. Conclusions The pattern of change in mental health status was different to that of sleep quality. The implementation of comprehensive psychology intervention may improve mental health and sleep quality. These findings may inform public health policy during the reopening of schools in other regions.","Xiao, J.; Jiang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Gu, X.; Ma, W.; Zhuang, B.; Zhou, Z.; Sang, L.; Luo, Y.; Lian, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186411v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20186411v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
30,Biologic agents for rheumatic diseases in the break of COVID-19: friend or foe?,"Background: The recent outbreak of COVID19 has raised concerns in the rheumatology community about the management of immunosuppressive patients diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. It is not clear whether the use of biologic agents may suppose a risk or protection against SARSCoV2 infection however, it has been suggested that severe respiratory forms of COVID19 occur as result of exacerbated inflammation status and cytokine production. This prompted the use of IL6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL1 inhibitors (anakinra) in severe COVID19 disease and more recently JAK1/2 inhibitor (baricitinib). Therefore, patients with rheumatic diseases provide a great opportunity to learn about the use of biological agents as protective drugs against SARSCoV2. Objectives: To estimate COVID19 infection rate in patients treated with biologic agents for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, determine the influence of biologic agents treatment as a risk or protective factor and studying the prognosis of rheumatic patients receiving biologic agents compared to general population in a third level Hospital setting in Leon, Spain. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study including patients seen at Rheumatology department who received biological therapy for rheumatic diseases between December 1st 2019 and June 1st 2020 and analysed COVID19 infection rate. All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic with diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving treatment with biologic agents were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID19. The covariates were age, sex, comorbidities, biologic agent and need for hospitalization. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. Results: There was a total of 3711 patients with COVID19 requiring hospitalization. 30 patients out of a total of 820 patients (3.6%) receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID19 and four required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 2.75%, and it was 0.48% among the group with underlying rheumatic diseases. A total of 423 patients died, 2 of which received treatment with biologic agents. Patients who tested positive for COVID19 were older (female: median age 61.8 IQR 46.5 to 75; male: median age 68 IQR 48.5 to 72) than those who were negative for COVID19 (female: median age 58.4 IQR 48 to 69; male: median age 55.9 IQR 46 to 66) and more likely to have cardiovascular disease (27 % vs 10%, OR 3. 41 (CI 1.47 to 7.94), p 0.004), be active smokers (13% vs 5%, OR 3.14 (CI 1.04 to 9.47), p 0.04) and receiving treatment with IL-12/23 inhibitors (6.7% vs 1.4%, OR 5.06 (CI 1.07 to 23.91) and rituximab (13% vs 2%, 2.66 (CI 1.03 to 7.27), p 0.04) and were less likely to be receiving treatment with IL6 inhibitors (0% vs 14%, CI (0.006 to 0.97, p <0.05). When exploring the effect of the rest of the therapies between groups (affected patients vs unaffected), we found no significant differences in bsDMARD proportions. IL1 inhibitors, IL6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors and belimumab treated patients showed the lowest incidence of COVID19 among adult rheumatic patients. We found no differences in sex or rheumatological disease between patients who tested positive for COVID19 and patients who tested negative were found. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of biological therapy does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID19, and it is likely to have a protective effect against them when compared to the general population.","Sieiro Santos, C.; Casas Fernandez, X.; Moriano Morales, C.; Alvarez Diez, E.; Alvarez Castro, C.; Lopez Robles, A.; Perez Sandoval, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20184333v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20184333v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
31,Estimating the number of COVID-19 cases being introduced into British Higher Education Institutions during Autumn 2020,"It is estimated that 81% of the 163 UK Higher Educational Institutes (HEIs) have more than a 50% chance of having at least one COVID-19 case arriving on campus when considering all staff and students. Across all HEIs it is estimated that there will be a total of approximately 700 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 640 - 750) arriving on campus of which 380 are associated from UK students, 230 from international and 90 from staff. This assumes all students will return to campus and that student numbers and where they come from are similar to previous years. According to the current UK government guidance approximately 237,370 students arriving on campus will be required to quarantine because they come from countries outwith designated travel corridors. Assuming quarantining is 100% efficient this will potentially reduce the overall number of cases by approximately 20% to 540 (95% CI: 500 - 590). Universities must plan for COVID-19 cases to arrive on campus and facilitate mitigations to reduce the spread of disease. It is likely that the first two weeks will be crucial to stop spread of introduced cases. Following that, the risk of introduction of new cases onto campus will be from interactions between students, staff and the local community as well as students travelling off campus for personal, educational or recreational reasons.","Perez-Reche, F.; Strachan, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186676v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186676v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
32,Effects of Public Health Interventions on the Epidemiological Spread During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Thailand,"A novel infectious respiratory disease was recognized in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in December 2019. In February 2020, the disease was named ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19). COVID-19 became a pandemic in March 2020, and, since then, different countries have implemented a broad spectrum of policies. Thailand is considered to be among the top countries in handling its first wave of the outbreak -- 12 January to 31 July 2020. Here, we illustrate how Thailand tackled the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly the effects of public health interventions on the epidemiological spread. This study shows how the available data from the outbreak can be analyzed and visualized to quantify the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of the interventions, and the level of risk of allowed activities during an easing of a ""lockdown."" This study shows how a well-organized governmental apparatus can overcome the havoc caused by a pandemic.","Triukose, S. D.; Nitinawarat, S. D.; Satian, P.; Somboonsavatdee, A. D.; Chotikarn, P.

33,SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence and stability in a tertiary care hospital-setting,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection has caused 64,469 deaths in India, with 7, 81, 975 active cases till 30th August 2020, lifting it to 3rd rank globally. To estimate the burden of the disease with time it is important to undertake a longitudinal seroprevalence study which will also help to understand the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Various studies have been conducted worldwide to assess the antibody stability. However, there is very limited data available from India. Healthcare workers (HCW) are the frontline workforce and more exposed to the COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the community. This study was conceptualized with an aim to estimate the seroprevalence in hospital and general population and determine the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW. Methods: Staff of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi and individuals visiting that hospital were recruited between April to August 2020. Venous blood sample, demographic, clinical, COVID-19 symptoms, and RT-PCR data was collected from all participants. Serological testing was performed using the electro-chemiluminescence based assay developed by Roche Diagnostics, in Cobas Elecsys 411. Seropositive participants were followed- upto 83 days to check for the presence of antibodies. Results: A total of 780 participants were included in this study, which comprised 448 HCW and 332 individuals from the general population. Among the HCW, seroprevalence rates increased from 2.3% in April to 50.6% in July. The cumulative prevalence was 16.5% in HCW and 23.5% (78/332) in the general population with a large number of asymptomatic individuals. Out of 74 seropositive HCWs, 51 were followed-up for the duration of this study. We observed that in all seropositive cases the antibodies were sustained even up to 83 days. Conclusion: The cumulative prevalence of seropositivity was lower in HCWs than the general population. There were a large number of asymptomatic cases and the antibodies developed persisted through the duration of the study. More such longitudinal serology studies are needed to better understand the antibody response kinetics.","Siddiqui, S.; Naushin, S.; Pradhan, S.; Misra, A.; Tyagi, A.; Loomba, M.; Waghdhare, S.; Pandey, R.; Sengupta, S.; Jha, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186486v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186486v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
34,Exploring options for reprocessing of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) amidst COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"Background: There is global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to COVID-19 pandemic. N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs. Aim: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. Findings and Conclusions: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies. We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.","Paul, D.; Gupta, A.; Maurya, A.

35,Onset of effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 worldwide,"During the initial phase of the global COVID-19 outbreak, most countries responded with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The effectiveness of these NPIs has been investigated with simulation studies, that rely on assumptions and by empirical studies with few countries and controversial results. However, it has not been investigated in detail how long different NPIs need to be in place to take effect, or how long they should be in place for their maximum effect to unfold. We used global data and a non-parametric machine learning model to estimate the effects of NPIs in relation to how long they have been in place. Here we show that closure and regulation of schools was the most important NPI, associated with a pronounced effect about 10 days after implementation. Restrictions of mass gatherings and restrictions and regulations of businesses were found to have a more gradual effect, and social distancing was associated with a delayed effect starting about 18 days after implementation. Generally, effects increased until about 40 to 50 days after implementation. Our results can inform political decisions regarding the choice of NPIs and how long they need to be in place to take effect.","Zeilinger, E. L.; Nader, I.

37,Inhaled corticosteroid use in COVID-19,"Background Recent evidence has established a beneficial effect of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. However, it is unknown if inhaled corticosteroid use is associated with reduced morbidity of the disease. Methods In a nationwide cohort of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 test-positive individuals in Denmark, we estimated the 30-day hazard ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death among users of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with users of non-ICS inhalers ({beta}2-agonist/muscarinic-antagonists), or non-users of ICS, with Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other confounders. We repeated these analyses among influenza test-positive patients during 2010-2018. Results Among 2,180 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, 282 were admitted to ICU and 421 died within 30 days. ICS use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI [CI], 0.60 to 2.61) for ICU admission and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use. Compared with no ICS use, the hazard ratio of ICU admission or death was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.47), respectively. Among 10,279 hospitalized influenza patients, the hazard ratios were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.46) for ICU admission, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.22) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use and no ICS use, respectively. Conclusions Our results do not support an effect of inhaled corticosteroid use on COVID-19 morbidity, however we can only rule out moderate-to-large reduced or increased risks.","Husby, A.; Pottegaard, A.; Hviid, A.

38,Vaccination for some childhood diseases may impact the outcome of covid-19 infections,"Background: COVID-19 found the world in a state of unpreparedness. While research efforts to develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate immunity. Objective: We analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies. Results: Mean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guerin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella- containing vaccine 1st dose (r= -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5), Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries, only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was associated with poorer recoveries. Conclusion: Our analysis corroborates the potential benefit of vaccination and warrant further research to explore the rationale for repurposing other vaccines to fight COVID-19.","Gobe, I.; Koto, G.

40,Performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1 as a sentinel of Covid-19,"Background Since 1920, a decrease in serum cholesterol has been identified as a marker of severe pneumonia. We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 sera) and in France (20,652 sera) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 sera, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0;P=0.04). Conclusion Apolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population.

41,Multiplexed Detection and Quantification of Human Antibody Response to COVID-19 Infection Using a Plasmon Enhanced Biosensor Platform,"The 2019 SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate tests to diagnose acute infection and immune response to infection. A multiplexed assay built on grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) was shown to have 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The entire assay takes less than 30 min, making it highly competitive with well-established ELISA and immunofluorescence assays. GC-FP is quantitative over a large dynamic range, providing a linear response for serum titers ranging from 1:25 to 1:1,600, and shows high correlation with both ELISA and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) (Pearson r > 0.9). Compatibility testing with dried blood spot samples (n = 63) demonstrated 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity. A machine learning (ML) model was trained to classify dried blood spot samples for prior COVID-19 infection status, based on the combined antibody response to S1, S1S2, and Nuc antigens. The ML model yielded 100% selectivity and 80% sensitivity and demonstrated a higher stringency than diagnosis with a single antibody-antigen response. The platform is flexible and will readily accommodate IgG, IgM, and IgA. Further, the assay uses sub-nanogram quantities of capture ligand and is thus readily modified to include additional antigens, which is shown by the addition of RBD in later iterations of the test. The combination of rapid, multiplexed, and quantitative detection for both blood serum and dried blood spot samples makes GC-FP an attractive approach for COVID-19 antibody testing.","Cady, N.

42,COMPARISON OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ENABLED METHODS IN THE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 DISEASE.,"Objectives: Comparison of three different Artificial intelligence (AI) methods of assessment for patients undergoing Computed tomography (CT) for suspected Covid-19 disease. Parameters studied were probability of diagnosis, quantification of disease severity and the time to reach the diagnosis . Methods: 107 consecutive patients of suspected Covid-19 patients were evaluated using the three AI methods labeled as AI-I,II, III alongwith visual analysis labeled as VT for predicting probability of Covid-19, determining CT severity score (CTSS) and index (CTSI) , percentage opacification (PO) and high opacification (POHO). Sensitivity, specificity along with area under curves were estimated for each method and the CTSS and CTSI correlated using Friedman test. Results: Out of 107 patients 71 patients were Covid-19 positive and 20 negative by RT-PCR while 16 did not get RT-PCR done. AI-III method showed higher sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 88% respectively to predict probability of Covid 19. It had 2 false positive patients of interstitial lung disease. AI-II method had sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 83% respectively while visual (VT) analysis showed sensitivity and specificity of 59.7% and 62% respectively. Statistically significant differences were also seen in CTSI and PO estimation between AI-I and III methods (p<0.0001) with AI-III showing fastest time to calculate results. Conclusions: AI-III method gave better results to make an accurate and quick diagnosis of the Covid-19 with AUC of 0.85 to predict probability of Covid-19 alongwith quantification of Covid-19 lesions in the form of PO, POHO as compared to other AI methods and also by visual analysis.","Kapoor, A.; Mahajan, G.; Kapoor, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186650v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186650v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True

We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19. We created corresponding cohorts for patients with influenza in 2017-2018. We followed patients from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of socio-demographics, prior comorbidities, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. Findings: We included 627 044 COVID-19 (US: 502 650, Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336) and 4 549 568 influenza (US: 4 431 801, Spain: 115 224, UK: 2543) patients. The prevalence of obesity was higher among hospitalized COVID-19 (range: 38% to 54%) than diagnosed COVID-19 (30% to 47%), or diagnosed/hospitalized influenza (15% to 48%) patients. Obese hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more often female and younger than non-obese COVID-19 patients or obese influenza patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to have prior comorbidities, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, require intensive services, or die compared to non-obese COVID-19 patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were also more likely to require intensive services or die compared to obese influenza patients, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. Interpretation: We show that obesity is more common among COVID-19 than influenza patients, and that obese patients present with more severe forms of COVID-19 with higher hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality than non-obese patients.

44,Computed Tomography Features of COVID-19 in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Objectives: To systematically analyze the chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 and provide references for clinical practice. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu. Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software. Results: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study. The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8-70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8-71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1-78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis. The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7-48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1-67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8-72.2%). Other imaging features included nodules (25.7%), patchy shadows (36.8%), halo sign (24.8%), consolidation (24.1%), air bronchogram signs (11.2%), cord-like shadows (9.7%), crazy-paving pattern (6.1%), and pleural effusion (9.1%). Two articles reported three cases of white lung, another reported two cases of pneumothorax, and another one case of bullae. CONCLUSION: The lung CT results of children with COVID-19 are usually normal or slightly atypica, with a low sensitivity and specificity compared with that in adults. The lung lesions of COVID-19 pediatric patients mostly involve both lungs or multiple lobes, and the common manifestations are patchy shadows, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, partial air bronchogram signs, nodules, and halo signs; white lung, pleural effusion, and paving stone signs are rare. CLINICAL IMPACT: Therefore, chest CT has limited value as a screening tool for children with COVID-19 and can only be used as an auxiliary assessment tool.","Wang, J.-G.; Mo, Y.-F.; Su, Y.-h.; Wang, L.-c.; Liu, G.-b.; Li, M.; Qin, Q.-q.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187187v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187187v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True

46,Modelling the impact of travel restrictions on COVID-19 cases in Newfoundland and Labrador,"BACKGROUND: In many jurisdictions public health authorities have implemented travel restrictions to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread. Previous research has considered the impact of international travel restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics, but in response to the pandemic, policies that restrict travel within countries have also been implemented, and the impact of these restrictions is less well studied. On May 4th, 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) implemented travel restrictions such that non-residents were required to have exemptions to enter the province. METHODS: We fit a stochastic epidemic model to data describing the number of active COVID-19 cases in NL from March 14th - May 4th. We then predicted possible outbreaks over the 9 weeks subsequent to May 4th, with and without the travel restrictions, and for physical distancing scenarios ranging from a 40% to 70% reduction in the daily contact rate relative to pre-pandemic levels. RESULTS: We find that the mean number of clinical COVID-19 cases would have been 12.4 times higher without the travel restrictions. Furthermore, without the travel restrictions there is a substantial risk of very large outbreaks. INTERPRETATION: Using epidemic modelling, we show how the NL COVID-19 outbreak could have unfolded had the travel restrictions not been implemented. Both physical distancing and travel restrictions affect the local dynamics of the epidemic. Our modelling shows that the travel restrictions are a plausible reason why there were so few reported COVID-19 cases in NL in the 9 weeks after May 4th.","Hurford, A.; Rahman, P.; Loredo-Osti, J.

47,Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospital Admissions from COVID-19 and Determining the Impact of Neighborhood Deprivation and Primary Language.,"Importance Despite past and ongoing efforts to achieve health equity in the United States, persistent disparities in socioeconomic status along with multilevel racism maintain disparate outcomes and appear to be amplified by COVID-19. Objective Measure socioeconomic factors and primary language effects on the risk of COVID-19 severity across and within racial/ethnic groups. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in the U.S. between March 4, 2020 to August 19, 2020. Participants PCR+ COVID-19 patients. Patients missing race or ethnicity data or those diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospitalization were excluded. Exposures Main exposures included race/ethnicity, area deprivation index (ADI), and primary language. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis. Logistic and competing-risk regression models (censored at 45 days and accounting for the competing risk of death prior to hospitalization) assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. Results 5,577 COVID-19 patients were included, 866 (n=15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 years, IQR: 45.7-75.9 vs. 40.4 years, IQR: 25.6-58.3, p<0.001) and more likely to be male (n=425 [49.1%] vs. 2,049 [43.5%], p=0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n=381), 19.9% (n=172), 18.6% (n=161), and 11.8% (n=102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity; Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). Surprisingly ADI was not associated with hospitalization; however, consistent trends within racial/ethnic groups were observed. Furthermore, non-English speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. Conclusions Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes during the pandemic. Non-English speaking also accounts for between and within minority populations. These results support continued concern that racism contributes to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity across and within minority groups.","Ingraham, N.

48,Post-Anticoagulant D-dimer as a Highly Prognostic Biomarker of COVID-19 Mortality,"Importance: Clinical biomarkers that accurately predict mortality are needed for the effective management of patients with severe COVID-19 illness. Objective: To determine whether D-dimer levels after anticoagulation treatment is predictive of in-hospital mortality. Design: Retrospective study using electronic health record data. Setting: A large New York City hospital network serving a diverse, urban patient population. Participants: Adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 infection who received therapeutic anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis between February 25, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Exposures: Mean and trend of D-dimer levels in the 3 days following the first therapeutic dose of anticoagulation. Main Outcomes: In-hospital mortality versus discharge. Results: 1835 adult patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 57-78]; 58% male) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who received therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization were included. 74% (1365) of patients were discharged and 26% (430) died in hospital. The study cohort was divided into four groups based on the mean D-dimer levels and its trend following anticoagulation initiation, with significantly different in-hospital mortality rates (p<0.001): 49% for the high mean-increase trend (HI) group; 27% for the high-decrease (HD) group; 21% for the low-increase (LI) group; and 9% for the low-decrease (LD) group. Using penalized logistic regression models to simultaneously analyze 67 variables (baseline demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, D-dimer levels), post-anticoagulant D-dimer groups had the highest adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) for predicting in-hospital mortality. The ORadj of in-hospital death among patients from the HI group was 6.58 folds (95% CI 3.81-11.16) higher compared to the LD group. The LI (ORadj: 4.06, 95% CI 2.23-7.38) and HD (ORadj: 2.37; 95% CI 1.37-4.09) groups were also associated with higher mortality compared to the LD group. Conclusions and Relevance: D-dimer levels and its trend following the initiation of anticoagulation have high and independent predictive value for in-hospital mortality. This novel prognostic biomarker should be incorporated into management protocols to guide resource allocation and prospective studies for emerging treatments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Song, X.; Ji, J.; Reva, B.; Joshi, H.; Calinawan, A.

49,Pleotropic association between risk and prognosis of COVID-19 and gene expression in blood and lung: A Mendelian randomization analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified potential genetic factors involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear. Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically/potentially causally associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. The GWAS summarized data for COVID-19 were provided by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative and the Severe Covid-19 GWAS Group. Analyses were done for blood and lung, respectively. Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (beta [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75E06 and beta [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76E06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation. Conclusion: We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in of the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic target for effective treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, D.; Yang, J.; Feng, B.; Lu, W.; Zhao, C.; Li, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187179v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187179v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
50,Defining the role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission: a living systematic review,"Background Reports suggest that asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms at all throughout the infection) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are infectious, but the extent of asymptomatic transmission requires further understanding. Purpose This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms. Study selection Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in either English or Chinese were included. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested. Data synthesis Of 928 studies identified, 19 were included. Secondary attack rates from asymptomatic index cases ranged from 0% to 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged from 0.7% to 31.8% (10 studies). The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case. Limitations We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity, we did not produce a summary estimate of the included studies. Conclusion Asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.

In this study, we use statistical methods to show how to detect the presence of seasonality in a pandemic at the beginning of the seasonal period and that seasonality strongly affects SARS-coV-2 transmission. We measure the expected seasonality effect in the mean transmission rate of SARS-coV-2 and use available data to predict when a second wave of the Covid-19 will happen. In addition, we measure the average global effect of social distancing measures. The seasonal force of transmission of Covid-19 increases in September in the Northern hemisphere and in April in the Southern hemisphere. These predictions provide critical information for public health officials to plan their actions to combat the new coronavirus disease and to identify and measure seasonal effects in a future pandemic.","Watanabe, M.

52,An epidemic model for economical impact predicting and spatiotemporal spreading of COVID-19,"Since the emergence of a new strain of coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, many countries around the world have reported cases of COVID-19 disease caused by this virus. Numerous people's lives have been affected both from a health and an economic point of view. The long tradition of using mathematical models to generate insights about the transmission of a disease, as well as new computer techniques such as Artificial Intelligence, have opened the door to diverse investigations providing relevant information about the evolution of COVID-19. In this research, we seek to advance the existing epidemiological models based on microscopic Markov chains to predict the impact of the pandemic at medical and economic levels. For this purpose, we have made use of the Spanish population movements based on mobile-phone geographically-located information to determine its economic activity using Artificial Intelligence techniques and have developed a novel advanced epidemiological model that combines this information with medical data. With this tool, scenarios can be released with which to determine which restriction policies are optimal and when they have to be applied both to limit the destruction of the economy and to avoid the feared possible upsurge of the disease.","Camara, M.; Miravete, M.; Navarro, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186551v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186551v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True

Data suitable for this purpose are scant. We used national surveillance PCR test, serological survey and mobility data to develop and fit a county-specific transmission model for Kenya. We estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peaked before the end of July 2020 in the major urban counties, with 34 - 41% of residents infected, and will peak elsewhere in the country within 2-3 months. Despite this penetration, reported severe cases and deaths are low. Our analysis suggests the COVID-19 disease burden in Kenya may be far less than initially feared.

54,Maximizing and evaluating the impact of test-trace-isolate programs,"Background: Test-trace-isolate programs are an essential part of COVID-19 control that offer a more targeted approach than many other non-pharmaceutical interventions. Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. Methods and Findings: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0=2.5, generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the ""test"" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","Grantz, K.

55,Could seasonal influenza vaccination influence COVID-19 risk?,"Background: With possible resurgence of the SARS-CoV-2 and low seasonal influenza virus circulation next winter, reviewing evidence on a possible interaction between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 risk is important. Objective: To review studies on the effect of influenza vaccines on non-influenza respiratory disease (NIRD). Methods: Using different search strategies, 18 relevant studies were identified and their strength, limitations and significance were assessed. Results: Analysis of 4 RCT datasets did not suggest increased NIRD risk in recipients of live-attenuated vaccines (LAIV) and results of a cohort study suggested short-term protection consistent with the hypothesis of trained immunity. One RCT, four cohort studies and one test-negative case-control suggested increased NIRD risk in recipients of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), whereas five test-negative case-control studies did not show an increased risk associated with a specific viral pathogen. Cross-protection against COVID-19 was suggested in one cross-sectional study on IIV but major biases could not be excluded. Results of four recent ecological studies on COVID-19 were challenging to interpret. Conclusions: Available data on LAIV are reassuring but not all those on IIV. A drastic reorientation of 2020-2021 influenza campaigns is probably not warranted but studies aiming to test COVID-19 risk modification among recipients of seasonal influenza vaccines should be planned and funded.","De wals, P.; Divangahi, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186734v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186734v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
56,The impact of high frequency rapid viral antigen screening on COVID-19 spread and outcomes: a validation and modeling study,"High frequency screening of populations has been proposed as a strategy in facilitating control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we use computational modeling, coupled with clinical data from a rapid antigen test, to predict the impact of frequent rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and outcomes. Using patient nasopharyngeal swab specimens, we demonstrate that the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test compared to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) are 84.7% and 85.7%, respectively; moreover, sensitivity correlates directly with viral load. Based on COVID-19 data from three regions in the United States and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, we show that high frequency, strategic population-wide rapid testing, even at varied accuracy levels, diminishes COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid detection via qRT-PCR. We propose large-scale antigen-based surveillance as a viable strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 spread and to enable societal re-opening.","Nash, B.; Badea, A.; Reddy, A.; Bosch, M.; Salcedo, N.; Gomez, A.

57,An intestinal cell type in zebrafish is the nexus for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contributes to COVID-19 comorbidities,"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

SUMMARY STATEMENTGenomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.","Postlethwait, J.; Farnsworth, D.

58,Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness and neutralization susceptibility,"A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an ""up"" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.

ImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.","Plante, J. A.; Liu, Y.; Liu, J.; Xia, H.; Johnson, B.

59,SARS-CoV-2 causes severe alveolar inflammation and barrier dysfunction,"Infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Böttcher, S.; Häring, C.; Giebeler, L.; Henke, A.; Zell, R.; Hornung, F.; Brandt, C.; Marquet, M.; Mosig, A.

60,Structural Variants in SARS-CoV-2 Occur at Template-Switching Hotspots,"The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5' and 3' breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads,  these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of  de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in ""arms"" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.","Chrisman, B.; Paskov, K.; Stockham, N.; Tabatabaei, K.; Jung, J.-Y.; Washington, P.; Varma, M.; Woo Sun, M.; Maleki, S.; Wall, D.

61,Prime-boost protein subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are highly immunogenic in mice and macaques,"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are advancing into human clinical trials, with emphasis on eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S). However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, H.-X.; Juno, J. A.; Lee, W.

Therefore, a laboratory developed multiplexed RT-PCR protocol (LDT) that detects and differentiates the four hCoV NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 was adapted on the PF. The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene LDT and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or the R-GENE hCoV / hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively. For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3% concordant with two specimens discordantly positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified 23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a single specimen discordantly positive. Moreover, 36 samples from proficiency testing panels were detected and typed correctly by both novel methods. In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV enhanced the diagnostic spectrum of the PF for all coronaviruses circulating globally for a multitude of diagnostic materials from the upper and lower respiratory tract.","Cordes, A.

63,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with a human intestine-on-chip device,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","Guo, Y.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Deng, P.; Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Zhang, X.; Cui, K.; Tao, T.; Li, Z.; Chen, W.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1,2020-09-02,2020-09-02,,False
64,Induction of a regulatory myeloid program in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19,"A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis. To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reyes, M.; Filbin, M.

This study employed deep-learning convolutional neural networks to classify COVID-19 lung infections on pCXR from normal and related lung infections to potentially enable more timely and accurate diagnosis. This retrospect study employed deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning to classify based on pCXRs COVID-19 pneumonia (N=455) on pCXR from normal (N=532), bacterial pneumonia (N=492), and non-COVID viral pneumonia (N=552). The data was split into 75% training and 25% testing. A five-fold cross-validation was used. Performance was evaluated using receiver-operating curve analysis. Comparison was made with CNN operated on the whole pCXR and segmented lungs. CNN accurately classified COVID-19 pCXR from those of normal, bacterial pneumonia, and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients in a multiclass model. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.79, 0.93, and 0.79, 0.85 respectively (whole pCXR), and were 0.91, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.89 (CXR of segmented lung). The performance was generally better using segmented lungs. Heatmaps showed that CNN accurately localized areas of hazy appearance, ground glass opacity and/or consolidation on the pCXR. Deep-learning convolutional neural network with transfer learning accurately classifies COVID-19 on portable chest x-ray against normal, bacterial pneumonia or non-COVID viral pneumonia.

Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2.

67,Drug repurposing screen identifies masitinib as a 3CLpro inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Drayman, N.; Jones, K.

68,Characterization of neutralizing versus binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India,"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses.

69,A versatile reporter system to monitor virus infected cells and its application to dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, F.; Neufeldt, C.

Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission.

We identified three PLpro and four Mpro inhibitors superior to ebselen. Our work shows that ebselen constitutes a promising platform for development of new antiviral agents targeting both SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro.","Zmudzinski, M.; Rut, W.; Olech, K.; Granda, J.; Giurg, M.; Burda-Grabowska, M.; Zhang, L.; Sun, X.; Lv, Z.; Nayak, D.; Kesik-Brodacka, M.; Olsen, S.; Hilgenfeld, R.; Drag, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.273979v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.273979v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,False
72,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are Expressed in the Pancreas but Not in Islet Endocrine Cells,"Summary/AbstractReports of new-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with COVID-19 have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is directly cytotoxic to pancreatic islet {beta} cells. This model would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells via cell surface co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the putative receptor and effector protease, respectively. To define ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the human pancreas, we examined six transcriptional datasets from primary human islet cells and assessed protein expression by immunofluorescence in pancreata from donors with and without diabetes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts were low or undetectable in pancreatic islet endocrine cells as determined by bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and neither protein was detected in  or {beta} cells from any of these donors. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in the islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and also found in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. The absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in islet endocrine cells makes it unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 directly affects pancreatic islet {beta} cells.","Coate, K.

73,ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Expression in the Normal and COVID-19 Pancreas,"Diabetes is associated with increased mortality from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Given literature suggesting a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes induction, we examined pancreatic expression of the key molecule for SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNAseq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated pancreatic expression of ACE2 is prominent in pancreatic ductal epithelium and the microvasculature, with rare endocrine cell expression of this molecule. Pancreata from COVID-19 patients demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein expression primarily limited to ducts. SARS-CoV-2 infection of pancreatic endocrine cells, via ACE2, appears an unlikely central pathogenic feature of COVID-19 as it relates to diabetes.","Kusmartseva, I.; Wu, W.; Syed, F.; van der Heide, V.; Jorgensen, M.; Joseph, P.; Tang, X.; Candelario-Jalil, E.; Yang, C.; Nick, H.; Harbert, J.; Posgai, A.

74,A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses,"There is dire need for an effective and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","Tan, T.

75,Methylene Blue Inhibits In Vitro the SARS-CoV-2 Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction - A Mechanism That Can Contribute to Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19,"Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 M) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","Bojadzic, D.; Alcazar, O.; Buchwald, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,False

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic.

78,Structure-Altering Mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Frame Shifting RNA Element,"With the rapid rate of Covid-19 infections and deaths, treatments and cures besides hand washing, social distancing, masks, isolation, and quarantines are urgently needed. The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, ""RAG"" (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.

SIGNIFICANCESince the outbreak of Covid-19, numerous projects were launched to discover drugs and vaccines. Compared to protein-focused approaches, targeting the RNA genome, especially highly conserved crucial regions, can destruct the virus life cycle more fundamentally and avoid problems of viral mutations. We choose to target the small frame-shifting element (FSE) embedded in the Open Reading Frame 1a,b of SARS-CoV-2. This FSE is essential for translating overlapping reading frames and thus controlling the viral protein synthesis pathway. By applying graph-theory-based computational algorithms, we identify structurally crucial residues in the FSE as potential targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing.","Schlick, T.; Zhu, Q.; Jain, S.; Yan, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1,2020-08-30,2020-08-30,,False
79,Structural classification of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain suggests vaccine and therapeutic strategies,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to ""up"" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only ""up"" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent ""down"" RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, C.

Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease2-4. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities3,5-9. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2.

82,The SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is not essential in vitro or in vivo in humans.,"SARS-CoV-2 genome annotation revealed the presence of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), of which the last one (ORF10) is positioned downstream the N gene. It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is a growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region.

Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was not hampered. Also in vitro, the strains replicated similarly, as the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","Pancer, K.; Milewska, A.; Owczarek, K.; Dabrowska, A.; Branicki, W.; Sanak, M.; Pyrc, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1,2020-08-29,2020-08-29,,False

To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","Antipova, N.

85,Single-cell analysis of human trophoblast stem cell specification reveals activation of fetal cytotrophoblast expression programs including coronavirus associated host factors and human endogenous retroviruses,"The human placenta is increasingly a focus of research related to early child development and the impact of maternal hyperimmune states. The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","Tietze, E.; Barbosa, A. R.; Euclydes, V.; Cho, H.

SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L.

87,Silicon Nitride Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected.

MaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay.

ResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.

ConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","Lehman, C.

88,Plasmablast-derived antibody response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans,"Plasmablast responses and derived IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been analysed in three COVID-19 patients. An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of plasmablast-derived IgG MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. Of thirty-two antibodies specific for the spike glycoprotein, ten recognised the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thirteen were specific for non-RBD epitopes on the S1 subunit, and nine recognised the S2 subunit. A subset of anti-spike antibodies (10 of 32) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested, five targeted the non-RBD S1, and five targeted the S2 subunit. Of the plasmablast-derived MAbs reacting with nucleocapsid, over half of them (19 of 35) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested. The cross-reactive plasmablast-derived antibodies harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified 14 of 32 anti-spike MAbs that neutralised SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays at [&le;] 133 nM (20 g/ml) (five of 10 anti-RBD, three of 13 anti-non-RBD S1 subunit, six of nine anti-S2 subunit). Six of 10 anti-RBD MAbs showed evidence of blockade of ACE2 binding to RBD, and five of six of these were neutralising. Non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies were identified, which offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, K.-Y.

89,Long Period Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Infection of in Vitro Cultured Polarized Human Airway Epithelium,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates throughout human airways. The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 x 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.","Hao, S.; Ning, K.; Kuz, C.

90,A PCR amplicon-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon for antiviral screening,"The development of specific antiviral compounds to SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent task. One of the obstacles for the antiviral development is the requirement of biocontainment because infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be handled in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral screening; however, SARS-CoV-2 replicon has not been reported yet. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3,000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 hours post-electroporation, indicating robust viral translation and RNA replication. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 M, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 M). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral screening without using infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because this is a transient replicon, further improvement including the establishment of stable cell line must be achieved.","Kotaki, T.; Xie, X.; Shi, P.-Y.; Kameoka, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.267567v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.267567v1?rss=1,2020-08-28,2020-08-28,,False
91,A Transferable Deep Learning Approach to Fast Screen Potent Antiviral Drugs against SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic calls for rapid development of effective treatments. Although various drug repurpose approaches have been used to screen the FDA-approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical phases against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes this disease, no magic bullets have been found until now. We used directed message passing neural network to first build a broad-spectrum anti-beta-coronavirus compound prediction model, which gave satisfactory predictions on newly reported active compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Then we applied transfer learning to fine-tune the model with the recently reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. The fine-tuned model was applied to screen a large compound library with 4.9 million drug-like molecules from ZINC15 database and recommended a list of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds for further experimental testing. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested 7 high-scored compounds that also demonstrated good binding strength in docking study against the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 and found one novel compound that inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 37.0 M. Our model is highly efficient and can be used to screen large compound databases with billions or more compounds to accelerate the drug discovery process for the treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, S.; Sun, Q.; Xu, Y.; Pei, J.; Lai, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271569v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271569v1?rss=1,2020-08-28,2020-08-28,,False
92,Comparative study of a 3CLpro inhibitor and remdesivir against both major SARS-CoV-2 clades in human airway models,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that has claimed over 700,000 human lives. The only SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, for emergency use, is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical lead compound with an alternate target, the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in A549+ACE2 cells, using isolates of two major SARS-CoV-2 clades. PF-00835231 is antiviral for both clades, and, in this assay, statistically more potent than remdesivir. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps and validates PF-00835231s time of action. Both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective antiviral for SARS-CoV-2, addresses concerns from non-human in vitro models, and supports further studies with this compound.","de Vries, M.; Mohamed, A.; Prescott, R.

93,A single immunization with spike-functionalized ferritin vaccines elicits neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice,"Development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a public health priority. We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (S{Delta}C-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S{Delta}C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S{Delta}C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","Powell, A.

94,Sequence analysis of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates shows a stronger interaction of mutated receptor binding domain with ACE2 receptor,"SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA Coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human.

Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.

Except three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.

As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, P.; Turuk, J.; Behera, S.

Remarkably 14 of the compounds at 100-M concentration were found to reduce the enzymatic activity and 5 provided IC50 values below 40 M: manidipine (4.8 M), boceprevir (5.4 M), lercanidipine (16.2 M), bedaquiline (18.7 M), and efonidipine (38.5 M).

97,Prunella vulgaris extract and suramin block SARS-coronavirus 2 virus Spike protein D614 and G614 variants mediated receptor association and virus entry in cell culture system,"Until now, no approved effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutic are available for treatment or prevention of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SCoV-2) virus infection. In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ao, Z.; Chan, M.; Ouyang, M.

98,SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage site are generated in vitro during propagation in TMPRSS2-deficient cells,"The spike (S) protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to a host cell receptor which facilitates viral entry. A polybasic motif detected at the cleavage site of the S protein has been shown to broaden the cell tropism and transmissibility of the virus. Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage. Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells. Our study demonstrated that the S protein polybasic cleavage motif is a critical factor underlying SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell tropism. As such, researchers should be alert to the possibility of de novo S gene mutations emerging in tissue-culture propagated virus strains.","Sasaki, M.; Uemura, K.; Sato, A.; Sanaki, T.; Maenaka, K.; Hall, W.
