0,Systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics to model response to antiviral therapies,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 viral loads change rapidly following symptom onset so to assess antivirals it is important to understand the natural history and patient factors influencing this. We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to-date. Methods: This systematic review identified case reports, case series and clinical trial data from publications between 1/1/2020 and 31/5/2020 following PRISMA guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox-PH) of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modelling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time dependent drug effects. Findings: Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month-100 years) with 6316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modelling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, males and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, p<0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, p=0.015; AHR = 6.04, p = 0.006). Interpretation: Combination therapy including interferons should be further investigated. A NLME model for designing and analysing viral pharmacodynamics in trials has been established.","Gastine, S.; Pang, J.; Boshier, F. A. T.; Carter, S. J.; Lonsdale, D. O.; Cortina-Borja, M.; Hung, I.

1,Associations of comorbidities and medications with COVID-19 outcome: A retrospective analysis of real-world evidence data,"Background: Hundreds of thousands of deaths have already been recorded for patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; aka COVID-19). Understanding whether there is a relationship between comorbidities and COVID-19 positivity will not only impact clinical decisions, it will also allow an understanding of how better to define the long-term complications in the groups at risk. In turn informing national policy on who may benefit from more stringent social distancing and shielding strategies. Furthermore, understanding the associations between medications and certain outcomes may also further our understanding of indicators of vulnerability in people with COVID-19 and co-morbidities. Methods: Electronic healthcare records (EHR) from two London hospitals were analysed between 1st January and 27th May 2020. 5294 patients presented to the hospitals in whom COVID status was formally assessed; 1253 were positive for COVID-19 and 4041 were negative. This dataset was analysed to identify associations between comorbidities and medications, separately and two outcomes: (1) presentation with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis, and (2) inpatient death following COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Medications were analysed in different time windows of prescription to differentiate between short-term and long-term medications. All analyses were done with controls (without co-morbidity) matched for age, sex, and number of admissions, and a robustness approach was conducted to only accept results that consistently appear when the analysis is repeated with different proportions of the data. Results: We observed higher COVID-19 positive presentation for patients with hypertension (1.7 [1.3-2.1]) and diabetes (1.6 [1.2-2.1]). We observed higher inpatient COVID-19 mortality for patients with hypertension (odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.9-3.9]), diabetes (2.2 [1.4-3.5]), congestive heart failure (3.1 [1.5-6.4]), and renal disease (2.6 [1.4-5.1]). We also observed an association with reduced COVID-19 mortality for diabetic patients for whom anticoagulants (0.11 [0.03-0.50]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.04-0.58]), penicillins (0.20 [0.06-0.63]), or biguanides (0.19 [0.05-0.70]) were administered within 21 days after their positive COVID-19 test with no evidence that they were on them before, and for hypertensive patients for whom anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02-0.35]), antiplatelet drugs (0.10 [0.02-0.59]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.05-0.46]), penicillins (0.14 [0.05-0.45]), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (0.06 [0.01-0.53]) were administered within 21 days post-COVID-19-positive testing with no evidence that they were on them before. Moreover, long-term antidiabetic drugs were associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality in diabetic patients (0.26 [0.10-0.67]). Conclusions: We provided real-world evidence for observed associations between COVID-19 outcomes and a number of comorbidities and medications. These results require further investigation and replication in other data sets.","Abu-Jamous, B.; Anisimovich, A.; Baxter, J.; Mackillop, L.; Vizcaychipi, M. P.; McCarthy, A.; Khan, R.

2,Forecasting PPE Consumption during a Pandemic: The Case of Covid-19,"Due to the global shortage of PPE caused by increasing number of COVID-19 patients in recent months, many hospitals have had difficulty procuring adequate PPE for the clinicians who care for these patients. Faced with a shortage, hospitals have had to implement new PPE conservation policies. In this paper, we describe a tool to help hospitals better project PPE needs under various conservation policies. Though this tool is built on top of projections of the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is agnostic as to which model--of which many are available--provides these projections. The tool combines COVID-19 patient census projections with information like staffing ratios and frequency of patient contact to provide projections of the number of items of key types of PPE needed under three built-in conservation scenarios: standard, contingency, and crisis. Users are also able to customize the tool to the specifics of their hospital and design custom conservation policies.","Lum, K.; Johndrow, J.; Cardone, A.; Fuchs, B.; Cotner, C.; Jew, O.; Parikh, R.; Draugelis, M.; Luong, T.; Hanish, A.; Weissman, G.

4,The active lung microbiota landscape of COVID-19 patients,"With the outbreak of COVID-19 causing by SARS-CoV-2, the interaction between the host and SARS-CoV-2 was widely studied. However, it is unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects lung microflora, which contributes to COVID-19 complications. Here, we analyzed the metatranscriptomic data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 19 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy controls from 6 independent projects and detailed the active microbiota landscape in both healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 could deeply change the lung microbiota, evidenced by the -diversity, {beta}-diversity and species composition analysis based on bacterial microbiota and virome. Pathogens (such as Klebsiella oxytoca causing pneumonia as well), immunomodulatory probiotics (such as Lactic Acid Bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a butyrate producer) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were enriched in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a severe microbiota dysbiosis. The significant correlation between Rothia mucilaginosa, TMV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed drastic inflammatory battles between the host, SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in the lungs. Notably, TMV only existed in the COVID-19 group, while Human respirovirus 3 only existed in the healthy group. Our study provides insight into the active microbiota in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and will contribute to the understanding of the infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of the disease and complications.","Han, Y.; Jia, Z.; Shi, J.; Wang, W.; He, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20144014v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20144014v1?rss=1,2020-08-23,2020-08-23,,True
5,Impact of Duration of Cessation of Mass BCG Vaccination Programs on Covid -19 Mortality,"Back ground: BCG have heterogeneous immunity to certain pathogens other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis effect. At early times during COVID-19 pandemic heterogeneous immunity towards (SARS-CoV-2), was hypothesized and statistical correlation between of BCG vaccination practices and COVID-19 mortality variances among countries was statistically proved . These studies was criticized because of low evidence of such studies and possible confounding factors. For that reason this study was designed to look for impact of duration of cessation of BCG programs on Covid-19 mortality looking for the hypotheses by different design and looking forward to support previous studies. Methods: Total number of studied group is 14 countries which has stopped BCG vaccination programs. Through applying stem-leaf plot for exploring data screening behavior concerning Covid-19 Mortality for obsolescence duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs, as well as (nonlinear regression of compound model) for predicted shape behavior for that group. Results: Slope value shows highly significant effectiveness of obsolescence of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs on Covid -19 mortality at P-value<0.000. Obsolescence of duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs has strongly negatively associated with Covid-19 mortality in countries which stopped BCG vaccination programs. Conclusion: The longer the cessation duration of BCG programs, the higher the Covid-19 mortality is, and vice versa.","Raham, T.

7,COVID-19 Risk Perception Among U.S. Adults: Changes from February to May 2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to detrimentally impact the United States. Using a survey, we collected demographic and COVID-19 risk perception, behavior, knowledge, and attitude data from 672 adults across the U.S. in May 2020. These variables were compared with the results from a survey in February 2020. Participants who were older (55+ years; M = 6.3, SD = 2.0), identified as Native American/Alaska Native (M = 6.8, SD = 1.0) or Asian (M = 6.0, SD = 2.0), and those who had contracted (M = 6.8, SD = 2.0) or knew someone who had contracted COVID-19 (M = 6.2, SD = 1.7) reported higher perceived risk. Health behaviors, such as physical distancing, have shown to impact infectious disease trajectories. As the U.S. reopens its economy, public health officials and politicians must formulate culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging and policies, based on the public's COVID-19 risk perceptions, to encourage preventive behaviors.","Malik, A.

8,Poor knowledge of COVID-19 and unfavourable perception of the response to the pandemic by healthcare workers at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (West Region - Cameroon),"Background The World Health Organization has warned against a dramatic impact of COVID'19 in subSaharan Africa unless adequate response strategies are implemented. Whatever the strategy, the role of health care workers is pivotal. We undertook this study to assess knowledge of COVID'19 and perception of the response to the pandemic among the staff of a regional hospital in charge of COVID'19 patients in West Cameroon. Methods We used a convenience non probabilistic sampling method to carry out a survey with a self administered questionnaire from April 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020 at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (BRH). All the staff was invited to participate. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Epi Info version 7.1.5.2 software. Results Response rate was 76.1% (464/610). Mean age (SD) and average work experience (SD) were 35.0 (8.9) and 8.4 (7.4) years respectively. Sex ratio (M/F) was 101/356. Nursing and midwifery staff (56.8%) and in patients units (49.94%) were predominant. Knowledge on origin and transmission of SARS'CoV'2 was poor but knowledge of clinical signs and the role of laboratory tests were good. 53.2% of respondents said all therapeutic regimens are only supportive and only a third of them trusted drugs recommended by health authorities. For 36.9% of respondents, herbal remedies can prevent/cure COVID'19. 70% of staffs felt they were not knowledgeable enough to handle COVID'19 cases. 85.6% of respondents thought the BRH had insufficient resources to adequately respond to COVID'19 and 55.6% were dissatisfied with its response to the pandemic (weaknesses: medicines/technologies (74.5%), service delivery (28.1%), human resource (10.9%)). 68% of staff felt insufficiently protected on duty and 76.5% reported that the pandemic significantly reduced non-COVID-19 services. 85.5% said they complied with preventive measures while in the community. For 44% of respondents Cameroonian regulations on COVID'19 corpses should be made more culture sensitive. 51.2% of respondents were against vaccine trial in their community.

9,COVID-19 in a cohort of pregnant women and their descendants. Cohort profile in the MOACC-19 study,"Consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their descendants are not well known. The Mother and Child Covid-19 study is a cohort recruiting about 1000 pregnant women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary results as recruitment is still open. Three sub-cohorts can be identified at recruitment. Sub-cohort 1 includes women giving birth between 23rd March and 25th May 2020; they have been retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their third trimester of pregnancy. Sub-cohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26th May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Sub-cohort 3 includes women in their 12th week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26th May 2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a naso-pharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis. Children will be followed-up for one year in order to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development. As of 29th July, 477 women have been recruited (212, 132 and 133 for sub-cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Eight women tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Seven children were born from these women and all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Summarizing, we are recruiting a cohort of 1000 pregnant women and their neonates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results so far show that few women were infected at delivery and no child have been affected.","Llorca, J.; Lechosa-Muniz, C.; Gortazar, P.; Fernandez-Ortiz, M.; Jubete, Y.; Cabero-Perez, M.

10,Dynamic causal modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Italy predicts possible scenarios for the second wave,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as ""Dynamic Causal Modeling"" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides - through Bayesian model inversion and inference - estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model - parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase - was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.","Gandolfi, D.; Pagnoni, G.; Filippini, T.; Goffi, A.; Vinceti, M.; D'Angelo, E.

11,Evaluating aerosol and splatter during orthodontic debonding: implications for the COVID-19 pandemic,"Introduction: Dental procedures often produce splatter and aerosol which have potential to spread pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Mixed guidance exists on the aerosol generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate aerosol and/or splatter contamination during an orthodontic debonding procedure. Material and Methods: Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was carried out in triplicate with filter papers placed in the immediate environment. Composite bonding cement was removed using a slow-speed handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis. Results: Contamination across the 8-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. There was contamination of the operator, assistant, and mannequin, representing 8%, 25%, and 28% of the positive control spectrofluorometric measurements, respectively. Discussion: Orthodontic debonding produces splatter within the immediate locality of the patient. Widespread aerosol generation was not observed. Conclusions: Orthodontic debonding procedures are low risk for aerosol generation, but localised splatter is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant, and patient.","Llandro, H.; Allison, J.; Currie, C.; Edwards, D.; Bowes, C.; Durham, J.; Jakubovics, N.; Rostami, N.; Holliday, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178319v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178319v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
12,Whether Early Pulse Steroid dose is associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 critically ill Patients- A retrospective Chart Review,"Abstract : Introduction: Steroids have theoretically seems useful in critically ill patients of COVID-19 . However the time of starting steroid and dose remains a matter of concern due to still emerging evidences and wide-ranging concerns of benefits and harms. We did a retrospective record analysis in an apex teaching hospital ICU setting to explore this concern. Methodology: 45 adults age more than 18 years with nasopharyngeal swab PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with ARDS admitted to ICU in between 20th March,2020 to 15th July 2020 were included in chart review. We did a bivariate analysis of age ,comorbidity, infections, severity of disease , timing /dose(appropriate) steroid and presence of infection on survival. In the next step we performed a Bayesian Exact regression to understand the adjusted effect of early appropriate steroid on survival in the presence of age and infections as probable confounder. Results: Bivariate analysis showed the statistically significant effect of age <60 years and steroid dose (early and classified by disease severity) had a favourable effect on outcome. Further Early Pulse Steroid (EPS ) amongst the more severe subgroup was found to be significantly associated with better survival. Conclusion: High dose steroids (more than 500 mg MPS) if given early in the course of disease to COVID19 critically ill patients (P/F<150) can significantly reduce mortality and are not associated with increased infections.","Goyal, A.; saigal, s.; Joshi, A.; Niwariya, Y.; Brahmam, D.; Khurana, A.; Singh, P.; Sharma, J.; Karna, S.

13,"Lockdown, relaxation, and ACME period in COVID-19: A study of disease dynamics on Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico","Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. At the request of Sonoran Health Ministry, we developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. For this purpose, a Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early ACME around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, in respect of relaxation dynamics, the ACME levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities or the individual behavior regarding prevention measures. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the ACME occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave.","Tocto-Erazo, M.; Espindola-Zepeda, J.

14,Absence of relevant QT interval prolongation in not critically ill COVID-19 patients.,"Objectives. SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly evolving pandemic causing great morbimortality. Medical therapy with hydroxicloroquine, azitromycin and protease inhibitors is being empirically used, with reported data of QTc interval prolongation. Our aim is to assess QT interval behaviour in a not critically ill and not monitored cohort of patients. Design. We evaluated admitted and ambulatory patients with COVID-19 patients with 12 lead electrocardiogram at 48 hours after treatment initiation. Other clinical and analytical variables were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of the QT interval prolongation under treatment and to identify clinical, analytical and electrocardiographic risk markers of QT prolongation independent predictors. Results. We included 219 patients (mean age of 63.6 +/- 17.4 years, 48.9% were women and 16.4% were outpatients. The median baseline QTc was 416 ms (IQR 404-433), and after treatment QTc was prolonged to 423 ms (405-438) (P < 0.001), with an average increase of 1.8%. Most of the patients presented a normal QTc under treatment, with only 31 cases (14,1 %) showing a QTc interval > 460 ms, and just one case with QTc > 500 ms. Advanced age, longer QTc basal at the basal ECG and lower potassium levels were independent predictors of QTc interval prolongation. Conclusions.

15,A delayed SEIQR epidemic model of COVID-19 in Tokyo,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine is needed. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine, and to suggest a guideline for the measure. The latency period (compartment E) was assumed to be 3 days, and the start of quarantine action was assumed to be delayed by 4 to 10 days from infection. The actual PCR test-positive number data from March 10th to July 18th in 2020 was analyzed to estimate a transmission rate and the basic reproduction number. The area where the infection expansion is restrained was displayed in the two parameter space (transmission rate and quarantine rate) for several possible lengths of the delay of quarantine. As a result, it was shown to be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by a simple quarantine action retaining the delay. As a short term measure, it was found to be necessary to reduce the transmission rate through some kind of restriction of social activity, but as a long term measure, it was found to be possible to maintain the social activity by shortening the delay of quarantine through expanding the infection test system to find earlier stage patients, including asymptomatic infectious patients. In order to shed light to this conclusion from a different viewpoint, this model was applied in another case that an additional quarantine was taken into account before the delay. The result was shown to have a similar effect as that of the shortening of the delay.","Maki, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
16,COVID19 epidemic growth rates have declined since early March in U.S. regions with active hospitalized case surveillance,"Introduction Optimal pandemic monitoring and management requires unbiased and regionally specific estimates of disease incidence and epidemic growth. Methods I estimated growth rates and doubling times across a 22-week period of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic using hospital admissions incidence data collected through the US CDC COVID-NET surveillance program which operates in 98 U.S. counties located in 13 states. I cross validated the growth measures using mortality incidence data for the same regions and time periods. Results Between March 1 and August 8, 2020, two distinct waves of epidemic activity occurred. During the first wave in the COVID-NET monitoring regions, the harmonic mean of the maximum weekly growth rate was 534% (Median: 575; Range: 250 to 2250) and this maximum occurred in the second or third week of March in different regions. The harmonic mean of the minimum doubling time occurred with maximum growth rate and was 0.35 weeks (Median 0.36 weeks; Range: 0.22 to 0.55 weeks). The harmonic mean of the maximum incidence rate during the first wave of the epidemic was 8.5 hospital admissions per 100,000 people per week (Median: 9.2, Range: 4 to 40.5) and the peak of epidemic infection transmission associated with this maximum occurred on or before March 27, 2020 in eight of the 13 regions. Dividing the 22-week observed period into four intervals, the harmonic mean of the weekly hospitalization incidence rate was highest during the second interval (4.6 hospitalizations per week per 100,000), then fell during the third and fourth intervals. Growth rates declined from 101 percent per week in the first interval to 2.5 percent per week in the last. Doubling time have lengthened from 3/5th of a week in the first interval to 12.5 weeks in the last. Period by period, the cumulative incidence has grown primarily in a linear mode. The mean cumulative incidence of hospitalizations on Aug 8th, 2020 in the COVID-NET regions is 96 hospitalizations per 100,000. Regions which experienced the highest maximum weekly incidence rates or greatest cumulative incidence rates in the first wave, generally, but not uniformly, observed the lower incidence rates in the second wave. Growth measures calculated based on mortality incidence data corroborate these findings. Conclusions Declining epidemic growth rates of SARS-COV-2 infection appeared in early March in the first observations of nationwide hospital admissions surveillance program in multiple U.S. regions. A sizable fraction of the U.S. population may have been infected in a cryptic February epidemic acceleration phase. To more accurately monitor epidemic trends and inform pandemic mitigation planning going forward, the US CDC needs measures of epidemic disease incidence that better reflect clinical disease and account for large variations in case ascertainment strategies over time.","Bhatia, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178228v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178228v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
17,"Potential interruptions in HIV prevention and treatment services for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men associated with COVID-19","Background Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has necessitated a range of population-based measures in order to stem the spread of infection and reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. These measures may be associated with disruptions to other health services including for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) at risk for or living with HIV. Here, we assess the relationship between stringency of COVID-19 mitigation strategies and interruptions to HIV prevention and treatment services for MSM. Methods Data for this study were collected as part of a COVID-19 Disparities Survey implemented by the gay social networking app Hornet, with data collected between April 16th, 2020 and May 24th, 2020. Data were assessed for countries where at least 50 participants completed the survey, to best evaluate country-level heterogeneity. We used a modified Poisson regression model, with clustering at the country-level, to assess the association between stringency of pandemic control measures and access to HIV services. Pandemic control measures were quantified using the Oxford Government Response Tracker Stringency Index; each country received a score (0-100) based on the number and strictness of nine indicators related to school and workplace closures and travel bans. Results A total of 10,654 MSM across 20 countries were included in these analyses. The mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation: 10.8), and 12% (1264/10540) of participants reported living with HIV. The median stringency score was 82.31 (Range:[19.44, Belarus]-[92.59, Ukraine]). For every ten-point increase in stringency, there was a 3% reduction in the prevalence of access to in-person testing (aPR: 0.97, 95% CI:[0.96, 0.98]), a 6% reduction in the prevalence of access to self-testing (aPR: 0.94, 95% CI:[0.93, 0.95]), and a 5% reduction in access to PrEP (aPR: 0.95, 95% CI:[0.95, 0.97]). Among those living with HIV, close to one in five (n=218/1105) participants reported being unable to access their provider either in-person or via telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a greater proportion of interruptions to treatment services reported in Belarus and Mexico. Almost half (n=820/1254) reported being unable to refill their HIV medicine prescription remotely. Conclusions More stringent government responses were associated with decreased access to HIV diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services. To minimize increases in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, innovative strategies are needed to facilitate minimize service interruptions to MSM communities during this and potential future waves of COVID-19.","Rao, A.; Rucinski, K.; Jarrett, B.; Ackerman, B.; Wallach, S.; Marcus, J.; Adamson, T.; Garner, A.; Santos, G.-M.; Beyrer, C.; Howell, S.; Baral, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178285v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178285v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
18,Seroprevalence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Among Health Care Workers from Three Pandemic Hospitals of Turkey,"COVID-19 is a global threat with an increasing number of infections. Research on IgG seroprevalence among health care workers (HCWs) is needed to re-evaluate health policies. This study was performed in three pandemic hospitals in Istanbul and Kocaeli. Different clusters of HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity rate among participants was evaluated by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. We recruited 813 non-infected and 119 PCR-confirmed infected HCWs. Of the previously undiagnosed HCWs, 22 (2.7%) were seropositive. Seropositivity rates were highest for cleaning staff (6%), physicians (4%), nurses (2.2%) and radiology technicians (1%). Non-pandemic clinic (6.4%) and ICU (4.3%) had the highest prevalence. HCWs in high risk group had similar seropositivity rate with no risk group (2.9 vs 3.6 p=0.7), indicating the efficient implementation of protection measures in the hospitals in Turkey. These findings might lead to the re-evaluation of infection control and transmission dynamics in hospitals.","ALKURT, G.; MURT, A.; AYDIN, Z.; TATLI, O.; AGAOGLU, N.

19,Disparities in COVID-19 Hospitalizations and Mortality among Black and Hispanic Patients: Cross-Sectional Analysis from the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area,"Disparate racial and ethnic burdens of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be attributable to higher susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or to factors such as differences in hospitalization and care provision. In our cross-sectional analysis of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases from a tertiary, eight-hospital healthcare system (Houston Methodist) across greater Houston, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the odds of hospitalization and mortality for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) vs. non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics. Between March 3rd and July 18th, 2020, 70,496 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 12,084 (17.1%) tested positive, of whom 3,536 (29.3%) were hospitalized. Among positive cases, NHBs and Hispanics were significantly younger than NHWs and Hispanics, respectively (mean age NHBs vs. NHWs: 46.0 vs. 51.7 year and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 44.0 vs. 48.7 years). Despite younger age, NHBs (vs. NHWs) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (25.2%), hypertension (47.7%), and chronic kidney disease (5.0%). Both minority groups resided in lower median income and higher population density areas. In fully adjusted models, NHBs and Hispanics had higher likelihoods of hospitalization, aOR (CI): 1.42 (1.24-1.63) and 1.61 (1.46-1.78), respectively. No differences were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization or treatment parameters. Models adjusted for demographics, vital signs, laboratory parameters, hospital complications, and ICU admission demonstrated non-significantly lower likelihoods of in-hospital mortality among NHBs and Hispanics, aOR (CI): 0.65 (0.40-1.03) and 0.89 (0.59-1.31), respectively. Our data did not demonstrate racial and ethnic differences in care provision and hospital outcomes. Higher susceptibility of racial and ethnic minorities to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent hospitalization may be driven primarily by social determinants.","Pan, A.; Khan, O.; Meeks, J.; Boom, M.; Masud, F.; Andrieni, J.; Phillips, R.; Tiruneh, Y.; Kash, B.; Vahidy, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20177956v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20177956v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
20,"Epidemic Analysis of COVID-19 in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia using the Generalized SEIR Model","Background. Since its emergence in late December 2019 and its declaration as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease known as (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. The process of modeling and predicting the pandemic behavior became crucial as the different states needed accurate predictions to be able to adopt suitable policies to minimize the pressure on their health care systems. Researchers have employed modified variants of classical SIR/SEIR models to describe the dynamics of this pandemic. In this paper, after proven effective in numerous countries, a modified variant of SEIR is implemented to predict the behavior of COVID-19 in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East. Methods. We built MATLAB simulations to fit the real data of COVID-19 Active, recovered and death Cases in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to the modified SEIR model via Nelder-Mead algorithm to be able to estimate the future dynamics of the pandemic. Findings. We estimate several characteristics of COVID-19 future dynamics in Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. We also estimate that the pandemic will resolve in the countries under investigation in February 2021, January 2021 and 28th August 2020 with total death cases of 9,742, 5,600 and 185 and total cases of 187,600, 490,000 and 120,000 respectively.","Fahmy, A.

21,Ensemble Forecasts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S.,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has driven demand for forecasts to guide policy and planning. Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single ""ensemble"" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths. Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons. Careful development, assessment, and communication of ensemble forecasts can provide reliable insight to public health decision makers.","Ray, E. L.; Wattanachit, N.; Niemi, J.; Kanji, A.

22,The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike is the key target of neutralizing antibody in human polyclonal sera.,"Natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans leads to the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response, however the immunodominant targets of the polyclonal neutralizing antibody response are still unknown. Here, we functionally define the role SARS-CoV-2 spike plays as a target of the human neutralizing antibody response. In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response.

The protective efficiency of it was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256.

25,Ferrets not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-exposure domestic setting,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic COVID-19. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the household ferret population via RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein mutations associated with mustelids. While there is evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data suggest that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site are a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection.","Sawatzki, K.; Hill, N.

27,"Healthcare workers knowledge, attitude and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic response in a tertiary care hospital of Nepal","Background To control the spread of ongoing COVID-19 infection, extremely important measures need to be adopted. Healthcare workers adherence to prevention and control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we assessed the KAP among healthcare workers towards COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Method A self-developed piloted KAP questionnaire was used among the recruited healthcare workers working for the COVID-19 response in the Universal College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UCMSTH), in Bhairahawa, Nepal. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the clinical characteristics, prevention and management of COVID-19. Assessment on attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on behaviour and change in practices while working during this response. Knowledge scores were calculated and compared by demographic characteristics and their attitude and practices towards COVID-19. Data were analysed using bivariate statistics. Results A total of 103 healthcare workers participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 28.24(6.11) years (range: 20-56); 60.2% were females; 61.2% were unmarried; 60.2% had medical degree and 39.8% were nursing staff. The mean knowledge score was 10.59(1.12) (range: 7-13) and it did not vary by demographic characteristics. Attitude was positive for 53.4% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.35(1.19) and negative for 46.6% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.88(0.98) (p=0.02).

28,3D Printed Snorkel Mask Adapter for Failed N95 Fit Tests and PPE Shortages,"Introduction The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country has been widely discussed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept.   Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","Dalla, S.; Shinde, R.; Ayres, J.

29,"Genetically-predicted vitamin D status, ambient UVB during the pandemic and COVID-19 risk in UK Biobank: Mendelian Randomisation study","A growing body of evidence shows that poor vitamin D status has been associated with an increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial respiratory infections. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes, and to explore potential causal effects. We used logistic regression to identify associations between different vitamin D variables (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (25-OHD), ambient UVB and genetically-predicted 25-OHD concentrations) and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 495,780 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to test if there was any causal effect. In total, 1,746 COVID-19 cases and 399 COVID-19 deaths occurred between March and June 2020. We found significant inverse associations between COVID-19 infection and 25-OHD in univariable models, but these associations were non-significant after adjustment for confounders. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with hospitalization and death. Although the main MR analysis showed that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels were not causally associated with COVID-19 risk, MR sensitivity analysis using weighted mode method indicated a potential causal effect (OR=0.72, 95% CI:0.53-0.98; P=0.041). In conclusion, our study found suggestive evidence of association between vitamin D and the risk or severity of COVID-19 but further studies are needed.","Li, X.; Geffen, J. v.; Weele, M. v.; Meng, X.; ZHANG, X.; He, Y.; Timofeeva, M.; Campbell, H.; Dunlop, M.

30,Comparison Between Influenza and COVID-19 at a Tertiary Care Center,"ABSTRACT Background: Widespread reports suggest the characteristics and disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza differ, yet detailed comparisons of their clinical manifestations are lacking. Objective: Comparison of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with those of influenza patients in previous seasons at the same hospital Design: Admission rates, clinical measurements, and clinical outcomes from confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 1 and April 30, 2020 were compared with those from confirmed influenza cases in the previous five influenza seasons (8 months each) beginning September 1, 2014. Setting: Large tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts Participants: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza inpatients Measurements: Patient demographics and medical history, mortality, incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation, incidences of vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy, hospital and intensive care admissions. Results: Data was abstracted from medical records of 1052 influenza patients and 583 COVID-19 patients. An average of 210 hospital admissions for influenza occurred per 8-month season compared to 583 COVID-19 admissions over two months. The median weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 17 (IQR: 4, 34) compared to a weekly median of 1 (IQR: 0, 2) influenza patient (p=0.001). COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31% vs 8%), and had significantly higher mortality (20% vs. 3%; p<0.001 for all). Relatively more COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation lacked pre-existing conditions compared with mechanically ventilated influenza patients (25% vs 4%, p<0.001). Limitation: This is a single-center study which could limit generalization. Conclusion: COVID-19 resulted in more hospitalizations, higher morbidity, and higher mortality than influenza at the same hospital.","Donnino, M. W.; Moskowitz, A.; Thompson, G. S.; Heydrick, S.

31,Machine learning based clinical decision supportsystem for early COVID-19 mortality prediction,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public medical systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors of mortality that yield high accuracy and consistency to optimize patient treatment strategy. This study uses machine learning methods to identify a powerful combination of five features that help predict mortality with 96% accuracy: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and age. Various machine learning algorithms have been compared to achieve a consistent high accuracy across the days that span the disease. Robust testing with three cases confirm the strong predictive performance of the proposed model. The model predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. This study would help accelerate the decision making process in healthcare systems for focused medical treatments early and accurately.","Karthikeyan, A.; Garg, A.; Vinod, P. K.; Priyakumar, U.

32,A clinical MALDI-ToF Mass spectrometry assay for SARS-CoV-2: Rational design and multi-disciplinary team work.,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus has stretched national testing capacities to breaking points in almost all countries of the world. The need to rapidly screen vast numbers of a countrys population in order to control the spread of the infection is paramount. However, the logistical requirement for reagent supply (and associated cost) of RT-PCR based testing (the current front-line test) have been hugely problematic. Mass spectrometry-based methods using swab and gargle samples have been reported with promise, but have not approached the task from a systematic analysis of the entire diagnostic process. Here, the pipeline from sample processing, the biological characteristics of the pathogen in human biofluid, the downstream bio- and physical-chemistry and the all-important data processing with clinical interpretation and reporting, are carefully compiled into a single high throughput and reproducible rapid process. Utilizing MALDI-ToF mass spectrometric detection to viral envelope glycoproteins in a systems biology - multidisciplinary team approach, we have achieved a multifaceted clinical MALDI ToF MS screening test, primarily (but not limited to) SARS-CoV-2, with direct applicable to other future epidemics/pandemics that may arise. The clinical information generated not only includes SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus detection (Spike protein fragments S1, S2b, S2a peaks), but other respiratory viral infections detected as well as an assessment of generalised oral upper respiratory immune response (elevated total Ig light chain peak) and a measure of the viral immune response (elevated intensity of IgA heavy chain peak). The advantages of the method include; 1) ease of sampling, 2) speed of analysis, and much reduced cost of testing. These features reveal the diagnostic utility of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as a powerful and economically attractive global solution.","Iles, R. K.; Zmuidinaite, R.; Iles, J.

33,COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness in a United Kingdom Tertiary and Quaternary Children`s Hospital: Tales of the Unexpected,"Background: The paucity of data describing SARS-CoV-2 in the paediatric population necessitated a broad-arching approach to pandemic planning, with preparations put in place to manage a heterogeneous cohort. We describe a diverse group of SARS-CoV-2 positive paediatric patients treated at a large tertiary/quaternary children`s hospital in the United Kingdom and the adaptive coping strategies required. Methods: All paediatric patients with positive RT-PCR on a respiratory sample and/or serology for SARS-CoV-2 up to 19th May 2020 were included. Results: 57 children met the inclusion criteria. 70% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity with a median age of 9.3 years (IQR 5.16-13.48). Four distinct groups were identified: paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) (54%), primary respiratory (18%), incidental (7%), and non-specific febrile illnesses with or without extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction (21%). These groups presented in distinct chronological blocks as the pandemic unfolded. Discussion: The diverse range of presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population exemplified the importance of preparedness for the unknown in the midst of a novel infectious pandemic. Descriptions of paediatric patients during the initial phase of the pandemic from other parts of the globe and extrapolation from adult data did not serve as an accurate representation of paediatric COVID-19 in our centre. An adaptive, multidisciplinary approach was paramount. Expanded laboratory testing and incorporation of technology platforms to facilitate remote collaboration in response to strict infection control precautions were both indispensable. Lessons learned during the preparation process will be essential in planning for a potential second wave of SARS-CoV-2.","Alders, N.; Penner, J.; Grant, K.; Patterson, C.; Hassell, J.; MacDermott, N.; Pincott, S.; Bamford, A.; du Pre, P.; Johnson, M.; Moshal, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178541v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178541v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
34,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Diabetic COVID-19 patients in Kuwait,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and rapidly turned into a global pandemic, resulting in what is now known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 has a highly variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory symptoms and death. Diabetes seems to be one of the main comorbidities contributing to a worse COVID-19 outcome. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective study of 417 consecutive COVID-19 patients in Kuwait, we analyze and compare disease severity, outcome, associated complications, and clinical laboratory findings between diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Results: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as hypertension, higher levels of inflammatory markers, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a higher incidence of complications. All of these factors could lead to more severe outcomes and higher mortality than non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Diabetes could be a major contributor to COVID-19 worsening outcomes.","Ali, H.; Alshukry, A.; Bu Abbas, M.; Ali, Y.; Alahmad, B.; Al-Shammari, A.

35,Inhaled corticosteroids downregulate SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression in COPD: results from a RCT,"Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for the prevention of acute exacerbations in people with COPD, but their use is associated with increased risk of respiratory infections. The effects of ICS on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity are currently unknown. Objectives: To determine the effects of ICS treatment on the bronchial epithelial cell expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in volunteers with COPD. Methods: We performed a randomized, open-label, parallel treatment trial of 12 weeks treatment with ICS in combination with long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol/budesonide 12/400 g twice daily or salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 25/250 g twice daily), or treatment with LABA only (formoterol 12 g twice daily), in volunteers with mild to very severe COPD. We obtained bronchial epithelial cell samples via bronchoscopy before and after treatment, and determined transcriptome-wide gene expression by RNA sequencing. Main Results: 63 volunteers were randomized to receive treatment. Compared to formoterol alone, formoterol/budesonide treatment decreased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 and the host cell protease gene ADAM17. These genes were highly co-expressed with innate immune response genes, particularly those of the type I interferon and anti-viral response pathways, which also tended to decrease following ICS treatment. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that ICS affect the expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in COPD. Their relation to important anti-viral response genes may have critical implications for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity in this vulnerable population.","Milne, S.; Li, X.; Yang, C.

36,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Positive Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients; a multisource Electronic Healthcare Records Study from England,"Background: Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. However, there is limited information on management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant COVID19 infection. Objectives: This multisource national analysis of live data from England was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with ACS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: Multisource data from all acute NHS hospital in England was linked to study the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 ACS compared to non COVID-19 ACS patients. Hierarchical multilevel models were constructed to study the association between COVID19 ACS and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Results: Between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020, 517 (4.0%) were admitted with COVID- 19 ACS from a total of 12,958 ACS patients. COVID-19 ACS patients were generally older, BAME ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting characteristics compared to non-COVID-19 ACS patients. They were less likely to receive invasive coronary strategy in the form of coronary angiography (67.7% vs 81.0%), PCI (30.2% vs 53.9%), dual antiplatelet medication 76.3% vs 88.0%), and other important secondary medication. Patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (aOR 3.27 95%CI 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to non COVID-19 ACS group. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is prevalent but less frequent in the patients hospitalized with ACS in England.

37,Development of antibodies to pan-coronavirus spike peptides in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"Coronaviruses are sharing several protein regions notable the spike protein (S) on their enveloped membrane surface, with the S1 subunit recognizing and binding to the cellular receptor, while the S2 subunit mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion. This similarity opens the question whether infection with one coronavirus will confer resistance to other coronaviruses? Investigating patient serum samples after SARS-CoV-2 infection in cross-reactivity studies of immunogenic peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we were able to detect the production of antibodies also recognizing MERS virus antigens. The cross-reactive peptide comes from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS virus spike protein. Indeed, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein, previously proven to induce antibodies against MERS-CoV is sharing 74% homology with the corresponding sequence of SARS-CoV-19 virus. Sera samples of 47 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, validated by RT-PCR-negative testes 30 days post-infection, and samples of 40 sera of control patients (not infected with SARS-CoV-2 previously) were used to establish eventual cross-bind reactivity with the MERS peptide antigen. Significantly stronger binding (p<0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to the control group. If used as an antigen, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein allows discrimination between post-Covid populations from non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection has the ability to recognize and probably decrease infectiveness of MERS-CoV infections as well as other coronaviruses. The high homology of the spike protein domain suggests in addition that the opposite effect can also be true: coronaviral infections producing cross-reactive antibodies affective against SARS-CoV-19. The collected data prove in addition that despite the core HR2 region being hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections.","Rabets, A.; Bila, G.; Grytsko, R.; Samborsky, M.; Rebets, Y.; Vari, S.; Pagneux, Q.; Barras, A.; Boukherroub, R.; Szunerits, S.; Bilyy, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178566v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178566v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
38,Engagement and adherence trade-offs for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing,"Contact tracing is an important tool for allowing countries to ease lockdown policies introduced to combat SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked. However, policies such as legal enforcement of self-isolation can create trade-offs by dissuading individuals from self-reporting. We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritised. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme. We find that policies that increase the verage duration of self-isolation, or that increase the probability that people self-isolate at all, at the expense of reduced self-reporting rate, will not decrease the risk of a large outbreak and may increase the risk, depending on the strength of the trade-off. These results suggest that policies to increase self-isolation adherence should be implemented carefully. Policies that increase self-isolation adherence at the cost of self-reporting rates should be avoided.","Lucas, T. C. D.; Davis, E.

39,Effects of (Un)lockdown on COVID-19 transmission: A mathematical study of different phases in India,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of the December 2019 is causing a potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), has meanwhile led to outbreak all over the globe. India has now become the third worst hit country globally with 16,38,870 confirmed cases and 35,747 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 as of 31 July 2020. In this paper we have used mathematical modelling approach to study the effects of lockdowns and un-lockdowns on the pandemic evolution in India. This, study is based on SIDHARTHE model, which is an extension of classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The SIDHARTHE model distinguish between the diagnosed and undiagnosed cases, which is very important because undiagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the virus than diagnosed individuals. We have stratified the lockdowns and un-lockdowns into seven phases and have computed the basic reproduction number R0 for each phase. We have calibrated our model results with real data from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Our results demonstrate that different strategies implemented by GoI, have delayed the peak of pandemic by approximately 100 days.

40,Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients with Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Global Data,"Background Data on the prevalence of cancer in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients and the severe illness incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients with cancers remains unclear. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from database inception to July 15, 2020, for studies of patients with COVID-19 infection that had available comorbidity information on cancer. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients and the secondary endpoint was the outcomes of COVID-19-infected cancer patients with incidence of severe illness and death rate. We calculated the pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using a random-effects model, and performed meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on continent, country, age, sample size and study design. Findings A total of 107 eligible global studies were included in the systematic review. 90 studies with 94,845 COVID-19 patients in which 4,106 patients with cancer morbidity were included in the meta-analysis for prevalence of cancer morbidity among COVID-19 patients. 21 studies with 70,969 COVID-19 patients in which 3,351 patients with cancer morbidity who had severe illness or death during the studies. The overall prevalence of cancer among the COVID-19 patients was 0.07 (95% CI 0.05~0.09). The cancer prevalence in COVID-19 patients of Europe (0.22, 95% CI 0.17~0.28) was higher than that in Asia Pacific (0.04, 95% CI 0.03~0.06) and North America (0.05, 95% CI 0.04~0.06). The prevalence of COVID-19-infected cancer patients over 60 years old was 0.10 (95% CI 0.07~0.14), higher than that of patients equal and less than 60 years old (0.05, 95% CI 0.03~0.06). The pooled prevalence of severe illness among COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27~0.43) and the pooled death rate of COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14~0.18). The pooled incidence of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with cancers from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.38(0.24, 0.52), 0.36(0.17, 0.55), and 0.26(0.20, 0.31), respectively; and the pooled death rate from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.17(0.10, 0.24), 0.26(0.13, 0.39), and 0.19(0.13, 0.25), respectively. Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients, severe illness incidence and mortality rate. The prevalence of cancer varied significantly in geographical continents and ages. The COVID-19 patients with cancer were at-risk for severe illness and a high death rate. The European COVID-19 patients had the highest cancer prevalence among the three continents examined and were also the most likely to progress to severe illness and death. Although the Asia Pacific COVID-19 patients had the lowest cancer prevalence, their severe illness rate was similar to that of European.","Kong, X.; Qi, Y.; Huang, J.; Zhao, Y.; Zhan, Y.; Qin, X.; Qi, Z.; Atanda, A.; Zhang, L.; Wang, J.; Fang, Y.; Jia, P.; Golozar, A.; Zhang, L.; Jiang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20177311v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20177311v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
41,High SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Children and Adults in the Austrian Ski Resort Ischgl,"Background: Early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. Methods: Between April 21 and 27, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study targeting the full population of Ischgl (n= 1867), of which 79% could be included (n=1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined seroprevalence on virus transmission. Findings: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% CI 39.8-44.7). Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI 21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2-47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356-0.682, p<0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded, corresponding to an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03-0.91). Only 8 (0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this study. Interpretation: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occured due to the dual impact from the non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) and a significant immunization of the Ischgl population.

42,Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.","Robertson, J.; Gostner, J.

43,SARS-Cov-2 proliferation: an analytical aggregate-level model,"An intuitive mathematical model describing the virus proliferation is presented and its parameters estimated from time series of observed reported CoViD-19 cases in Germany. The model replicates the main essential characteristics of the proliferation in a stylized form, and thus can support the systematic reasoning about interventional measures (or their lifting) that were discussed during summer and which currently become relevant again in some countries. The model differs in form from elementary SIR models, but is contained in the general Kermack-McKendrick (1927) model. It is maintained that (compared to elementary SIR models) the model is more faithfully representing real proliferation at the instantaneous level, leading to overall more plausible association of model parameters to physical transmission and recovery parameters. The main policy- oriented results are that (1) mitigation measures imposed in March 2020 in Germany were absolutely necessary to avoid health care resource exhaustion, (2) fast response is key to containment in case of renewed outbreaks. A model generalization aiming to better represent the true infectiousness profile is stated.","Pitschel, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178301v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178301v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
44,"Longitudinal analysis of virus load, serum antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity in vitro in cases with less severe COVID-19","Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a highly variable clinical course, varying from barely discernible signs of disease, to moderate flu-like symptoms and, occasionally, with life-threatening pneumonia and/or cytokine storm. The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein as well the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients has not been investigated longitudinally so far. Methods: Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed and validated for the longitudinal investigation in three patients of a family which underwent a mild course of COVID-19. Findings: We observed that the virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks, whereas serum antibodies showed a contrasting course. IgA levels to S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau approximately six weeks after disease onset. NAbs in serum reached a peak about four weeks after disease onset but dropped to a lower level about six weeks later. Interpretation: Our data establishes associations of virus neutralization and a serological immune response foremost against Sars-CoV-2 S1-RDB-protein in a longitudinal manner.","Flehmig, B.; Schindler, M.; Ruetalo, N.; Businger, R.; Bayer, M.; Haage, A.; Kirchner, T.; Klingel, K.; Normann, A.; Pridzun, L.; Tougianidou, D.; Ranke, M.

45,Prevalence and correlation of symptoms and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The COVID-19 affected millions of people, and the patients present a constellation of symptoms and comorbidities. We aimed to chronicle the prevalence and correlations of symptoms and comorbidities, and associated covariates among the patients. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis [PROSPERO registration: CRD42020182677]. Databases [PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, WHO, Semantic Scholar, and COVID-19 Primer] were searched for clinical studies published in English from January 1 to April 20, 2020. The pooled prevalence of symptoms and comorbidities were identified using the random effect model, and sub-groups analysis of patients age and locations were investigated. A multivariable factor analysis was also performed to show the correlation among symptoms, comorbidities and age of the COVID-19 patients. Findings: Twenty-nine articles [China (24); Outside of China (5)], with 4,884 COVID-19 patients were included in this systematic review. The meta-analysis investigated 33 symptoms, where fever [84%], cough/dry cough [61%], and fatigue/weakness [42%] were found frequent. Out of 43 comorbidities investigated, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [61%] was a common condition, followed by hypertension [23%] and diabetes [12%]. According to the patients age, the prevalence of symptoms like fatigue/weakness, dyspnea/shortness of breath, and anorexia were highly prevalent in older adults [[&ge;]50 years] than younger adults [<50 years]. Diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and COPD/lung disease were more prevalent comorbidities in older adults than younger adults. The patients from outside of China had significantly higher prevalence [p<0.005] of diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, sore throat, and dyspnea, and the prevalent comorbidities in that region were diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ARDS. The multivariable factor analysis showed positive association between a group of symptoms and comorbidities, and with the patients age. Interpretation: Epitomizing the correlation of symptoms of COVID-19 with comorbidities and patients age would help clinicians effectively manage the patients.","Rahman, M.

46,"The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States","Background. People of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of young adult people of color. Method. An online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and Latinx adults (18 to 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias. Results. Employment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health measures across all groups. Conclusions. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.","Fisher, C.

47,Testing for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in populations with low infection prevalence: the largely ignored problem of false positives and the value of repeat testing,"Background: Calls are increasing for widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection testing of people from populations with a very low prevalence of infection. We quantified the impact of less than perfect diagnostic test accuracy on populations, and on individuals, in low prevalence settings, focusing on false positives and the role of confirmatory testing. Methods: We developed a simple, interactive tool to assess the impact of different combinations of test sensitivity, specificity and infection prevalence in a notional population of 100,000. We derived numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, positive predictive value (PPV, the percentage of test positives that are true positives) and overall test accuracy for three testing strategies: (1) single test for all; (2) add repeat testing in test positives; (3) add further repeat testing in those with discrepant results. We also assessed the impact on test results for individuals having one, two or three tests under these three strategies. Results: With sensitivity of 80%, infection prevalence of 1 in 2,000, and specificity 99.9% on all tests, PPV in the tested population of 100,000 will be only 29% with one test, increasing to >99.5% (100% when rounded to the nearest %) with repeat testing in strategies 2 or 3. More realistically, if specificity is 95% for the first and 99.9% for subsequent tests, single test PPV will be only 1%, increasing to 86% with repeat testing in strategy 2, or 79% with strategy 3 (albeit with 6 fewer false negatives than strategy 2). In the whole population, or in particular individuals, PPV increases as infection becomes more common in the population but falls to unacceptably low levels with lower test specificity. Conclusion: To avoid multiple unnecessary restrictions on whole populations, and in particular individuals, from widespread population testing for SARS-CoV-2, the crucial roles of extremely high test specificity and of confirmatory testing must be fully appreciated and incorporated into policy decisions.","Sudlow, C.; Diggle, P.; Warlow, O.; Seymour, D.; Gordon, B.; Walker, R.; Warlow, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178137v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178137v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
48,Self assessment overestimates historical COVID-19 disease relative to sensitive serological assays: cross sectional study in UK key workers,"Objective To measure the association between self-reported signs and symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Design Cross sectional study of three key worker groups. Setting Six acute NHS hospitals and two Police and Fire and Rescue sites in England. Participants Individuals were recruited from three streams: (A) Police and Fire and Rescue services (n=1147), (B) healthcare workers (n=1546) and (C) healthcare workers with previously positive virus detection (n=154). Main outcome measures Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma. Results 943 of the 2847 participants (33%) reported belief they had had COVID-19, having experienced compatible symptoms (including 152 from Stream C). Among individuals reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms, 466 (49%) were seronegative on both Nucleoprotein (Roche) and Spike-protein (EUROIMMUN) antibody assays. However, among the 268 individuals with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, of whom 96% reported symptoms with onset a median of 63 days (IQR 52 to 75 days) prior to venesection, Roche and EUROIMMUN assays had 96.6% (95% CI 93.7% to 98.2%) and 93.3% (95% CI 89.6% to 95.7%) sensitivity respectively. Symptomatic but seronegative individuals had significantly earlier symptom onset dates than the symptomatic seropositive individuals, shorter illness duration and a much lower anosmia reporting frequency. Conclusions Self-reported belief of COVID-19 was common among our frontline worker cohort. About half of these individuals were seronegative, despite a high sensitivity of serology in this cohort, at least in individuals with previous positive PCR results. This is compatible with non-COVID-19 respiratory disease during the COVID-19 outbreak having been commonly mistaken for COVID-19 within the key worker cohort studied.","Mulchandani, R.; Taylor-Phillips, S.; Jones, H.; Ades, T.; Borrow, R.; Linley, E.; Kirwan, P.; Stewart, R.; Moore, P.; Boyes, J.; Hormis, A.; Todd, N.; Colda, A.; Reckless, I.; Brooks, T.; Charlett, A.; Hickman, M.; Oliver, I.; Wyllie, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178186v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178186v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
49,Preventing within household transmission of COVID-19: Is self-isolation outside the home feasible and acceptable?,"Background Within-household transmission of COVID-19 is responsible for a significant number of infections. The risk of within-household infection is greatly increased among those from Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and low income communities. Efforts to protect these communities are urgently needed. The aim of this study is to explore the acceptability of provision of accommodation to support isolation outside the home among at risk populations. Methods Our study used a mixed methods design structured in two phases. In phase 1, we conducted a survey study of a sample of volunteers from our existing database of 300 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into reducing infection transmission. In phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from BAME communities and low income communities recruited through social media. Results Many participants from both the survey and interview phase of the study viewed the provision of accommodation to support isolation as both important and necessary to protect the household and control the virus. Factors influencing likely uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) vulnerability of household 2) exposure to the virus and 3) options for isolation within the home. Barriers to isolation outside the home included 1) being able to isolate at home 2) not wanting to be apart from family 3) caring for others 4) concerns about the implications of isolation for mental wellbeing 5) upheaval of moving when ill and 6) perceived risk to and from others in the building. Participants raised a series of issues surrounding the provision of accommodation outside the home that should be addressed before it could be offered. These included questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and at what stage to effectively reduce transmission in the home, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. Concerns were also raised among those with caring duties and responsibilities. Conclusion This research provides evidence that the provision of accommodation to support isolation outside the home is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by many people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home. We explore ways in which isolation outside the home might be offered to suit the needs of people in different circumstances. In particular, vulnerable members of the household could be protected if accommodation is offered to individuals who are informed through test trace and isolate that they have been in contact with the virus.","Denford, S.; Morton, K.

50,How early into the outbreak can surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater tell us?,"There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of the outbreak within a community. Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases needed in a community to result in a positive detection of the virus in wastewaters. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.","Hong, P.; Rachmadi, A.

51,Estimating healthcare resource needs for COVID-19 patients in Nigeria,"Background: Predicting potential healthcare resource use under different scenarios will help to prepare the healthcare system for a surge in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aim to predict the effect of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Nigeria. Method: We adopted a previously published discrete-time, individual-level, health-state transition model of symptomatic COVID-19 patients to the Nigerian healthcare system and COVID-19 epidemiology. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectories and acute care capacity. Primary outcomes included expected cumulative number of cases, days until depletion resources, and the number of deaths associated with resource constraints. Outcomes were predicted over a 60-day time horizon. Results: In our best-case epidemic trajectory, which implies successful implementation of public health measures to control COVID-19 spread, the current number of ventilator resources in Nigeria (conservative resources scenario), were expended within five days, and 901 patients may die while waiting for hospital resources in conservative resource scenario. In our expanded resource scenarios, ventilated ICU beds were depleted in all three epidemic trajectories within 60 days. Acute care resources were only sufficient in the best-case and intermediate epidemic scenarios, combined with a substantial increase in healthcare resources. Conclusion: Current hospital resources are inadequate to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Given Nigeria's limited resources, it is imperative to increase healthcare resources and maintain aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Ogunbameru, A.; Barrett, K.; Joda, A.; Khan, Y.

52,Pandemic Control in ECON-EPI Networks,"We develop an ECON-EPI network model to evaluate policies designed to improve health and economic outcomes during a pandemic. Relative to the standard epidemiological SIR set-up, we explicitly model social contacts among individuals and allow for heterogeneity in their number and stability. In addition, we embed the network in a structural economic model describing how contacts generate economic activity. We calibrate it to the New York metro area during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis and show three main results. First, the ECON-EPI network implies patterns of infections that better match the data compared to the standard SIR. The switching during the early phase of the pandemic from unstable to stable contacts is crucial for this result. Second, the model suggests the design of smart policies that reduce infections and at the same time boost economic activity. Third, the model shows that reopening sectors characterized by numerous and unstable contacts (such as large events or schools) too early leads to fast growth of infections.","Fogli, A.; Perri, F.; Ponder, M.; Azzimonti, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178087v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178087v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
53,"CLINICAL COURSE, RISK FACTORS FOR TRANSFER TO ICU AND MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AFFECTED BY ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE REFERRED TO A RESPIRATORY INTERMEDIATATE CARE UNIT.","Introduction There are no clear guidelines as yet for the selection of patients affected by COVID-19 who can be treated in intermediate RICU, neither shared criteria for their intubation and transfer in ICU. In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death. More studies need to be performed on COVID-19 patients, in the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","Buonamico, E.; Quaranta, V.

55,Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic β-CoVs,"The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.","Pontes, C.; Ruiz-Serra, V.

56,Temporal landscape of mutation accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh: possible implications from the ongoing outbreak in Bangladesh,"Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population. Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","Saha, O.; Shatadru, R.

57,In Silico Modeling of Virus Particle Propagation and Infectivity along the Respiratory Tract: A Case Study for SARS-COV-2,"Respiratory viruses including Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus and cornaviruses such as Middle Eastern respiratory virus (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 infect and cause serious and sometimes fatal disease in thousands of people annually. It is critical to understand virus propagation dynamics within the respiratory system because new insights will increase our understanding of virus pathogenesis and enable infection patterns to be more predictable in vivo, which will enhance targeting of vaccines and drug delivery. This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network.

58,Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.","Lapointe, C.

59,Targeting pentose phosphate pathway for SARS-CoV-2 therapy,"It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","Bojkova, D.; Costa, R.; Bechtel, M.; Ciesek, S.; Michaelis, M.; Cinatl, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
60,SARS-CoV-2 infects brain choroid plexus and disrupts the blood-CSF-barrier,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leads primarily to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal, particularly in at risk individuals. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","Pellegrini, L.; Albecka, A.; Mallery, D.

61,Limited window for donation of convalescent plasma with high live-virus neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 immunotherapy,"The optimal timeframe for donating convalescent plasma to be used for COVID-19 immunotherapy is unknown. To address this important knowledge deficit, we determined in vitro live-virus neutralizing capacity and persistence of IgM and IgG antibody responses against the receptor-binding domain and S1 ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in 540 convalescent plasma samples obtained from 175 COVID-19 plasma donors for up to 142 days post-symptom onset. Robust IgM, IgG, and viral neutralization responses to SARS-CoV-2 persist, in the aggregate, for at least 100 days post-symptom onset. However, a notable acceleration in decline in virus neutralization titers [&ge;]160, a value suitable for convalescent plasma therapy, was observed starting 60 days after first symptom onset. Together, these findings better define the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma useful for immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients and reveal important predictors of an ideal plasma donor, including age and COVID-19 disease severity score.","Gontu, A.; Srinivasan, S.; Salazar, E.; Surendran Nair, M.; Nissly, R.

62,Characterization of cells susceptible to SARS-COV-2 and methods for detection of neutralizing antibody by focus forming assay,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the urgent need to determine what cells are susceptible to infection and for assays to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the ongoing efforts for vaccine development have necessitated the development of rapid, high-throughput methods of quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ability to screen human polyclonal sera samples for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, our lab has adapted focus forming assays for SARS-CoV-2 using Vero CCL-81 cells, referred to in this text as Vero WHO. Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test. We have shown that this assay is a sensitive tool for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer in human, non-human primate, and mouse polyclonal sera following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, we describe the viral growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of different immortalized cell lines and demonstrate via human ACE2 and viral spike protein expression that these cell lines can support viral entry and replication.","Stone, E.

In an otherwise pseudo-random sequence, we search for forbidden combinations of kth order. We applied this method to analyze the available protein sequences of various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We found that these ubiquitous forbidden orders (UFO) are unique to each of the viruses we analyzed.

There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 mcg/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","Vega, J. C.; Bansal, S.; Jonsson, C. B.; Taylor, S.

65,COVID-19 and Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway: In silico Identification of an Interaction between alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and the Cryptic Epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR.

66,"Astodrimer sodium, dendrimer antiviral, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, J.

It is therefore of great interest to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 140 nm. SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The peplomer density was measured using very thin sections and showed a difference between the two virus isolates. SARS-CoV displayed one-third more peplomers per segmental particle volume than SARS-CoV-2. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, using another isolate of the SARS-CoV-2, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","Laue, M.; Kauter, A.; Hoffmann, T.; Michel, J.; Nitsche, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False

69,A Human-Immune-System mouse model for COVID-19 research(DRAGA mouse: HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2Rγc KO.NOD),"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates, and there is a compelling need for effective vaccines and therapeutic agents to lessen the severity of COVID-19 disease. Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R{gamma}c KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, T.-D.; Vir, P.; Shashikumar, S.; Karim, A.

70,Exploring G and C-quadruplex structures as potential targets against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.

High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gorshkov, K.; Chen, C. Z.; de la Torre, J.

We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing.

73,Susceptibility of raccoon dogs for experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.

74,What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents? Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify mutation signatures and classify SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","Nagpal, S.; Srivastava, D.; Mande, S.

75,SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in lungs of African green monkeys,"Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for unraveling the viral and host factors that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes. Our dataset provides a detailed view of changes in host and virus replication dynamics over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.","Speranza, E.; Williamson, B.

76,A rapid and efficient screening system for neutralizing antibodies and its application for the discovery of potent neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD,"Neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been considered as promising therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathogens. After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2.

77,SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies provides insight into its genetic dynamics during infection,"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","Sun, F.; Wang, X.; Tan, S.; Dan, Y.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Xu, J.; Tan, Z.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Zhang, W.; Chen, Y.; Tan, W.; Deng, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
78,Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

79,SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c Is a Membrane-Associated Protein that Suppresses Antiviral Responses in Cells,"Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

82,Erythroid precursors and progenitors suppress adaptive immunity and get invaded by SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, S.; Xu, L.; Osman, M.; Sligl, W.; Shields, J.; Joyce, M.; Tyrrell, L.; Oyegbami, O.; Elahi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.

85,Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers,"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab')2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab')2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","Cunha, L.

87,Bacterial modification of the host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modulates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.

88,A Lymph Node Targeted Amphiphile Vaccine Induces Potent Cellular and Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to public health, economic, and social consequences that mandate urgent development of effective vaccines to contain or eradicate infection. To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, M. P.; Seenappa, L.

89,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Transmission Depends on Heparan Sulfates and Is Blocked by Low Molecular Weight Heparins,"The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and new outbreaks worldwide highlight the need for preventive treatments. Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed by epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization. These results have imperative implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal an important target for novel prophylactic intervention.","Bermejo-Jambrina, M.; Eder, J.; Kaptein, T.

90,IFITM proteins promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) restrict numerous viral pathogens and are thought to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues. Our finding that IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under conditions approximating the in vivo situation shows that they may promote viral invasion during COVID-19.

91,Spike protein mutational landscape in India: Could Mullers ratchet be a future game-changer for COVID-19?,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

SignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, R.; Basak, K.; Ghosh, A.; Rajachandran, V.; Sureka, K.; Ganguly, D.; Chattopadhyay, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.

93,Generalized linear models provide a measure of virulence for specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains,"This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","Oulas, A.; Zanti, M.; Tomazou, M.; Zachariou, M.; Minadakis, G.; Bourdakou, M.

94,The effect of whey protein on viral infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin coronavirus in vitro,"Since the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human breastmilk, little is known about the antiviral property of human breastmilk to SARS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for the first time that whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication. Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Fan, H.; Luo, Y.; Hong, B.; Wang, L.; Jin, X.; Chen, Y.; Hu, Y.; Li, T.; Zhuang, H.; Zhou, Y.-H.; Tong, Y.-G.; Xiang, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False
95,"SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Antagonizes Type I and III Interferons by Targeting Multiple Components of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING Signaling Pathways","Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a catastrophic effect on human health and society. Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, L.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, J.; Nan, M.-L.; Wang, P.-H.; Gao, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provide comparatively universally accepted guidelines for website accessibility. We utilized these parameters to examine the number of countries with or without accessible health authority websites. The resulting data indicate a dearth of countries with websites accessible for persons with disabilities.

97,"SARS-Cov-2-, HIV-1-, Ebola-neutralizing and anti-PD1 clones are predisposed","Antibody repertoire refers to the totality of the superbly diversified antibodies within an individual to cope with the vast array of possible pathogens. Despite this extreme diversity, antibodies of the same clonotype, namely public clones, have been discovered among individuals. Although some public clones could be explained by antibody convergence, public clones in naive repertoire or virus-neutralizing clones from not infected people were also discovered. All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals.

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries.
