0,College campuses and COVID-19 mitigation: clinical and economic value,"Background: Decisions around US college and university operations will affect millions of students and faculty amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the clinical and economic value of different COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. Methods: We used the Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation that tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. Outcomes include infections, $/infection-prevented, and $/quality-adjusted-life-year ($/QALY). Strategies included extensive social distancing (ESD), masks, and routine laboratory tests (RLT). We report results per 5,000 students (1,000 faculty) over one semester (105 days). Results: Mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases among students (faculty) from 3,746 (164) with no mitigation to 493 (28) with ESD and masks, and further to 151 (25) adding RLTq3 among asymptomatic students and faculty. ESD with masks cost $168/infection-prevented ($49,200/QALY) compared to masks alone. Adding RLTq3 ($10/test) cost $8,300/infection-prevented ($2,804,600/QALY). If tests cost $1, RLTq3 led to a favorable cost of $275/infection-prevented ($52,200/QALY). No strategies without masks were cost-effective. Conclusion: Extensive social distancing with mandatory mask-wearing could prevent 87% of COVID-19 cases on college campuses and be very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low cost tests to be economically attractive.","Losina, E.; Leifer, V.; Millham, L.; Panella, C.; Hyle, E. P.; Mohareb, A.

1,Switched and unswitched memory B cells detected during SARS-CoV-2 convalescence correlate with limited symptom duration,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the pandemic human respiratory illness COVID-19, is a global health emergency. While severe acute disease has been linked to an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, we sought to identify B cell responses that correlated with positive clinical outcomes in convalescent patients. We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects. Memory B cell subsets in convalescent subjects were composed of classical CD24+ class-switched memory B cells, but also activated CD24-negative and natural unswitched CD27+ IgD+ IgM+ subsets. Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). IgM+ memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over time. Our findings suggest that the frequency of memory B cells is a critical indicator of disease resolution, and that IgM+ memory B cells play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 immunity.","Newell, K.

2,"Long, thin transmission chains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) may go undetected for several weeks at low to moderate reproductive numbers: Implications for containment and elimination strategy","Especially at low to moderate reproductive numbers, the generally mild, non-specific symptomology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) allows long, thin transmission chains to go undetected by passive surveillance over several weeks. This phenomenon has important implications: (1) Surveillance becomes less sensitive and reliable as an indicator of freedom from infection at the low reproductive numbers required to achieve elimination end points, passive surveillance systems may need to document an absence of new cases for at least a month to establish certainty of elimination. (2) Reproductive numbers should be kept as low as possible throughout such follow up periods without confirmed cases, to ensure such long, thin, undetected transmission chains all collapse before restrictions are eased and reproduction numbers are allowed to rebound. (3) While contact tracing systems may be highly effective when applied to large clusters in foci of elevated transmission where wide, rapidly expanding transmission chains are detected within two viral generations, large fractions of community transmission occurring through thinner, more extended transmission chains at lower reproductive numbers are often be too long to trace retrospectively and will be underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or younger age groups with lower rates of overt symptoms dominate transmission, containment effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. While, contact tracing and isolation will remain vital for at least partially containing larger outbreaks, containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will have to rely primarily upon the more burdensome and presumptive population-wide prevention measures that have proven so effective thus far against community transmission. Furthermore, these will have to be sustained at a much more stringent level and for longer periods after the last detected case than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1.","Killeen, G.

3,Predicting the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks after the peak in daily fatalities,"The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemics has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an essential role both for the baseline infection rate and the short-term and long-term reaction to the outbreak. Here we investigate how societies as a whole, and governments, in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalisation of the SIR model, the controlled SIR model. We posit that containment measures correspond to feedback between the status of the outbreak (the daily or the cumulative number of cases and fatalities) and the reproduction factor. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short- and long-term control parameters. Furthermore, we identified for numerous countries a relationship between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak in daily fatalities. As the number of fatalities corresponds to the number of hospitalised patients, the relationship can be used to predict the cumulative medical load, once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.","Gros, C.; Valenti, R.; Schneider, L.; Gutsche, B.; Markovic, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20183384v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20183384v1?rss=1,2020-09-05,2020-09-05,,True
4,The role of school reopening in the spread of COVID-19,"Many countries chose to close schools as part of their response to the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Whilst nations are gradually reopening schools, and many politicians advise that schools remain safe and the risks of increases in the spread of COVID-19 are low, little evidence has been presented to confirm those statements. A review of the numbers of new confirmed COVID-19 cases by country suggests that the reopening of schools is likely to be a driver in the increase of the number of new cases. This is likely exacerbated by accompanying changes and easing of restrictions. However, with the exception of China, notable for its robust test, track, trace, and isolate processes, no other countries that had significant numbers of COVID-19 cases have successfully reopened schools without an increase in cases as a consequence. Whilst reopening of schools following an initial peak and decrease in COVID-19 infections is desirable for a range of reasons, doing so without adequate controls and protections may lead to an exacerbation of spread within the school environment, which could then lead to increased community spread of disease.","Beesley, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187757v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187757v1?rss=1,2020-09-05,2020-09-05,,True
5,Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with increased antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis,"The pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated thrombosis seems to be multifactorial, involving interplay between cellular and plasmatic elements of the hemostasis. We hypothesized that COVID-19 is accompanied by platelet apoptosis with subsequent alteration of the coagulation system. We investigated depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m), cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration, and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization by flow cytometry. Platelets from intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients (n=21) showed higher {Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization, compared to healthy controls (n=18) and COVID-19 non-ICU patients (n=4). Moreover significant higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS was observed compared to septic ICU control group (ICU control). In ICU control group (n=5; non-COVID-19 ICU) cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization was comparable to healthy control, with an increase in {Delta}{Psi}m depolarization. Sera from ICU COVID-19 patients induced significant increase in apoptosis markers ({Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization) compared to healthy volunteer and septic ICU control. Interestingly, immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from COVID-19 patients induced an Fc gamma receptor IIA dependent platelet apoptosis ({Delta}{Psi}m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and PS externalization). Enhanced PS externalization in platelets from ICU COVID-19 patients was associated with increased sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (r=0.5635) and D-Dimer (r=0.4473). Most importantly, patients with thrombosis had significantly higher PS externalization compared to those without. The strong correlations between apoptosis markers and increased D-Dimer levels as well as the incidence of thrombosis may indicate that antibody-mediated platelet apoptosis potentially contributes to sustained increased thromboembolic risk in ICU COVID-19 patients.","Althaus, K.; Marini, I.; Zlamal, J.; Pelzl, L.; Haeberle, H.; Mehrlaender, M.; Hammer, S.; Schulze, H.; Bitzer, M.; Malek, N.; Rath, D.; Boesmueller, H.; Nieswandt, B.; Gawaz, M.; Bakchoul, T.; Rosenberger, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187286v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187286v1?rss=1,2020-09-05,2020-09-05,,True
6,Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity,"As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.","Lavine, J.

7,High prevalence of deep venous thrombosis in non-severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized for a neurovascular disease,"Abstract Introduction: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for COVID-19, is accompanied by venous thromboembolic events particularly in intensive care unit. In non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of or study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. Methods: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, consecutive patients with neurovascular diseases with non-severe COVID-19 were investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. Results Thirteen patients were enrolled including 10 acute ischemic strokes, one transient ischemic attack, one cerebral venous thrombosis and one haemorrhagic stroke. At admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). We found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves DVT (n=5) during the first week after admission despite thromboprophylaxis. Among them, one patient had a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Two patients died during hospitalization but the outcome was favourable in the others with a discharge median NIHSS of 1 (IQR, 0-11). Discussion/Conclusion: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence of 38.5% of DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients with neurovascular diseases. Therefore, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation should be performed in all patients of this category.","Rouyer, O.; Pierre-Paul, I.-N.; Balde, A.; Jupitet, D.; Bindila, D.; Geny, B.; Wolff, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187344v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.20187344v1?rss=1,2020-09-05,2020-09-05,,True
8,Utility of Olfactory test as screening tool for COVID-19: A pilot study,"Loss of smell function (Anosmia) is reported to be associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an indigenously developed prototype smell test to identify/diagnose asymptomatic COVID-19 positive individuals. A panel of five different odorants belonging to Indian household with unique and mutually exclusive odor were used to develop prototype kit to test the hypothesis. The developed prototype kit was tested at 2 centers (N=49 and 34) with slight modifications. Simultaneously, the kit was also tested on 55 (N=35 and 20) healthy controls. Our results indicate that otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 positive individuals were having quantifiable deficit in smell sensation. Interestingly, the variable sensitivity of different odorants was observed in different patients. None of the healthy controls reported difficulty in sensing any of the odorant, whereas, some of healthy controls did misidentify the odorants. Overall, the present study provides a preliminary data that loss in smell sensation for various odorants can be exploited as a quick and affordable screening test to identify infected cases among at risk individuals.","Khare, P.; Chander, A.

9,Public Preferences for Government Response Policies on Outbreak Control,"Objectives: To assess the extent to which public support for outbreak containment policies varies with respect to the severity of an infectious disease outbreak. Methods: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1,017 residents of Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, gender and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among 5 policies restricting local movement and 4 border control policies) they would support in 5 randomly-assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics and perceived policy effectiveness. Results: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies; however, was generally higher for border control policies compared to internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher income and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.","Ozdemir, S.; Tan, S. N.

11,"SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny during the early outbreak in the Basel area, Switzerland: import and spread dominated by a single B.1 lineage variant (C15324T)","Background: The first local case of SARS-CoV-2 in Basel, Switzerland, was detected on February 26th 2020. We present a phylogenetic cross-sectional study and explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26th until March 23rd. Methods: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from naso-oropharyngeal swabs and generated 468 high quality genomes and called variants with our COVID-19 Genome Analysis Pipeline (COVGAP). We analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. For identification of introduction and dissemination events across the Basel area a time-calibrated phylogeny was inferred including global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Findings: Our samples exhibit low lineage diversity compared to neighbouring countries. Lineage B.1 (82.7%), detected from March 2nd, dominated infections in Basel. A large clade within B.1 contains 69.1% of our samples, all of which carry the SNP C15324T, suggesting local transmission in spreading events. We have located the geographic origin of this mutation in our tri-national region. The remaining genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, evidencing several events of introduction from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world. Further, we have identified several transmission events within families. Interpretation: Molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 by phylogenetic reconstruction in the Basel area provides important insights into local transmission (spreading events and family transmission). This phylogenetic analysis enriches epidemiological and contact tracing data, allowing connection of seemingly unconnected events and drawing conclusions, which can be used to inform public health interventions. Funding: No dedicated funding was used for this work.","Stange, M.; Mari, A.; Roloff, T.; Seth-Smith, H. M. B.; Schweitzer, M.; Brunner, M.; Leuzinger, K.; Sogaard, K.

12,COVID-19 hospitalizations in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS),"Objective: To study the profile of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil and to identify factors associated with hospital mortality related to the disease. Methods: Cross-sectional study, based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in SUS, between the last days of February and June. Patients aged 18 years or older, with primary or secondary diagnoses indicative of COVID-19 were included. Bivariate analyses were performed and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were estimated with random effects intercept. The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. Results: 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in SUS were predominantly male (56.5%), with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (STD=6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The chances of hospital death among men were 16.8% higher than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher chance of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states had a higher risk of hospital death from COVID-19, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro. The chances of hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants and being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. Conclusion: There was wide variation in hospital COVID-19 mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care.","de Andrade, C.

13,Assessment of COVID-19 Pandemic in Nepal: A Lockdown Scenario Analysis,"The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21 July 2020, prohibiting domestic and international travels, border closures and closure of non-essential services. We collated the data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population and assessed scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal during the lockdown period. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported total 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreak after easing lockdown.","Parajuli, K.

14,Estimating COVID-19 hospital demand using a non-parametric model: a case study in Galicia (Spain),"Understanding the demand for hospital beds for COVID-19 patients is key for decision-making and planning mitigation strategies, as overwhelming healthcare systems has critical consequences for disease mortality. However, accurately mapping the time-to-event of hospital outcomes, such as the length-of-stay in the ICU, requires understanding patient trajectories while adjusting for covariates and observation bias, such as incomplete data. Standard methods, like the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients hospitalized, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a nonparametric Mixture Cure Model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward/ICU lengths-of-stay to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and hospital ward length-of-stay estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We provided evidence that adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models, together with age is key for accurately forecasting ICU occupancy, as well as discharge or death outcomes.","Lopez-Cheda, A.; Jacome, M.

15,Swab pooling for large-scale RT-qPCR screening of SARS-CoV-2,"Pool testing has been proposed as an alternative for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, dilution factors proportional to the number of pooled samples have been a source of major concern regarding its diagnostic performance. Further, sample pooling can lead to increased laboratory workload and operational complexity. Therefore, pooling strategies that minimize sample dilution, loss of sensitivity, and laboratory overload are needed to allow reliable and large-scale screenings of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a pooling procedure in which nasopharyngeal swabs are pooled together at the time of sample collection (swab pooling), decreasing laboratory manipulation and minimizing dilution of the viral RNA present in the samples. Paired analysis of pooled and individual samples from 613 patients revealed 94 positive individual tests. Having individual testing as a reference, no false-positives or false-negatives were observed for swab pooling. A Bayesian model estimated a sensitivity of 99% (Cr.I. 96.9% to 100%) and a specificity of 99.8% (Cr.I. 99.4% to 100%) for the swab pooling procedure. Data from additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling were included for further quantitative analysis. Mean Cq differences between individual and corresponding pool samples ranged from 0.1 Cq (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 Cq (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays, resulting in 246 positive patients (positivity rate 1.26%). This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Finally, these data demonstrate that swab pooling can significantly minimize sample dilution and sensitivity issues commonly seen in its traditional counterpart.

16,FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A RETURN-TO-WORK PROTOCOL BASED ON COVID-19 ANTIBODIES TESTING,"Abstract Introduction: Prior to the diagnosis of the first SARS-CoV2 patient in Florida, the Miami Dade Fire Rescue developed and implemented its return-to-work protocol based on guidelines from the CDC and Florida Fire Chiefs Association. As of February 17, 2020, all asymptomatic employees exposed to PCR-confirmed positive SARS-CoV2 individuals would be excluded from work for 14 days and report absence of symptoms to a delegated supervisor every 24 hours. We postulated that if COVID-19 transmission rate continues at the current rate in the absence of systemic vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV2, then a safer and more efficient return-to-work policy is needed for exposed first responders who are identified as low-risk for disease transmission. Objectives: We sought to establish a safe and shortened return-to-work protocol to maintain our workforce. We evaluated the utility of serological antibody testing in predicting negative seroconversion of first responders at 7 days post low-risk exposure to confirmed COVID-19 individuals. Methods: All exposed, asymptomatic employees underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV2 one week after the initial exposure. Participants who were serologically negative had follow-up RT-PCR within 24 hours and serology testing 14 days after the initial serological test. Results: Overall, of the 71 firefighters who have had documented exposures to SARS-CoV2 positive individuals in the fire rescue agency, 41 of 71 had initially negative serology studies. Of the 41 patients with negative serology studies, 20 voluntarily underwent confirmatory PCR testing within one day after serology testing and all 20 participants were negative. Subsequently, out of the 20 participants who underwent serology and PCR testing, 10 participants followed up and underwent repeat serology testing 14 days after exposure and all 10 participants had negative repeat serology tests. The other ten who chose not to retest remained asymptomatic 14 days after exposure. Conclusions: Although serology testing has limitations, it correlated with negative prediction of disease in low-risk participants with exposures in this study. Serology testing may offer a feasible, alternative return-to-work strategy for fire agencies.

17,Viable virus aerosol propagation by PAP circuit leak and mitigation with a ventilated patient hood: a model for improving health care worker safety in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable respiratory viruses. These aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit and the mitigation of virus propagation by an air filter combined with a plastic canopy. Methods: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit within a non-vented clinical room. Mask leak was systematically varied to allow 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host assessed the degree of viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread, the efficacy of a simple, low-cost ventilated headboard, created from a plastic tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. Findings: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (chisquared=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (>21 L/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1m from the leak source, however, viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. Interpretation: Mask leak from PAP circuits may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical levels of leak should be treated as an infectious risk. Cheap and low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","Landry, S.

18,SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and limited inflammatory cytokines are present in the stool of select patients with acute COVID-19,"Background and aims: Immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to play a pathogenic role in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 can infect a variety of host cells, including intestinal epithelial cells. We sought to characterize the role of the gastrointestinal immune system in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. Methods: We measured cytokines, inflammatory markers, viral RNA, microbiome composition and antibody responses in stool and serum samples from a prospectively enrolled cohort of 44 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool of 41% of patients and was found more frequently in patients with diarrhea than those without (16[44%] vs 5[19%], p=0.06). Patients who survived had lower median viral genome copies than those who did not (p=0.021). Compared to uninfected controls, COVID-19 patients had higher median fecal levels of IL-8 (166.5 vs 286.5 pg/mg; p=0.05) and lower levels of fecal IL-10 (678 vs 194 pg/mg; p<0.001) compared to uninfected controls. Stool IL-23 was higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 disease (223.8 vs 86.6 pg/mg; p=0.03) and we find evidence of intestinal virus-specific IgA responses, which was associated with more severe disease. Fecal cytokines and calprotectin levels were not correlated with gastrointestinal symptoms or with the level of virus detected. Conclusions: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in the stools of COVID-19 patients and select individuals had evidence for a specific mucosal IgA response, intestinal inflammation was limited, even in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms.","Britton, G.

19,Adjusted Dynamics of COVID-19 Pandemic due to Herd Immunity in Bangladesh,"Amid growing debate between scientists and policymakers on the trade-off between public safety and reviving economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Bangladesh decided to relax the countrywide lockdown restrictions from the beginning of June 2020. Instead, the Ministry of Public Affairs officials have declared some parts of the capital city and a few other districts as red zones or high-risk areas based on the number of people infected in the late June 2020. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 infection rate had been increasing in almost every other part of the country. Ironically, rather than ensuring rapid tests and isolation of COVID-19 patients, from the beginning of July 2020, the Directorate General of Health Services restrained the maximum number of tests per laboratory. Thus, the health experts have raised the question of whether the government is heading toward achieving herd immunity instead of containing the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, the dynamics of the pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh are analyzed with the SIRD model. We demonstrate that the herd immunity threshold can be reduced to 31% than that of 60% by considering age group cluster analysis resulting in a total of 53.0 million susceptible populations. With the data of Covid-19 cases till July 22, 2020, the time-varying reproduction numbers are used to explain the nature of the pandemic. Based on the estimations of active, severe, and critical cases, we discuss a set of policy recommendations to improve the current pandemic control methods in Bangladesh.","Hoque, E.; Islam, M.

20,Impact of baseline cases of cough and fever on UK COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates: estimates from the Bug Watch community cohort study,"Background: Diagnostic testing forms a major part of the UK's response to the current COVID-19 pandemic with tests offered to people with a continuous cough, high temperature or anosmia. Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. Methods: In this analysis of the Bug Watch prospective community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018-2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests and four second wave scenarios and then compared to current national capacity. Results: The baseline incidence of cough or fever in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 154,554 (95%CI 103,083 - 231,725) cases per day in August 2020 to 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 - 347,080) in September, peaking at 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 - 559,988) in December. If 80% of baseline cough or fever cases request tests, average daily UK testing demand would exceed current capacity for five consecutive months (October 2020 to February 2021), with a peak demand of 147,240 (95%CI 73,978 - 239,502) tests per day above capacity in December 2020. Conclusions: Our results show that current national COVID-19 testing capacity is likely to be exceeded by demand due to baseline cough and fever alone. This study highlights that the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is immediately scaled up to meet this high predicted demand.","Eyre, M.

21,Household Secondary Attack Rate in Gandhinagar district of Gujarat state from Western India,"Objectives: Current retrospective study aims to evaluate household Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) of COVID-19 in Gandhinagar (rural) district of Gujarat, India. Methods: Line-listing of 486 laboratory-confirmed patients, tested between 28th March to 2nd July was collected, out of them 80 (15% of overall sample) cases were randomly selected. Demographic, clinical and household details of cases were collected through telephonic interview. During interview 28 more patients were identified from the same household and were added accordingly. So, study included 74 unrelated cluster of households with 74 primary cases and 386 close contacts. Results: SAR in household contacts of COVID-19 in Gandhinagar was 8.8%. Out of 108, 8 patients expired (7.4%), where higher mortality was observed in primary cases (9.5%) as compared to secondary cases (3%). Occupational analysis showed that majority of the secondary cases (88%) were not working and hence had higher contact time with patient. No out-of-pocket expenditure occurred in 94% of the patients, in remaining 6% average expenditure of 1,49,633INR (2027 USD) was recorded. Conclusions: Key observations from the study are 1) SAR of 8.8% is relatively low and hence home isolation of the cases can be continued 2) Primary case is more susceptible to fatal outcome as compared to secondary cases 3) Government has covered huge population of the COVID-19 patients under cost protection. However, more robust studies with larger datasets are needed to further validate the findings.","Shah, K.; Desai, N.; Saxena, D.; Mavalankar, D.; Mishra, U.; Patel, G.

22,A SARS-CoV-2 - host proximity interactome,"Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.","Samavarchi-Tehrani, P.; Abdouni, H.; Knight, J.

23,Multimerization- and glycosylation-dependent receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins,"Receptor binding studies using recombinant SARS-CoV proteins have been hampered due to challenges in approaches creating spike protein or domains thereof, that recapitulate receptor binding properties of native viruses. We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, K. M.; Tomris, I.; Turner, H.

24,Clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data reveals population structure of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been spreading rapidly and across the globe since first being reported in December 2019. To understand the evolutionary trajectory of the coronavirus, phylogenetic analysis is needed to study the population structure of SARS-CoV-2. As sequencing data worldwide is accruing rapidly, grouping them into clusters helps to organize the landscape of population structures. To effectively group these data, computational methodologies are needed to provide more productive and robust solutions for clustering. In this study, using the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the viral sequences as input features, we utilized three clustering algorithms, namely K-means, hierarchical clustering and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies to partition the viral sequences into six major clusters. Comparison of the three clustering results reveals that the three methods produced highly consistent results, but K-means performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances among the three methods. The partition of the viral sequences revealed that the six clusters differed in their geographical distributions. Using comprehensive approaches to compare the diversity and selective pressure across the clusters, we discovered a high genetic diversity between the clusters. Based on characteristics of the mutation profiles in each cluster along with their geographical distributions and evolutionary histories, we identified the extent of molecular divergence within and between the clusters. The identification of the mutations that are strongly associated with clusters have potential implications for diagnosis and pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, the clustering method will enable further study of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.","Li, Y.; Liu, Q.; Luo, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1,2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,False
25,Monoclonal Antibodies Capable of Binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Motif Specifically Prevent GM-CSF Induction.,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited cytokine storm, and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Qiang, X.; Zhu, S.; Li, J.; Wang, P.; Tracey, K.

26,SARS-CoV-2 infection paralyzes cytotoxic and metabolic functions of immune cells,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 infectious disease outbreak, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in 10 acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. Our findings reveal patients who suffer from an over activation of the immune system, a change of composition in infusion/intravenous fluids during infection with the aim to lower blood levels of glucose, glutamate, acetate and formate could avoid a life-threatening cytokine storm.

The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion (21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus. Inclusion of the French cohort enabled us to identify 161 novel mutations never reported in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected worldwide.

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. Our candidate OZG-3861 version 1 (V1) is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1) is the GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine candidate. We applied the candidates intradermal to BALB/c mice to assess the toxicity and immunogenicity of the OZG-3861 V1 and SK-01 V1. Here, we report our preliminary results in vaccinated mice. When considered in terms of T and B cell responses, it was observed that especially the vaccine models containing GM-CSF as an adjuvant caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature. Another finding showed that the presence of adjuvant is more important in T cell response rather than B cell. The vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study encouraged us to start the challenge test using infective SARS-CoV-2 viruses and our second version of gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates in humanized ACE2+ mice.","SIR KARAKUS, G.; Tastan, C.; Dilek Kancagi, D.; Yurtsever, B.; Tumentemur, G.; Demir, S.; Turan, R.

32,"Insights into the practical effectiveness of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from serologic data, a cohort study","Background: Virologic detection of SARS-CoV-2 through Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has limitations for surveillance. Serologic tests can be an important complementary approach. Objective: Assess the practical performance of RT-PCR based surveillance protocols, and the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Shenzhen, China. Design: Cohort study nested in a public health response. Setting: Shenzhen, China; January-May 2020. Participants: 880 PCR-negative close-contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 400 residents without known exposure (main analysis). Fifty-seven PCR-positive case contacts (timing analysis). Measurements: Virological testing by RT-PCR. Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in PCR-negative contacts 2-15 weeks after initial testing using total Ab ELISA. Rates of undetected infection, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of seropositive but PCR-negative individuals were assessed. Results: The adjusted seropositivity rate for total Ab among 880 PCR-negative close-contacts was 4.1% (95%CI, 2.9% to 5.7%), significantly higher than among residents without known exposure to cases (0.0%, 95%CI, 0.0% to 1.0%). PCR-positive cases were 8.0 times (RR; 95% CI, 5.3 to 12.7) more likely to report symptoms than the PCR-negative individuals who were seropositive, but otherwise similar. RT-PCR missed 36% (95%CI, 28% to 44%) of infected close-contacts, and false negative rates appear to be highly dependent on stage of infection. Limitations: No serological data were available on PCR-positive cases. Sample size was limited, and only 20% of PCR-negative contacts met inclusion criteria. Conclusion: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols may miss a significant proportion of infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties timing testing of asymptomatics for optimal sensitivity. Surveillance and control protocols relying on RT-PCR were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen.","Zhang, Z.; Bi, Q.; Fang, S.; Wei, L.; Wang, X.; He, J.; Wu, Y.; Liu, X.; Gao, W.; Zhang, R.; Su, Q.; Azman, A.; Lessler, J.; Zou, X.; Gong, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20182469v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20182469v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
33,A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, M.

34,The role of masks in reducing the risk of new waves of COVID-19 in low transmission settings: a modeling study,"Objectives: To evaluate the risk of a new wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a setting with ongoing low transmission, high mobility, and an effective test-and-trace system, under different assumptions about mask uptake. Design: We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low levels of community transmission. Setting: We calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020. Participants: None Intervention: From September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions (i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%). Main outcome measure: Probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks. Results: The policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis. Mandatory mask usage would reduce this to 6-9%. Conclusions: Mandating the use of masks in community settings would significantly reduce the risk of epidemic resurgence.","Stuart, R.

35,Development and validation of a multiplex bead based assay for the detection of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins,"Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining antibody status against SARS-CoV-2 in candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 infection in this population. There are multiple antibody tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but their performance varies according to their platforms and the antigenic targets, making interpretation of the results challenging. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses. This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex bead based antibody detection assay with the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to five distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The antibody response to these proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific as antibodies against four community coronaviruses do not cross-react. Assay configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients. This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting.","Bray, R.

Methods and Materials Two studies were employed. In study 1, nasal specimens and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens from 251 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=7 days from symptom onset [DSO]), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare the Veritor test to the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 PCR Assay (Lyra assay). In study 2, nasal specimens from 361 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=5 DSO), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare performance of the Veritor test to that of the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia test). Positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (PPA, NPA, and OPA, respectively) were the primary outcomes Results In study 1, the Veritor test had a PPA with the Lyra assay ranging from 81.8%-87.5% for the 0-1 through the 0-6 DSO ranges. In study 2, the Veritor test had a PPA, NPA, and OPA of 97.4%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively with the Sofia test. Discordant testing showed one Lyra positive missed by the Veritor test and five Lyra positives missed by Sofia; one Veritor positive result was negative by Lyra. Conclusions The Veritor test met FDA-EUA acceptance criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (>=80% PPA point estimate) for the 0-5 and 0-6 DSO ranges. In addition, the Veritor and Sofia tests showed a high degree of agreement for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

37,"The discovery of gene mutations making SARS-CoV-2 well adapted for humans: host-genome similarity analysis of 2594 genomes from China, the USA and Europe","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo . A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","Sun, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,False

In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 genomes full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

However, the immune response in mild or even asymptomatic patients remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2.

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by {gamma}S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of {gamma}S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2.

Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-gamma; and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 microgram and 10 microgram doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Childrens Hospital Colorado rapidly put into practice a CCP collection protocol, necessitating the development and implementation of assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CCP units. We evaluated 87 separate units of CCP collected from 36 donors over two to four sequential donations using both antigen-binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike antigens, and a live virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50). Our data shows that the majority of donors (83 percent) had a FRNT50 titer of 1/80 or greater, and 61 percent had a titer greater than or equal to 1/160, which meet the FDA criteria for acceptable CCP units. Additionally, our data indicates that analysis of antibodies to a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen is likely to miss a percentage of seroconverters. These individuals, however, tend to have neutralizing antibody titers of less than 1/80.

45,Mutation in position of 32 (G>U) of S2M differentiate human SARS-CoV2 from Bat Coronavirus,"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic pathogen that has rapidly mutated and become transmissible to humans. There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3'UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes.

46,Rapid 'mix and read' assay for scalable detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient plasma,"The human beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causative virus of COVID-19, has infected more than 15 million people globally and continues to spread. Widespread, population level testing to detect active and past infections is critical to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibody (serological) testing is the only option for detecting past infections outside the narrow window accessible to nucleic acid-based tests. However, currently available serological assays commonly lack scalability. Here, we describe the development of a rapid homogenous serological assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient plasma. We show that the fluorescence-based assay accurately detects seroconversion in COVID-19 patients from less than 1 microliter of plasma. Using a cohort of samples from COVID-19 infected or healthy individuals, we demonstrate detection with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This assay addresses an important need for a robust, low barrier to implementation, and scalable serological assay with complementary strengths to currently available serological platforms.","Yue, H.; Nowak, R.

47,Early elevation of FIB-4 liver fibrosis score is associated with adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19,"Background Limited prior data suggest that pre-existing liver disease was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. The association of FIB-4 with COVID-19 outcomes has not been previously evaluated. Methods FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. Results Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein). Conclusions FIB-4 at early-stage of COVID-19 disease had an independent and dose-dependent association with adverse outcomes during hospitalization. FIB-4 provided significant prognostic value to adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients.","Xiang, F.; Sun, J.; Chen, P.-H.; Han, P.; Zheng, H.; Cai, S.; Kirk, G.

Clusters of infection occurred in staff working in wards with patients known to have COVID-19 infection. Staff infections peaked when COVID-19 infected inpatient numbers were highest, and density of patients and certain patient behaviours were noted by staff to be linked to possible transmission events. Three small outbreaks on other wards occurred but all were recognised and brought under control. Availability of rapid turn-around staff testing, and regular review of local data and obtaining feedback from staff helped identify useful interventions which were iteratively implemented. Attention to staff wellbeing was critical to the response and a comprehensive support service was implemented. Conclusion(s): A comprehensive multimodal approach to containment was instituted with iterative refinement based on frontline workers observations and ongoing analysis of local data in real time.","Buising, K.; Williamson, D.; Cowie, B.; MacLachlan, J.; Orr, L.; MacIsaac, C.; Williams, E.; Bond, K.; Muhi, S.; McCarthy, J.; Maier, A.; Irving, L.; Heinjus, D.; Kelly, C.; Marshall, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186452v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20186452v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,True
49,Equivalent SARS-CoV-2 viral loads between nasopharyngeal swab and saliva in symptomatic patients,"COVID-19 is diagnosed by detecting SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Emerging evidences have shown the utility of saliva, although conflicting results have been reported regarding viral loads between NPS and saliva. We conducted a study to compare the viral loads in 42 patients with COVID-19. Both NPS and saliva specimens were simultaneously obtained at a median of 6 days (range, 1-12) after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 34 (81%) using NPS (median Ct value [IQR]=27.4 [21.3, 35.6]) and 38 (90%) using saliva (median Ct value [IQR]= 28.9 [23.1, 33.6]). There was no significance difference between them (Wilcoxon signed rank test: P=0.79) and Kendall's W was 0.82, showing a high degree of agreement, indicating equivalent viral loads in NPS and saliva. After symptom onset, the Ct values of both NPS and saliva continued to increase over time, with no substantial difference. Self-collected saliva has a detection sensitivity comparable to that of NPS and is a useful diagnostic tool with mitigating uncomfortable process and the risk of aerosol transmission to healthcare workers.","Yokota, I.; Hattori, T.; Shane, P.

50,SARS-CoV-2 causes severe alveolar inflammation and barrier dysfunction,"Infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Böttcher, S.; Häring, C.; Giebeler, L.; Henke, A.; Zell, R.; Hornung, F.; Brandt, C.; Marquet, M.; Mosig, A.

51,Induction of a regulatory myeloid program in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19,"A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis1. To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5-8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reyes, M.; Filbin, M.

52,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with a human intestine-on-chip device,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","Guo, Y.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Deng, P.; Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Zhang, X.; Cui, K.; Tao, T.; Li, Z.; Chen, W.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1,2020-09-02,2020-09-02,,False
53,Structural Variants in SARS-CoV-2 Occur at Template-Switching Hotspots,"The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in ""arms"" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.","Chrisman, B.; Paskov, K.; Stockham, N.; Tabatabaei, K.; Jung, J.-Y.; Washington, P.; Varma, M.; Woo Sun, M.; Maleki, S.; Wall, D.

54,Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness and neutralization susceptibility,"A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an ""up"" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.

ImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.","Plante, J. A.; Liu, Y.; Liu, J.; Xia, H.; Johnson, B.

55,Optimizing direct RT-LAMP to detect transmissible SARS-CoV-2 from primary patient samples,"SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US. Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed samples, albeit with approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. We demonstrate that adding lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Overall, the limit of detection (LOD) of RT-LAMP using direct nasopharyngeal swab or saliva samples without RNA extraction is 1x105-1x106 copies/ml. This LOD is sufficient to detect samples from which infectious virus can be cultured. Therefore, samples that test positive in this assay contain levels of virus that are most likely to perpetuate transmission. Furthermore, purified RNA achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 screening programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.","Dudley, D.

However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, H.-X.; Juno, J. A.; Lee, W.

57,An intestinal cell type in zebrafish is the nexus for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contributes to COVID-19 comorbidities,"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

58,Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms,"The zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. Animal experiments have shown that non-human primates, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits and bats can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. We also describe the first animal to human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms.

59,Modeling Dynamic Network Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Control on a Cruise Ship,"SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, passenger-crew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for outbreak prevention included early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100% sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Public health restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely available.","Jenness, S.

60,A versatile reporter system to monitor virus infected cells and its application to dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, F.; Neufeldt, C.

61,Characterization of neutralizing versus binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India,"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses. These finding have timely significance for selection of appropriate individuals as donors for plasma intervention strategies, as well as determining vaccine efficacy.","Nayak, K.; Gottimukkala, K.; Kumar, S.; Reddy, E.

62,"Engineered Trimeric ACE2 Binds and Locks ""Three-up"" Spike Protein to Potently Inhibit SARS-CoVs and Mutants","SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE-2, which binds the spike protein with moderate affinity. Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. The cryo-EM structure reveals that T-ACE2 can induce the transit of spike protein to ""three-up"" RBD conformation upon binding. T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.","Guo, L.; Bi, W.; Wang, X.; Xu, W.; Yan, R.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, K.; Li, Y.; Zhang, M.; Bao, X.; Cai, X.; Li, Y.; Qu, D.; Jiang, S.; Xie, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Lu, L.; Dang, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1,2020-09-01,2020-09-01,,False
63,A longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients shows high correlation between neutralizing antibodies and COVID-19 severity,"Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection from re-infection and, thus, for public health policy and for vaccine development against the COVID-19. Here, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum specimens from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed patients, including patient with mild symptoms but also more severe form including those that require intensive care. We show that nAb titers were strongly correlated with disease severity and with anti-Spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers, whereas patients with milder disease symptoms displayed heterogenous nAb titers and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient care patients had no or poor nAb levels. We found that the nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery, as compared to individuals infected with alternative coronaviruses. We show the absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAb against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which has recently been identified as the major variant now found in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the immune correlate of SARS-CoV-2 induced disease and claim for a rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Legros, V.; Denolly, S.; Vogrig, M.; Boson, B.; Rigaill, J.; Pillet, S.; Grattard, F.; Gonzalo, S.; Verhoeven, P.; Allatif, O.; Berthelot, P.; Pelissier, C.; Thierry, G.; Botelho-Nevers, E.; Paul, S.; Walzer, T.; Cosset, F.-L.; Bourlet, T.; Pozzetto, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182493v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20182493v1?rss=1,2020-09-01,2020-09-01,,True
64,Drug repurposing screen identifies masitinib as a 3CLpro inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Drayman, N.; Jones, K.

65,Potential reduction in transmission of COVID-19 by digital contact tracing systems,"Digital tools are being developed to support contact tracing as part of the global effort to control the spread of COVID-19. These include smartphone apps, Bluetooth-based proximity detection, location tracking, and automatic exposure notification features. Evidence on the effectiveness of alternative approaches to digital contact tracing is so far limited. We use an age-structured branching process model of the transmission of COVID-19 in different settings to estimate the potential of manual contact tracing and digital tracing systems to help control the epidemic. We investigate the effect of the uptake rate and proportion of contacts recorded by the digital system on key model outputs: the effective reproduction number, the mean outbreak size after 30 days, and the probability of elimination. We show that effective manual contact tracing can reduce the effective reproduction number from 2.4 to around 1.5. The addition of a digital tracing system with a high uptake rate over 75% could further reduce the effective reproduction number to around 1.1. Fully automated digital tracing without manual contact tracing is predicted to be much less effective. We conclude that, for digital tracing systems to make a significant contribution to the control of COVID-19, they need be designed in close conjunction with public health agencies to support and complement manual contact tracing by trained professionals.","Plank, M.

66,Tocilizumab in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is associated with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody. METHODS Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standard care were randomized (2:1) to double-blinded intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo. The primary outcome measure was clinical status on a 7-category ordinal scale at day 28 (1, discharged/ready for discharge; 7, death). RESULTS Overall, 452 patients were randomized; the modified-intention-to-treat population included 294 tocilizumab-treated and 144 placebo-treated patients. Clinical status at day 28 was not statistically significantly improved for tocilizumab versus placebo (P=0.36). Median (95% CI) ordinal scale values at day 28: 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0) for tocilizumab and 2.0 (1.0 to 4.0) for placebo (odds ratio, 1.19 [0.81 to 1.76]). There was no difference in mortality at day 28 between tocilizumab (19.7%) and placebo (19.4%) (difference, 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]; nominal P=0.94). Median time to hospital discharge was 8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (20.0 and 28.0, respectively; nominal P=0.037; hazard ratio 1.35 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.79]). Median duration of ICU stay was 5.8 days shorter with tocilizumab than placebo (9.8 and 15.5, respectively; nominal P=0.045). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 34.9% of 295 patients in the tocilizumab arm and 38.5% of 143 in the placebo arm. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, tocilizumab did not improve clinical status or mortality.

68,SalivaAll: Clinical validation of a sensitive test for saliva collected in healthcare and community settings with pooling utility for SARS-CoV-2 mass surveillance.,"Background: The adoption of saliva as a specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 mass surveillance can significantly increase population compliance with decreased exposure risk for healthcare workers. However, studies evaluating the clinical performance of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples have demonstrated conflicting results regardless of the collection being in healthcare or community settings. Further, pooled testing with saliva remains a challenge owing to the ambiguous sensitivity, limit of detection (LoD), and processing challenges. To overcome these limitations, SalivaAll protocol was developed and validated as a cost-effective measure that must be used on saliva collected in health care or community settings with pooling utility for SARS-CoV-2 mass surveillance. Methods: The study evaluated 429 matched NPS and saliva samples collected from 344 individuals in either healthcare or community setting. In phase I (protocol U), 240 matched NPS, and saliva samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR. In phase II (SalivaAll protocol), 189 matched NPS and saliva samples were tested, with an additional sample homogenization step for saliva before RNA extraction, followed by RT-PCR. Eighty-five saliva samples were evaluated with both protocols (U and SalivaAll). Subsequently, adopting SalivaAll protocol, a five-sample pooling strategy was evaluated for saliva samples based on FDA recommendations. Results: In phase I, 28.3% (68/240) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from either saliva, NPS, or both. The detection rate was lower in saliva compared to NPS samples (50.0% vs. 89.7%). In phase II, 50.2% (95/189) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from either saliva, NPS, or both. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (97.8% vs. 78.9%). Of the 85 saliva samples evaluated by both protocols, 57.6% (49) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with either protocol U, SalivaAll, or both. The detection rate was 100% for samples tested with SalivaAll, whereas it was 36.7% with protocol U. Also, the LoD with SalivaAll protocol was 20 copies/ml. The pooled testing approach demonstrated a 95% positive and 100% negative percent agreement. Conclusion: This single-site study demonstrated the variability of results reported in the literature for saliva samples, and found that the discrepancies are explained by processing challenges associated with saliva samples. We have optimized a protocol for saliva samples that results in higher sensitivity compared to NPS samples and also breaks the barrier to using pooled saliva testing for SARS-CoV-2.","Sahajpal, N.

69,Methylene Blue Inhibits In Vitro the SARS-CoV-2 Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction - A Mechanism That Can Contribute to Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19,"Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 M) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","Bojadzic, D.; Alcazar, O.; Buchwald, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,False

Given literature suggesting a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes induction, we examined pancreatic expression of the key molecule for SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNAseq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated pancreatic expression of ACE2 is prominent in pancreatic ductal epithelium and the microvasculature, with rare endocrine cell expression of this molecule. Pancreata from COVID-19 patients demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein expression primarily limited to ducts.

71,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are Expressed in the Pancreas but Not in Islet Endocrine Cells,"Summary/AbstractReports of new-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with COVID-19 have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is directly cytotoxic to pancreatic islet {beta} cells. This model would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells via cell surface co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the putative receptor and effector protease, respectively. To define ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the human pancreas, we examined six transcriptional datasets from primary human islet cells and assessed protein expression by immunofluorescence in pancreata from donors with and without diabetes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts were low or undetectable in pancreatic islet endocrine cells as determined by bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and neither protein was detected in  or {beta} cells from any of these donors. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in the islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and also found in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. The absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in islet endocrine cells makes it unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 directly affects pancreatic islet {beta} cells.","Coate, K.

74,Interplay of antibody and cytokine production reveals CXCL-13 as a potential novel biomarker of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to impact the global population. This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the systemic cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production to Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike S1 subunit (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 develops over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens, 86%) suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age were all associated with differences in antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 antigens which may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the production of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients over the course of infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18) and chemotactic markers (IP-10, SDF-1, MIP-1{beta}, MCP-1, and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, RANTES, TNF-, GRO-, and MIP-1 relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients that succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. Furthermore, patients that succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and also tended to have high ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies.

75,A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses,"There is dire need for an effective and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","Tan, T.

76,Viral shedding and immunological features of children COVID-19 patients,"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 could infect people at all ages, and the viral shedding and immunological features of children COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Methods Epidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35 children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines. Results 40% (14/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32/35, 91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10, IFN-2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o. Conclusion COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.","Yang, Y.; Zheng, H.; Peng, L.; Wei, J.; Wang, Y.; Li, X.; Peng, B.; Fang, S.; Zhang, M.; Liu, H.; Li, Y.; Feng, K.; Xing, L.; Wang, J.; Cao, M.; Wang, F.; Liu, Y.; Liu, L.; Yuan, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181446v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,True

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic.

78,"SARS-CoV-2 infects human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, impairing electrical and mechanical function","Global health has been threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)1. Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease2-4. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities3,5-9. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. Long-term cardiac complications might be possible sequelae in patients who recover from this illness.","Marchiano, S.; Hsiang, T.-Y.; Higashi, T.; Kanna, A.; Reinecke, H.; Yang, X.; Pabon, L.; Sniadecki, N.

Of particular note, 2019nCoVR performs systematic analyses to generate a dynamic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations at a global scale. It provides all identified variants and detailed statistics for each virus isolate, and congregates the quality score, functional annotation, and population frequency for each variant. It also generates visualization of the spatiotemporal change for each variant and yields historical viral haplotype network maps for the course of the outbreak from all complete and high-quality genomes. Moreover, 2019nCoVR provides a full collection of SARS-CoV-2 relevant literature on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), including published papers from PubMed as well as preprints from services such as bioRxiv and medRxiv through Europe PMC. Furthermore, by linking with relevant databases in CNCB-NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers data submission services for raw sequence reads and assembled genomes, and data sharing with National Center for Biotechnology Information.

80,Structure-Altering Mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Frame Shifting RNA Element,"With the rapid rate of Covid-19 infections and deaths, treatments and cures besides hand washing, social distancing, masks, isolation, and quarantines are urgently needed. The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, ""RAG"" (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.

SIGNIFICANCESince the outbreak of Covid-19, numerous projects were launched to discover drugs and vaccines. Compared to protein-focused approaches, targeting the RNA genome, especially highly conserved crucial regions, can destruct the virus life cycle more fundamentally and avoid problems of viral mutations. We choose to target the small frame-shifting element (FSE) embedded in the Open Reading Frame 1a,b of SARS-CoV-2. This FSE is essential for translating overlapping reading frames and thus controlling the viral protein synthesis pathway. By applying graph-theory-based computational algorithms, we identify structurally crucial residues in the FSE as potential targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing.","Schlick, T.; Zhu, Q.; Jain, S.; Yan, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1,2020-08-30,2020-08-30,,False
81,Structural classification of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain suggests vaccine and therapeutic strategies,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to ""up"" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only ""up"" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent ""down"" RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, C.

83,Silicon Nitride Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected.

MaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay.

ResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure.

ConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on Si3N4 may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","Lehman, C.

84,Establishment of murine hybridoma cells producing antibodies against spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,"In 2020 the world faced the pandemic of COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","Antipova, N.

85,The SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is not essential in vitro or in vivo in humans.,"SARS-CoV-2 genome annotation revealed the presence of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), of which the last one (ORF10) is positioned downstream the N gene. It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is a growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region.

Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was not hampered. Also in vitro, the strains replicated similarly, as the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","Pancer, K.; Milewska, A.; Owczarek, K.; Dabrowska, A.; Branicki, W.; Sanak, M.; Pyrc, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1,2020-08-29,2020-08-29,,False
86,Single-cell analysis of human trophoblast stem cell specification reveals activation of fetal cytotrophoblast expression programs including coronavirus associated host factors and human endogenous retroviruses,"The human placenta is increasingly a focus of research related to early child development and the impact of maternal hyperimmune states. The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","Tietze, E.; Barbosa, A. R.; Euclydes, V.; Cho, H.

87,Global BioID-based SARS-CoV-2 proteins proximal interactome unveils novel ties between viral polypeptides and host factors involved in multiple COVID19-associated mechanisms,"The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses a serious challenge to human societies and economies. SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","Laurent, E.

Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.

Except three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.

As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, P.; Turuk, J.; Behera, S.

90,Identification of 14 Known Drugs as Inhibitors of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2,"A consensus virtual screening protocol has been applied to ca. 2000 approved drugs to seek inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. 42 drugs emerged as top candidates, and after visual analyses of the predicted structures of their complexes with Mpro, 17 were chosen for evaluation in a kinetic assay for Mpro inhibition. Remarkably 14 of the compounds at 100-M concentration were found to reduce the enzymatic activity and 5 provided IC50 values below 40 M: manidipine (4.8 M), boceprevir (5.4 M), lercanidipine (16.2 M), bedaquiline (18.7 M), and efonidipine (38.5 M). Structural analyses reveal a common cloverleaf pattern for the binding of the active compounds to the P1, P1, and P2 pockets of Mpro. Further study of the most active compounds in the context of COVID-19 therapy is warranted, while all of the active compounds may provide a foundation for lead optimization to deliver valuable chemotherapeutics to combat the pandemic.","Ghahremanpour, M.

92,Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in household and community settings in the United Kingdom,"Background: Households appear to be the highest risk setting for transmission of COVID-19. Large household transmission studies were reported in the early stages of the pandemic in Asia with secondary attack rates ranging from 5-30% but few large scale household transmission studies have been conducted outside of Asia. Methods: A prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol was undertaken in the UK following the detection of the first case in late January 2020. Household contacts of cases were followed using enhanced surveillance forms to establish whether they developed symptoms of COVID-19, became confirmed cases and their outcomes. Household secondary attack rates and serial intervals were estimated. Individual and household basic reproduction numbers were also estimated. The incubation period was estimated using known point source exposures that resulted in secondary cases. Results: A total of 233 households with two or more people were included with a total of 472 contacts. The overall household SAR was 37% (95% CI 31-43%) with a mean serial interval of 4.67 days, an R0 of 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33. We find lower secondary attack rates in larger households. SARs were highest when the primary case was a child. We estimate a mean incubation period of around 4.5 days. Conclusions: High rates of household transmission of COVID-19 were found in the UK emphasising the need for preventative measures in this setting. Careful monitoring of schools reopening is needed to monitor transmission from children.","Lopez Bernal, J.; Panagiotopoulos, N.; Byers, C.; Garcia Vilaplana, T.; Boddington, N.

93,This time is different: model-based evaluation of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics for disease control,"As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic passes from an acute to a chronic situation, countries and territories are grappling with the issue of how to reopen safely. The unique kinetics of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020) to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.","Johnson, K.

95,"Decontaminating N95 respirators during the Covid-19 pandemic: simple and practical approaches to increase decontamination capacity, speed, safety and ease of use.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed. Aims: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or moisturizers. Methods: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. Findings: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. Conclusions: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","RUSSO, R.; Levine, C.; Veilleux, C.; Peixoto, B.; McCormick-Ell, J.; Block, T.; Gresko, A.; Delmas, G.; Chitale, P.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20177022v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20177022v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True

97,Look before diving into pooling of SARS-CoV-2 samples on high throughput analyzers,"Given the unprecedented demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of specimen pooling have recently been explored. As previous studies were limited to mathematical modeling or testing on low throughput PCR instruments, this study aimed to assess pooling on high throughput analyzers. To assess the impact of pooling, SARS-CoV-2 dilutions were performed at varying pool depths (i.e. 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) into test-negative nasopharyngeal or oropharynx/anterior nares swabs matrix. Testing was evaluated on the automated Roche Cobas 6800 system, or the Roche MagNApure LC 2.0 or MagNAPure 96 instruments paired with a laboratory-developed test using a 96-well PCR format. The frequency of detection in specimens with low viral loads was evaluated using archived specimens collected throughout the first pandemic wave. The proportion of detectable results per pool depths was used to estimate the potential impact. In addition, workflow at the analytical stage, and pre-and post-stages of testing were also considered. The current study estimated that pool depths of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 would have allowed the detection of 98.3%, 96.0%, and 92.6% of positive SARS-CoV-2 results identified in the first wave of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. Overall, this study demonstrated that pooling on high throughput instrumentation can dramatically increase the overall testing capacity to meet increased demands, with little compromising to sensitivity at low pool depths. However, the human resources required at the pre-analytical stage of testing is a particular challenging to achieve.","LeBlanc, J.

98,Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells and genomic mutational analysis of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","Friedman, N.; Jacob-Hirsch, J.; Drori, Y.; Eyal, E.; Kol, N.; Nayshool, O.; Mendelson, E.; Rechavi, G.; Mandelboim, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
99,Decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses from N95 level meltblown polypropylene fabric using heat under different humidities,"In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic led to a shortage of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), especially for protection of healthcare professionals against airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95{degrees}C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75{degrees}C for 30 min or 85{degrees}C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181 (CHIKV-181), without lowering the meltblown fabric's filtration efficiency.","Campos, R.
