0,Indirect Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Activity and Outcomes of Transcatheter and Surgical Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis in England,"Background Aortic stenosis requires timely treatment with either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on national SAVR and TAVR activity and outcomes. Methods The UK TAVR Registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit were used to identify all TAVR and SAVR procedures in England, between January 2017 and June 2020. The number of isolated AVR, AVR+coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, AVR+other surgery and TAVR procedures per month was calculated. Separate negative binomial regression models were fit to monthly procedural counts, with functions of time as covariates, to estimate the expected change in activity during COVID-19. Results We included 13376 TAVR cases, 12328 isolated AVR cases, 7829 AVR+CABG cases, and 6014 AVR+Other cases. Prior to March 2020 (UK lockdown), monthly TAVR activity was rising, with a slight decrease in SAVR activity during 2019. We observed a rapid and significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for elective cases. Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, we estimated an expected 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis who have not received treatment. Conclusion This study has demonstrated a significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR activity in England following the COVID-19 outbreak. This situation should be monitored closely, to ensure that monthly activity rapidly returns to expected levels. There is potential for significant backlog in the near-to-medium term, and potential for increased mortality in this population.","Martin, G.

1,Time to negative PCR from symptom onset in COVID-19 patients on Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin - A real world experience,"Background: The role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is not known. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study to assess the effect of HCQ and Azithromycin on duration from symptom onset to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR using nasopharyngeal swab in hospitalized patient with COVID-19. Eighty-five patients were included in the study, 65 in HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and 20 in non-HCQ group. Measurement of duration from symptom onset to negative PCR and effect of gender, age and disease severity on time to viral clearance was measured. Results: Median time to negative PCR in HCQ group was 23 days (IQR: 9, Mean 24+8, N=65) compared with non-HCQ group, 19 days (IQR: 8, Mean 18+6, N=20), (p <0.05). Forty-one (63%) patients in HCQ group and all patients (100%) in non-HCQ group had mild disease. Multivariate regression model (F=6.8, P<0.002, R2=0.20) shows that being in HCQ group would delay the time to negative PCR by 7 days (95%CI: 2-12) and with every year increase in the age, the time to negative PCR would be delayed by 0.12 days (95%CI: 0.017-0.22). Among HCQ sub-groups, gender and disease severity had no effect on duration (p 0.142 and 0.156 respectively) but older patients >60 year had longer duration compared to patients <60 year of age although p value did not reach significance (p 0.073). Median time to negative PCR in mild-HCQ group (23 days, IQR: 9, Mean 23+8, N=41) was longer when compared with non-HCQ group (p <0.05). On day 28, all patients in non-HCQ group had negative PCR while only 50/65 (77%) were negative in HCQ group. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin delay SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and it is correlated with older age. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Saleemi, S.

2,COVID-19 and Mental Health: A Study of its Impact on Students,"The purpose of this study was to identify and analyse the personal, social and psychological impact of COVID - 19 on the mental health of students of age group 16 to 25. A response from N= 351 students (from the most affected state in India), provided a comparative analysis based on the gender, and background to understand the pattern in issues related to mental health during the pandemic. The results show that female students are more concerned about health, and future, and are more prone to psychological issues like feelings of uncertainty, helplessness and outbursts than male students. Urban student population is more mentally affected than their rural counterparts, however time spent on the internet is almost the same despite the difference in infrastructure and resources. Also, there is an increase in need for solitude, being withdrawn and self-harm in male students require attention. A shift in perception from seeing family as a source of support to that of a restriction is indicated, although the benefits of a collectivist society are undisputed. The results indicate that there is overall increased awareness about mental health among the student population and with programs/strategies focusing on background and gender, a significant improvement is attainable.","Moghe, K.; Kotecha, D.; Patil, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20160499v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20160499v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,True
3,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rabies reemergence in Latin America: the case of Arequipa, Peru","Over the past decades, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies in Latin America. Major components of rabies prevention programs in Latin America leading to these successes have been constant and intense surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. However, vital measures to control COVID-19 in Latin America have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. In this paper, we aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics parameterized for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, where there is an ongoing dog rabies epidemic. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance leading to an increased length of survival of infected dogs could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies and, subsequently, human rabies risk. We examined our results over the best estimate of the basic reproductive number in Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) and a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36 - 2). The rising trend was consistent. It is very possible that COVID-19 will continue to challenge our public health departments in the short- and medium-term. Innovative strategies to conduct dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during these trying times should be considered to safeguard the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies. Resumen (Abstract in Spanish) En las ultimas decadas ha habido un tremendo progreso hacia la eliminacion de la rabia canina en America Latina. Los principales componentes de los programas de prevencion de la rabia en America Latina que condujeron a estos exitos han sido la vigilancia constante e intensa de los perros con rabia y las campanas anuales de vacunacion masiva ininterrumpida. Sin embargo, las medidas esenciales para controlar el COVID-19 en America Latina han tenido el balance negativo de poner en peligro estas actividades de prevencion y eliminacion de rabia. En este articulo, nuestro objetivo fue evaluar el efecto que la interrupcion de la vigilancia de la rabia canina y las campanas de vacunacion masiva de perros tendria en las tendencias de la rabia. Modelamos la dinamica de la rabia canina mediante un modelo deterministico de comportamientos parametrizado para las condiciones que se encuentran en Arequipa, Peru, donde hay una epidemia de rabia canina en curso. Nuestro modelo sugiere que una disminucion en la cobertura de vacunacion canina, asi como una disminucion en la vigilancia (que llevaria a una mayor supervivencia de los perros infectados), podria llevar a un aumento subito de rabia canina y, seguidamente, del riesgo de rabia humana. Examinamos nuestros resultados sobre la mejor estimacion del numero reproductivo basico en Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) y un rango de valores plausibles para R0 (1.36 - 2). La tendencia al alza fue consistente. Es muy posible que el COVID-19 continue desafiando a nuestros departamentos de salud publica a corto y mediano plazo. Por lo tanto, deben considerarse estrategias innovadoras para llevar a cabo la vacunacion de perros y la vigilancia de la rabia durante estos tiempos dificiles para salvaguardar los logros alcanzados en America Latina hacia la eliminacion de la rabia humana mediada por perros.","Raynor, B.; Diaz, E.

4,Model to Describe Fast Shutoff of CoVID-19 Pandemic Spread,"Early CoVID-19 growth obeys: N{t*}=N/I exp[+K/o t*], with K/o = [(ln 2) / (t/dbl)], where t/dbl is the pandemic growth doubling time. Given N{t*}, the daily number of new CoVID-19 cases is {rho}{t*}=dN{t*}/dt*. Implementing society-wide Social Distancing increases the t/dbl doubling time, and a linear function of time for t/dbl was used in our Initial Model: N/o[t] = 1 exp[+K/A t / (1 + {gamma}/o t) ] = exp(+G/o) exp( - Z/o[t] ) , to describe these changes, with G/o = [K/A / {gamma}/o]. However, this equation could not easily model some quickly decreasing {rho}[t] cases, indicating that a second Social Distancing process was involved. This second process is most evident in the initial CoVID-19 data from China, South Korea, and Italy. The Italy data is analyzed here in detail as representative of this second process. Modifying Z/o[t] to allow exponential cutoffs: Z/E[t] = +[G/o / (1 + {gamma}/o t) ] [exp( - {delta}/o t - q/o t^2 ] = Z/o[t] [exp( - {delta}/o t - q/o t^2 ] , provides a new Enhanced Initial Model (EIM), which significantly improves datafits, where N/E[t] = exp(+G/o) exp( - Z/E[t] ). Since large variations are present in {rho}/data[t], these models were generalized into an orthogonal function series, to provide additional data fitting parameters: N(Z) = Sum{m = (0, M/F)} g/m L/m(Z) exp[-Z]. Its first term can give N/o[t] or N/E[t], for Z=Z/o[t] or Z=Z/E[t]. The L/m(Z) are Laguerre Polynomials, with L/0(Z)=1, and {g/m; m= (0, M/F)} are constants derived from each dataset. When {rho}[t]=dN[t]/dt gradually decreases, using Z/o[t] provided good datafits at small M/F values, but was inadequate if {rho}[t] decreased faster. For those cases, Z/E[t] was used in the above N(Z) series to give the most general Enhanced Orthogonal Function [EOF] model developed here. Even with M/F=0 and q/o=0, this EOF model fit the Italy CoVID-19 data for {rho}[t] = dN[t]/dt fairly well. When the {rho}[t] post-peak behavior is not Gaussian, then Z/E[t] with {delta}/o=0, q/o=0; which we call Z/A[t], is also likely to be a sufficient extension of the Z/o[t] model. The EOF model also can model a gradually decreasing {rho}[t] tail using small {{delta}/o, q/o} values [with 6 Figures].","Eng, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169904v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20169904v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,True
5,"Expanding COVID-19 symptom screening to retail, restaurants, and schools by preserving privacy using relaxed digital signatures","Symptom screening is a widely deployed strategy to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and many public health authorities are mandating its use by employers for all employees in the workplace. While symptom screening has the benefit of reducing the number of infected individuals in the workplace, it raises some inherently difficult privacy issues as a traditional approach requires the employer to collect symptom data from each employee which is essentially medical information. In this paper, we describe a system to implement Cryptographic Anonymous Symptom Screening (CASS) which allows for individuals to perform COVID symptom screening anonymously while avoiding the privacy issues of traditional approaches. In the system, individuals report their symptoms without any identifying information and are issued a completion certificate. This certificate contains a cryptographic code which certifies that the certificate was obtained from the screener after reporting no symptoms. The codes can be verified using a cryptographic algorithm which is publicly available. A standard cryptography approach to implement such a system would be to use digital signatures. Unfortunately, standard digital signatures have some limitations for this application in that the signatures are often hundreds of characters long and if the signature contains the name of the individual, then there is also a risk of compromising privacy. In our approach, we develop and utilize a relaxed digital signature scheme to provide 16 character long codes and handle names using equivalence classes which helps preserve privacy. Both of these extensions technically compromise the security but in a way that is negligible for this application. Our system can either serve the function of standard symptom screening system approaches for employees, but can also extend symptom screening to non-employees such as visitors or customers. In this case, the system can be utilized in retail, restaurants and schools to ensure that everyone in the physical space, including employees, customers, visitors and students have performed symptom screening.","Jew, B.; Korb, A.; Lou, P.; Chiang, J.

6,Quantifying threat from COVID-19 infection hazard in Primary Schools in England,"We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model input parameters. The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools re-open fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","Sparks, S. R.; Aspinall, W.

7,"Beneficial effects of colchicine for moderate to severe COVID-19: an interim analysis of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial","Introduction. Neutrophilia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation are common finds in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. By its action on leukocytes, we propose colchicine as an intervention worthy of being tested. Objective. To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [&ge;] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died. At day 4, patients of Colchicine group presented significant reduction of serum C-reactive protein compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The majority of adverse events were mild and did not lead to patient withdrawal. Diarrhea was more frequent in the Colchicine group (p = 0.17). Cardiac adverse events were absent. Discussion. The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment. Clinical trials with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine as an adjunctive therapy for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.","Lopes, M.

8,Whole Care Home Testing for Covid-19 in a Local Authority Area in the United Kingdom,"Objectives: To describe the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes reporting low numbers of cases of COVID-19. Design: A cross-sectional study of care homes, ascertaining perceived disease burden using interviews with care home managers and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in residents and staff using nose and throat swabbing. Setting: 15 Care homes in Essex, United Kingdom, all of which had reported either zero or one case of COVID-19 to the Health Protection Team. Participants: 912 residents and staff of care homes were tested. Residents were eligible to be tested regardless of symptoms. Main outcome measure: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in residents and staff. Results: In the 15 care homes studied, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 23 (5.2%)of 441 residents. Of these 23, 21/23 (91%) were asymptomatic as reported by the care home managers. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 8/471 (1.7%) of staff. This differs from that in residents (p=0.003). Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that symptoms, as reported by care home managers, are an insensitive method of defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes. Viral detection from residents is more common than from staff. Microbiological screening is a more sensitive method for defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes than managerial reporting of resident symptoms.","Starling, A.; White, E.; Showell, D.; Wyllie, D.; Kapadia, S.; Balakrishnan, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20162859v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20162859v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,True

We compared these results with functional neutralization activity using a fluorescent reporter strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a microwell assay. This revealed positive correlations of varying strength (Spearman r = 0.37-0.52) between binding and neutralization. Donors age 48-75 had the highest neutralization activity.

10,DC/L-SIGN recognition of spike glycoprotein promotes SARS-CoV-2 trans-infection and can be inhibited by a glycomimetic antagonist,"The efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a pandemic that is unique in modern history. Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection. Early involvement of APCs opens new avenues for understanding and treating the imbalanced innate immune response observed in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Thepaut, M.; Luczkowiak, J.; Vives, C.; Labiod, N.; Bally, I.; Lasala, F.; Grimoire, Y.; Fenel, D.; Sattin, S.; Thielens, N.; Schoehn, G.; Bernardi, A.; Delgado, R.; Fieschi, F.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.242917v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.242917v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
11,High throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq next generation sequencing,"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","Bhoyar, R.

12,Nonstructural protein 1 of SARS-CoV-2 is a potent pathogenicity factor redirecting host protein synthesis machinery toward viral RNA.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3' region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.","Yuan, S.; Peng, L.; Park, J.

13,"Comparative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 binding (IgG, IgM, IgA) and neutralizing antibodies from human serum samples","A newly identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","Mazzini, L.; Martinuzzi, D.; Hyseni, I.; Lapini, G.; Benincasa, L.; Piu, P.; Trombetta, C.

14,Bi-paratopic and multivalent human VH domains neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting distinct epitopes within the ACE2 binding interface of Spike,"Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","Bracken, C.

15,Petabase-scale sequence alignment catalyses viral discovery,"Public sequence data represents a major opportunity for viral discovery, but its exploration has been inhibited by a lack of efficient methods for searching this corpus, which is currently at the petabase scale and growing exponentially. To address the ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and expand the known sequence diversity of viruses, we aligned pangenomes for coronaviruses (CoV) and other viral families to 5.6 petabases of public sequencing data from 3.8 million biologically diverse samples. To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, `Serratus`, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of CoV and CoV-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community (https://serratus.io). Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of CoV and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.","Edgar, R.

16,Sofosbuvir Terminated RNA is More Resistant to SARS-CoV-2 Proofreader than RNA Terminated by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2. We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase. Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells; additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity. Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jockusch, S.; Tao, C.; Li, X.; Chien, M.; Kumar, S.; Morozova, I.; Kalachikov, S.; Russo, J.

If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the functional virus proteins cannot form and the virus cannot replicate and assemble. Any compound that inhibits the 3CLpro is therefore a potential drug to end the pandemic. Here we show that the diffraction power of 3CLpro crystals is effectively destroyed by Ebselen. It appears that Ebselen may be a widely available, relatively cost effective way to eliminate the SARS coronavirus 2.","Malla, T.

18,An ultra-high affinity synthetic nanobody blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection by locking Spike into an inactive conformation,"Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","Schoof, M.; Faust, B.; Saunders, R.

20,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 deletion variants detected in a nosocomial cluster during routine genomic surveillance, Lyon, France","Through routine genomic surveillance of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (n=229 whole genome sequences), 2 different frameshifting deletions were newly detected in the open reading frame (ORF) 6, starting at the same position (27267). While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.","Queromes, G.; Destras, G.; Bal, A.; Regue, H.; Burfin, G.; Brun, S.; Fanget, R.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Frobert, E.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
21,Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals That Some Mutations May Affect On Both Spike Structure Damage and Ligand Binding Site,"There are some mutations are known related to SARS-CoV-2. Together with these mutations known, we tried to show other newly mutations regionally.

Especially in Asia, more than one mutation (three different mutations are found in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) was seen in the same sequence. Although we detected a huge number of mutations (we found more than seventy in Asia) by regions, some of them were predicted that damage spike's protein structure by using bioinformatic tools. The predicted results are G75V (isolated from North America), T95I (isolated from South Korea), G143V (isolated from North America), M177I (isolated Asia), L293M (isolated from Asia), P295H (isolated from Asia), T393P (isolated from Europe), P507S (isolated from Asia), D614G (isolated from all regions) respectively. Also, in this study, we tried to show how possible binding sites of ligands change if the spike protein structure is damaged and whether more than one mutation affects ligand binding was estimated using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly, mutations that predicted to damage the structure do not affect ligand binding sites, whereas ligands' binding sites were affected in those with multiple mutations. Focusing on mutations may opens up the window to exploit new future therapeutic targets.","Aktas, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244632v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244632v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
22,SARS-CoV-2 and the Role of Orofecal Transmission: Systematic Review,"Background How SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is of key public health importance. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some Covid-19 patients which suggests the possibility that the virus could additionally be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of Covid-19. We conduct ongoing searches using LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and Google for Covid-19; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Where necessary authors are contacted for further details or clarification on the content of their articles. Results We found 59 studies: nine reviews and 51 primary studies or reports (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Half (n=29) were done in China. Thirty seven studies reported positive fecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results (n=1,034 patients). Six studies reported isolating the virus from fecal samples of nine patients, one study isolated the virus from rectal tissue and one laboratory study found that SARS-CoV-2 productively infected human small intestinal organoids. Eleven studies report on fecal samples found in sewage, and two sampled bathrooms and toilets. Conclusions Various observational and mechanistic evidence support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the human gastrointestinal tract.

23,A Classification Approach for Predicting COVID-19 Patient Survival Outcome with Machine Learning Techniques,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease discovered after the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. The virus has been escalated to many countries across the globe. This paper analyzed and compared the performance of three different supervised machine learning techniques; Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on COVID-19 dataset. The best level of accuracy between these three algorithms was determined by comparison of some metrics for assessing predictive performance such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, Kappa index, and ROC. From the analysis results, RF was found to be the best algorithm with 100% prediction accuracy in comparison with LDA and SVM with 95.2% and 90.9% respectively. Our analysis shows that out of these three classification models RF predicts COVID-19 patient's survival outcome with the highest accuracy. Chi-square test reveals that all the seven features except sex were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 patient's outcome (P-value < 0.005). Therefore, RF was recommended for COVID-19 patient outcome prediction that will help in early identification of possible sensitive cases for quick provision of quality health care, support and supervision.","Osi, A.

A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g/0.5 mL or 6 g /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay. RESULTS CoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules. CONCLUSIONS Favorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.","Zhang, Y.-J.; Zeng, G.; Pan, H.-X.; Li, C.-G.; Kan, B.; Hu, Y.-L.; Mao, H.-Y.; Xin, Q.-Q.; Chu, K.; Han, W.-X.; Chen, Z.; Tang, R.; Yin, W.-D.; Chen, X.; Gong, X.-J.; Qin, C.; Hu, Y.-S.; Liu, X.-Y.; Cui, G.-L.; Jiang, C.-B.; Zhang, H.-M.; Li, J.-X.; Yang, M.-N.; Lian, X.-J.; Song, Y.; Lu, J.-X.; Wang, X.-X.; Xu, M.; Gao, Q.; Zhu, F.-C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20161216v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,True

Thus, we passaged SARS-CoV-2 in defined conditions and determined its genomic adaptation dynamics. We demonstrate the presence of remarkably stable SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. We further show that the quasispecies nature of the virus population ensured rapid adaptation of the spike PRRARS motif upon passaging in Vero cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2 expressing cells led to a reverse mutation at the same site. We observed the emergence of novel mutations in envelope protein upon virus culture in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. Finally, we show that the heparan sulfate-binding motif (PRRARS) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein acted as a determinant of negative growth selection.

27,K18-hACE2 Mice for Studies of COVID-19 Treatments and Pathogenesis Including Anosmia,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","Perlman, S.; Zheng, J.; WONG, L.

28,Clinical and intestinal histopathological findings in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patients with hematochezia,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 in the form of anorexia,nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are usually preceeded by respiratory manifestations and are associated with a poor prognosis. Hematochezia is an uncommon clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease and we hypothesize that older patients with significant comorbidites (obesity and cardiovascular) and prolonged hospitalization are suspectible to ischemic injury to the bowel. We reviewed the clinical course, key laboratory data including acute phase reactants, drug/medication history in two elderly male patients admitted for COVID-19 respiratory failure. Both patients had a complicated clinical course and suffered from hematochezia and acute blood loss anemia requiring blood transfusion around day 40 of their hospitalization. Colonoscopic impressions were correlated with the histopathological findings in the colonic biopies and changes compatible with ischemia to nonspecific acute inflammation, edema and increased eosinophils in the lamina propria were noted.Both patients were on anticoagulants, multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents due to respiratory infections at the time of lower GI bleeding. Hematochezia resolved spontaneously with supportive care. Both patients eventually recovered and were discharged. Elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions are uniquely at risk for ischemic injury to the bowel. Hypoxic conditions due to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure, compounded by preexisting cardiovascular complications, and/or cytokine storm orchestrated by the viral infection leading to alteration in coagulation profile and/or drug/medication injury can be difficult to distinguish in these critically ill patients. Presentation of hematochezia may further increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients, and prompt consultation and management by gastroenterology is therefore warranted.","Cho, M.; Liu, W.; Balzora, S.; Suarez, Y.; Hoskoppal, D.; Theise, N.

30,SARS-CoV-2 and Stroke Characteristics: A Report from the Multinational COVID-19 Stroke Study Group,"Background: Stroke is reported as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is a lack of regarding comprehensive stroke phenotype and characteristics Methods: We conducted a multinational observational study on features of consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (CVST) among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. We further investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countrie's health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO; 10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria. We observed a lower median NIHSS (8[3-17], versus 11[5-17]; p=0.02) and higher rate of mechanical thrombectomy (12.4% versus 2%; p<0.001) in countries with middle to high-health expenditure when compared to countries with lower health expenditure. The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relatively large group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent among a relatively large cohort of patients. Among hospitalized patients, the stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanical thrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","Shahjouei, S.; Tsivgoulis, G.; Arora, R.; Harirchian, M.

31,Dynamics of neutralizing antibody titers in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Most individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop neutralizing antibodies that target the viral spike protein. Here we quantify how levels of these antibodies change in the months following SARS-CoV-2 infection by examining longitudinal samples collected between {approx}30 and 152 days post-symptom onset from a prospective cohort of 34 recovered individuals with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate-severe disease. Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about four-fold from one to four months post-symptom onset. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau. Additional studies of long-lived B-cells and antibody titers over longer time frames are necessary to determine the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Crawford, K. H.; Dingens, A.

33,Characterization of Israeli COVID-19 Outbreak Drivers and Forecasting Using a Versatile Web App,"Background. No versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to fully analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The NMB-DASA web app presented here fills this gap. Methods. Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies a contact class of individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic classes and a parallel set of response class, subject to lower contact pathogen contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file containing incidence and mortality time series. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a subset of these can be fitted to the model using an MLE algorithm. The end of model-fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allows counterfactual and forecasted scenarios to be explored. Findings. We illustrate the app in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, which can be divided into four distinct phases: an initial outbreak; a social distancing, a social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. Our projections beyond the relaxation phase indicate that an 85% drop in social relaxation rates are needed just to stabilize the current incidence rate and that at least a 95% drop is needed to quell the outbreak. Interpretation. Our analysis uses only incidence and mortality rates. In the hands of policy makers and health officers, we believe our web app provides an invaluable tool for evaluating the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.","Getz, W.

34,Aerosol Generation from Different Wind Instruments,"The potential airborne transmission of COVID-19 has raised significant concerns regarding the safety of musical activities involving wind instruments. However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","He, R.; Gao, L.; Trifonov, M.; Hong, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167833v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167833v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
35,mRNA induced expression of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in mice for the study of the adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting in nearly 20 million infections across the globe, as of August 2020. Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","Hassert, M.; Geerling, E.; Stone, E.

In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from donors with different physiological and pathological backgrounds such as smoking, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, or viral infections. By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic since the infection was first reported in China in December 2019. The aim of this study was to establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and to examine their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent, effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening of novel antiviral drug candidates.

38,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, neuropathogenesis and transmission among deer mice: Implications for reverse zoonosis to New World rodents","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in November, 2019 in China and rapidly became pandemic. As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.","Fagre, A.; Lewis, J.; Eckley, M.; Zhan, S.; Rocha, S.

39,Prediction of Covid-19 Infections Through December 2020 for 10 US States Using a Two Parameter Transmission Model Incorporating Outdoor Temperature and School Re-Opening Effects,"Covid-19 infection case predictions (total cases) are made for August through December 2020 for 10 US States (NY, WA, GA, IL, MN, FL, OH, MI, CA, and NC). A two-parameter model based on social distance index (SDI) and disease transmission efficiency (G) parameters is used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease spread. Current lack of coherent and coordinated US policy causes the US to follow a linear infection growth path with a limit cycle behavior that modulates the US between accelerating and decaying infection growth on either side of a linear growth path boundary. Four prediction cases are presented: 1) No school re-openings; fall season temperature effect 2) No school re-openings; no fall season temperature effect 3) School re-openings; fall season temperature effect 4) School re-openings; no fall season temperature effect Fall outdoor temperatures, in contrast to the 1918 pandemic, are predicted to be beneficial for dampening SARS-CoV-2 transmission in States as they pass through swing season temperature range of 70F to 50F. Physical re-opening of schools in September are predicted to accelerate infections. States with low current infectious case numbers (eg, NY) are predicted to be minimally impacted while States with high current infectious case numbers (eg, CA and FL) will be significantly impacted by school re-openings. Updated infection predictions will be posted monthly (Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec) with adjustments based on actual trends in SDI and G.

40,The association between lockdown due to COVID-19 epidemic and searches for toothache using Google Trends in Iran,"Objective: To assess the association between the lockdowns due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT). Methods: We investigated GT online searches for the search term   within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of lockdown in Iran. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to identify whether there is a statistical difference for RSV scores between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water with linear regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: When comparing 2020 with previous four years, there is a statistically significant difference between RSVs of 2020 with all previous years combined and each of these years (P<0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B=-3.29, 95% CI: (-5.80, -0.78), P=0.012), fluoride concentration (B=-0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.03), P=0.017), and prevalence of daily smokers (B=0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), P=0.002) were significantly associated with RSVs. These covariates were not statistically significant for other years, except for Internet access in 2016 (B=-1.13, 95% CI: (-2.26, 0.00), P=0.050). Conclusion: The RSVs for toothache in 2020 have significantly increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns compared to the same period of the year in the past four years. knowing that this period mostly overlaps with the national holidays of Nowruz in Iran, reinforces the impacts of lockdowns on people CSB about toothache.

41,Estimating the Changing Infection Rate of COVID-19 Using Bayesian Models of Mobility,"In order to prepare for and control the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic while minimizing its economic impact, the world needs to be able to estimate and predict COVID-19's spread. Unfortunately, we cannot directly observe the prevalence or growth rate of COVID-19; these must be inferred using some kind of model. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian extension to the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model that adds compartments to account for isolation and death and allows the infection rate to vary as a function of both mobility data collected from mobile phones and a latent time-varying factor that accounts for changes in behavior not captured by mobility data. Since confirmed-case data is unreliable, we infer the model's parameters conditioned on deaths data. We replace the exponential-waiting-time assumption of classic compartmental models with Erlang distributions, which allows for a more realistic model of the long lag between exposure and death. The mobility data gives us a leading indicator that can quickly detect changes in the pandemic's local growth rate and forecast changes in death rates weeks ahead of time. This is an analysis of observational data, so any causal interpretations of the model's inferences should be treated as suggestive at best; nonetheless, the model's inferred relationship between different kinds of trips and the infection rate do suggest some possible hypotheses about what kinds of activities might contribute most to COVID-19's spread.","Liu, L.; Vikram, S.; Lao, J.; Ben, X.; D'Amour, A.; O'Banion, S.; Sandler, M.; Saurous, R.

Methods: From April 23rd to May 8th 2020, we recruited a sample of participants from five sectors: healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal. We collected oropharyngeal swab for direct detection through real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and blood for antibodies detection by serological tests. The overall prevalence (current and past) of infection was defined by positivity for both tests. Results: A total of 955 participants with a median age of 36 (IQR 32-43) were included and 71.6% (n=684) were men. Around 22.1% (n=212) were from the air transport sector, 20.5% (n=196) in the police, and 38.7% (n=370) in the health sector. Seven participants (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6%) had a positive rRT-PCR at the time of recruitment and nine (0.9%, 95% CI: 0.4-1.8%) were seropositive for IgM or IgG against SARS-CoV-2.

43,Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and risk of COVID-19: a cohort analysis in the UK Biobank,"Objective To determine the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the risk of COVID-19. Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting UK Biobank population. Participants 421,048 participants who were recruited in England and alive by January 31st 2020, i.e., the start of COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. 50,815 individuals with psychiatric disorders recorded in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data before the outbreak were included in the exposed group, while 370,233 participants without such conditions were in the unexposed group. Measurements We obtained information on positive results of COVID-19 test as registered in the Public Health England, COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the UK Biobank inpatient hospital data, and COIVD-19 related deaths from the death registers. We also identified individuals who was hospitalized for infections other than COVID-19 during the follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for multiple confounders. Results The mean age at outbreak was 67.8 years and around 43% of the study participants were male. We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorder, compared with those without such diagnoses. The fully adjusted ORs were 1.44 (95%CI 1.27 to 1.64), 1.67 (1.42 to 1.98), and 2.03 (1.56 to 2.63) for any COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, COVID-19 related death, respectively. The excess risk was observed across all levels of somatic comorbidities and subtypes of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, while further increased with greater number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and increased risk of hospitalization for other infections (1.85 [1.65 to 2.07]). Conclusions Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of COVID-19, especially severe and fatal COVID-19. The similar association observed for hospitalization for other infections suggests a shared pathway between psychiatric disorders and different infections, including altered immune responses.","Yang, H.; Chen, W.; Hu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Zeng, Y.; Sun, Y.; Ying, Z.; He, J.; Qu, Y.; Lu, D.; Fang, F.; Valdimarsdottir, U.

44,The effect of school closures and reopening strategies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in the San Francisco Bay Area: a cross-sectional survey and modeling analysis,"Background Large-scale school closures have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear. Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys. We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies. Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children <10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases; 95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813; 95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030; 95% CI: 3,118, 11,676). School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures. Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40.7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1.9, 61.1), middle school teachers (37.2%, 95% CI: 4.6, 58.1), and elementary school teachers (4.1%, 95% CI: -1.7, 12.0). Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening. The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level. A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools. Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening. Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures.","Head, J.

45,HIV infection and COVID-19 death: population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care data and linked national death registrations within the OpenSAFELY platform,"Background: It is unclear whether HIV infection is associated with risk of COVID-19 death. We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.","Bhaskaran, K.; Rentsch, C.

46,"Characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units for COVID-19 during the first 60 days of the 2020 pandemic: a registry-based, multicenter, observational study.","Background The mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear due to variable censoring and substantial proportions of undischarged patients at follow-up. Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission. Methods We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome. Results A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66.8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 (75.0-140.6) mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5 [1.1-2.1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1.3 [1.2-1.4]), severe ARDS (aOR 3.1 [2.0-4.8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1.4 [1.0-1.9]), and CRRT (aOR 2.2 [1.6-3.0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. Conclusions Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting comorbidities.","Chew, M.

47,Obtaining prevalence estimates of COVID-19: A model to inform decision-making,"Objectives: The primary aim was to evaluate whether randomly sampling and testing a set number of individuals for active or past COVID-19 while adjusting for misclassification error captures a simulated prevalence. The secondary aim was to quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Methods: Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Data from the 2014-2018 and 2018 American Community Surveys were used. The simulated prevalence was 0.5% and 1.0% for active and past COVID-19, respectively. Bayesian models, informed by published validity estimates, were used to account for misclassification error when estimating the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Results: Failure to account for misclassification error overestimated the simulated prevalence for active and past COVID-19. Adjustment for misclassification error decreased the point estimate for active and past COVID-10 prevalence by 55% and 29%, respectively. Adjustment for sampling method and misclassification error only captured the simulated past COVID-19 prevalence. The simulated active COVID-19 prevalence was only captured when set to 0.7% and above. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data increased the estimated average daily cases by 8%. Conclusions: Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 is needed but must be accompanied by adjustment for misclassification error to avoid over- or underestimating the prevalence. This approach bolsters disease control efforts. Implementing random testing for active COVID-19 may be best in a smaller geographic area with highly prevalent cases.","Sahlu, I.; Whittaker, A.

48,SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality risk in a nationwide seroepidemiological study,"The magnitude of the infection fatality risk (IFR) of SARS-CoV-2 remains under debate. Because the IFR is the number of deaths divided by the number of infected, serological studies are needed to identify asymptomatic and mild cases. Also, because ascertainment of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is often incomplete, the calculation of the IFR needs to be complemented with data on excess mortality. We used data from a nation-wide seroepidemiological study and two sources of mortality information -deaths among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and excess deaths- to estimate the range of IFR, both overall and by age and sex, in Spain. The overall IFR ranged between 1.1% and 1.4% in men and 0.58% to 0.77% in women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% and 16.4% in men [&ge;]80 years and between 4.6% and 6.5% in women [&ge;]80 years.

49,BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY IN SINGAPORE,"Introduction: As part of infection control measures for COVID-19, individuals have been encouraged to adopt both preventive (e.g., handwashing) and avoidant behavioural changes (e.g., avoiding crowds). In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","Long, V. J.; Liu, J.

50,"Dynamic Analysis of Social Distancing Ratio, Isolation Rate and Transmission Coefficient in COVID-19 Epidemic for Many Countries by SIQR Model","Recently SIQR model was proposed by Odagaki as the modification of conventional SIR model by adding the term for isolation of infected persons, Q(Quarantined). The exponent {lambda} of the exponential function expressing the number of newly tested positive persons was defined as an linear equation explicitly with three important parameters, transmission coefficient, social distancing ratio x and isolation rate q. In this study, applying this model to the number of positive persons in publicly available database, daily {lambda} values are regression analyzed, and social distancing ratio and isolation rate are derived. Analyses for 7 countries including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and western countries are performed and determine the dynamic locus of q-x relation on the q-x plane during epidemic propagation. Finally, the remaining parameter, the transmission coefficient is shown to closely relate to the maximum {lambda}, {lambda}max, and {lambda}max (transmission coefficient) is characterized as a specific value for each country. Then, the magnitude of {lambda}max is combined with the value of {lambda}min to influence the total number of new cases until the convergence stage.","Hashiguchi, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20167882v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20167882v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
51,Public perceptions and preventive behaviours during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom,"Background: In the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of the pandemic. Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures. Results: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as 'high' were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as 'easy' were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by region. Discussion: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","Bowman, L.; Kwok, K.

52,Children's Anxiety and Physical Activity during COVID-19 in Relation to Prenatal Exposure to Gestational Diabetes,"Research goal: Assess the relationships between anxiety levels, physical activity and in utero exposure to Gestational Diabetes mellitus (GDM) in children age 9 to 15, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants completed phone call or video calls with study personnel where they were asked to report on their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hour physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. GDM-exposure was assessed using electronic medical records. Results: Children who reported higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity or vigorous physical activity, reported lower anxiety symptoms. Children exposed to GDM in utero reported higher anxiety scores and lower engagement in vigorous physical activity compared to unexposed children. Moreover, the pathway through which children exposed to GDM in utero, reported higher anxiety was partially explained by reduced engagement in vigorous physical activity (75%, p=0.05). Conclusions: Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly among children exposed to GDM in utero, who are at increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes.","Alves, J.; Yunker, A.

53,Outcome of Conservative Therapy in COVID-19 Patients Presenting with Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"Background: There is a paucity of data on the management of gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding in patients with COVID-19 amid concerns about the risk of transmission during endoscopic procedures.We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, 24 of 1342(1.8%) patients with COVID-19, presenting with GI bleeding from 22ndApril to 22ndJuly 2020, were included. Results: The mean age of patients was 45.8+/-12.7 years; 17(70.8%) were males; upper GI(UGI) bleeding: lower GI(LGI) 23:1. Twenty-two(91.6%) patients had evidence of cirrhosis- 21 presented with UGI bleeding while one had bleeding from hemorrhoids. Two patients without cirrhosis were presumed to have non-variceal bleeding. The medical therapy for UGI bleeding included vasoconstrictors- somatostatin in 17(73.9%) and terlipressin in 4(17.4%) patients. All patients with UGI bleeding received proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. Packed red blood cells(PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma and platelets were transfused in 14(60.9%), 3(13.0%) and 3(13.0%), respectively. The median PRBCs transfused was 1(0-3) unit(s). The initial control of UGI bleeding was achieved in all 23 patients and none required an emergency endoscopy. At 5-day follow-up, none rebled or died. Two patients later rebled, one had intermittent bleed due to gastric antral vascular ectasia, while another had rebleed 19 days after discharge. Three(12.5%) cirrhosis patients succumbed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during hospital stay. Conclusion: Conservative management strategies including pharmacotherapy, restrictive transfusion strategy, and close hemodynamic monitoring can successfully manage GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and reduce need for urgent endoscopy.","Shalimar, D.; Vaishnav, M.; Elhence, A.; Kumar, R.; Mohta, S.; Palle, C.; Kumar, P.; Ranjan, M.; Vajpai, T.; Prasad, S.; Yegurla, J.; Dhooria, A.; Banyal, V.; Agarwal, S.; Bansal, R.; Bhattacharjee, S.; Aggarwal, R.; Soni, K.

54,Specificity and Performance of Nucleocapsid and Spike-based SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays,"There is an urgent need for an accurate antibody test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this paper, we have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance in comparison with four commercial ELISAs, EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were compared using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of positive signals from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, positivity varied with assay repetition. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with analyte prior to performing the assay). In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by analyte spiking. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of false positivity in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the analyte, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance.","Rikhtegaran Tehrani, Z.; Saadat, S.; Saleh, E.; Ouyang, X.; Constantine, N.; DeVico, A. L.; Harris, A.

55,A SEIR-like model with a time-dependent contagion factor describes the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic,"I consider a simple, deterministic SEIR-like model without spatial or age structure, including a presymptomatic state and distinguishing between reported and nonreported infected individuals. Using a time-dependent contagion factor {beta}(t) (in the form a piecewise constant function) and literature values for other epidemiological parameters, I obtain good fits to observational data for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in over 160 regions (103 countries, 24 Brazilian states and 34 U.S. counties). The evolution of {beta} is useful for characterizing the state of the epidemic. The analysis provides insight into general trends associated with the pandemic, such as the tendency toward reduced contagion, and the fraction of the population exposed to the virus.","Dickman, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169557v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169557v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
56,"SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in decedents in a large, urban medical examiner's office","Background: SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic. Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 821 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (237) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (584). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. Results: Decedents were more likely to be male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) than the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (89% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions: Disease surveillance through medical examiners and coroners could supplement other forms of surveillance and may serve as a possible early outbreak warning sign.","Brouwer, A.

59,The SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest: the relevance of the airborne transmission,"Background This paper presents a global analysis of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus. Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works. Methods To investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets. Findings The transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region. Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus. Interpretation An onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet. The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence. There is no safe indoor distance for the coronavirus transmission. So, mask and eye protection are essential.","Crema, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169433v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20169433v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
60,Strategic anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology testing in a low prevalence pandemic: The COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study in health care professionals,"Background: Serology testing is explored for epidemiological research and to inform individuals after suspected infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. Methods: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralization test, and a neutralization assay using live SARS-CoV-2. Results: From baseline to week six, n=1,080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from n=217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4 % in week six, p<0.001). In sera of convalescent PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from ELISAs using e.g. the S1 spike protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralization. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the six week study period. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralization against live SARS CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. Conclusion: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays. Our data highlight the need for a methodical serology screening approach in regions with low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.","Behrens, G. M.; Cossmann, A.; Stankov, M.

61,Neutralizing antibody response in non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients,"The majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) are asymptomatic or mild without the necessity of hospitalization. It is of outmost importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SCoV2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We hence conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against authentic SCoV2 employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SCoV2 and two other sera (4%) were only positive in one of the serological assays employed. For the remainder, antibody response against the S-protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. Only six sera (12%) could be classified as highly neutralizing. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, our data suggest that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E contribute to SCoV2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SCoV2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SCoV2.","Ruetalo, N.; Businger, R.; Althaus, K.; Fink, S.; Ruoff, F.; Hamprecht, K.; Flehmig, B.; Bakchould, T.; Templin, M.

62,Associations between personal protective equipment and nursing staff stress during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The results of several projects on the effects of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been published since the outbreak of COVID-19. It is known that wearing PPE, and specifically face masks, has physcial consequences like headache and pain, which can increase stress among nursing staff. However, none of these studies placed a focus on PPE and nursing staff, although nurses are the only members of the health care profession who are at the patients bedsides 24/7, and PPE is the only way to protect them from a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between the use of PPE and stress among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted, which we distributed using snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of (inter-)national recommendations as well as the international literature. We used the perceived level of stress scale to measure the nursing staff members stress levels. Results We included data collected from 2600 nurses in this analysis. Nearly all nursing staff wore face masks. We showed that more than two-thirds of the nurses had moderate to high levels of stress. No statistically significant association between the use of PPE and stress was detected. However, we show a statistically significant association between the duration of mask usage and stress. Discussion and conclusions Nearly all participating nurses wore face masks or FFP masks to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This observation might indicate that Austrian nurses display a high level of compliance with national and international regulations and play a key role in such pandemics. Our results also show that increased mask-wearing time led to increased stress levels. These results suggest that (inter-)national regulations on how and when to use PPE should include a maximum duration of time for wearing each type of mask. Such regulations could help to prevent work-related stress, particularly in the case of future epidemics, and avoid burnout among nursing staff or even nurses leaving their jobs. The consequences of both of these negative outcomes should be considered in light of the predicted expected future shortage of health care workers.","Hoedl, M.; Eglseer, D.; Bauer, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20164129v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20164129v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
63,Association of mental disorders with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe health outcomes: a nationwide cohort study,"Background: No epidemiological data exists for the association between mental disorders and the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Aims: To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. Methods: We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on the national health insurance data. Each patient with a mental or behavioral disorder (diagnosed during six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index with up to four patients without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk and risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 230,565 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33,653 (14.6%) had mental disorders, 928/33,653 (2.76%) tested positive, and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariate analysis with the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2 positivity risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.12); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81). Among confirmed cases, mortality risk significantly increased in patients with mental disorders (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.07-3.15). Conclusion: Mental disorders are likely contributing factors of mortality following COVID-19. Although the infection risk did not increase in overall mental disorders, patients with schizophrenia-related disorders were more vulnerable to the infection.","Jeon, H.-L.; Kwon, J.

64,CRISPR-based and RT-qPCR surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals uncovers a shift in viral prevalence among a university population,"Background: The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacts the health of communities around the world, with unique impacts on colleges and universities. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic people is thought to be the underlying cause of a large proportion of new infections. However, the local prevalence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by local public health restrictions and the community setting. Objectives: This study has three main objectives. First, we looked to establish the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection on a university campus in California. Second, we sought to assess the changes in viral prevalence associated with the shifting community conditions related to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Third, we aimed to compare the performance of CRISPR- and PCR-based assays for large-scale virus surveillance sampling in COVID-19 asymptomatic persons. Methods: We enrolled 1,808 asymptomatic persons for self-collection of oropharyngeal (OP) samples to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing. We compared viral prevalence in samples obtained in two time periods: May 28th-June 11th; June 23rd-July 2nd. We detected viral genomes in these samples using two assays: CREST, a CRISPR-based method recently developed at UCSB, and the RT-qPCR test recommended by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 1,808 participants, 1,805 were affiliates of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 1,306 were students. None of the tests performed on the 732 samples collected between late May to early June were positive. In contrast, tests performed on the 1076 samples collected between late June to early July, revealed nine positive cases. This change in prevalence met statistical significance, p = 0.013. One sample was positive by RT-qPCR at the threshold of detection, but negative by both CREST and CLIA-confirmation testing. With this single exception, there was perfect concordance in both positive and negative results obtained by RT-qPCR and CREST. The estimated prevalence of the virus, calculated using the confirmed cases, was 0.74%. The average age of our sample population was 28.33 (18-75) years, and the average age of the positive cases was 21.7 years (19-30). Conclusions: Our study revealed that there were no COVID-19 cases in our study population in May/June. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in community restrictions and public interactions. This increase in prevalence, in a young and asymptomatic population which would not have otherwise accessed COVID-19 testing, indicated the leading wave of a local outbreak, and coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. Our results substantiate that large, population-level asymptomatic screening using self-collection may be a feasible and instructive aspect of the public health approach within large campus communities, and the almost perfect concordance between CRISPR- and PCR-based assays indicate expanded options for surveillance testing","Rauch, J.

65,Quickly And Simply Detection For Coronavirus Including SARS-CoV-2 On The Mobile Real-Time PCR Device And Without RNA Extraction,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported to WHO as an outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on end of 2019, afterwards epidemic in many countries, and pandemic on the worldwide in 2020. Usually detection of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR method, but it must be long time that RNA is treated by extraction, concentration and purification, and detected by RT-PCR method. We modified various methods, of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough. In one point of the evaluations, real-time RT-PCR could be finished in very short time with using mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100 (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.). It was able to detect positive control RNA for 20 minutes by each method according to the National Institute of Infections Disease in Japan (NIID), and less than 13.5 minutes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in USA (CDC). In another point of the evaluations, surprisingly, Human coronavirus 229E, which was substituted for SARS-CoV-2, could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of RNA. As that was, it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct RT-PCR. Therefore, it might eliminate wasteful time, avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination. In light of the above two points, SARS-CoV-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply. With using this mobile real-time PCR, these methods should be suitable for not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods.","Muraoka, M.; Tanoi, Y.; Tada, T.; Mizukoshi, M.; Kawaguchi, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20168294v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20168294v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True

We evaluated the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in prepandemic sample cohorts across five sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Methods: Specificity of the immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual serum and/or plasma samples from blood donors or routine diagnostic testing. All samples were collected before September 2019 and therefore presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cohorts included samples from blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric patients. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Overall specificities for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 9575 samples from blood donors (n = 6714) and diagnostic specimens (n = 2861) were 99.82% (95% CI 99.69-99.91) and 99.93% (95% CI 99.75-99.99), respectively. Among 2256 samples from pregnant women, specificity was 99.91% (95% CI 99.68-99.99). Among 205 paediatric samples, specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.22-100). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a very high specificity across blood donor samples and diagnostic specimens from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

67,"Wrong person, place and time: viral load and contact network structure predict SARS-CoV-2 transmission and super-spreading events","SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because most transmissions occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection. Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than two days congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.","Goyal, A.; Reeves, D.

68,Performance assessment of 11 commercial serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 on hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) towards severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the onset of COVID-19 outbreak. Their thorough validation is of extreme importance before using them as epidemiological tools to infer population seroprevalence, and as complementary diagnostic tools to molecular approaches (e.g. RT-qPCR). Here we assayed commercial serological tests (semiquantitative and qualitative) from 11 suppliers in 126 samples collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and from 36 healthy and HIV-infected individuals (collected at the pre-COVID-19 pandemic). Specificity was above 95% in 9 tests. Samples from COVID-19 patients were stratified by days since symptoms onset (<10, 10-15, 16-21 and >21 days). Tests sensitivity increases with time since symptoms onset, and peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum: 91.2%); and from 16-21 to >21 days for IgG, depending on the test (maximum: 94.1%). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with severe clinical presentation have lower relative levels of IgM, IgA and IgG at <10 days since symptoms onset in comparison to patients with non-severe presentation. At >21 days since symptoms onset the relative levels of IgM and IgG (in one test) are significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation, suggesting a delay in the upsurge of Ig against SARS-CoV-2 in those patients. This study highlights the high specificity of most of the evaluated tests, and sensitivity heterogeneity. Considering the virus genetic evolution and population immune response to it, continuous monitoring of commercially available serological tests towards SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.","Serre-Miranda, C.; Nobrega, C.; Roque, S.; Canto-Gomes, J.; Silva, C.

The odds ratio is 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.57; P = 1.3 x 10-4) per additional 10 years of life, and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.77; P = 7.2 x 10-6) per unit higher log odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. On the other hand, there was no association between COVID-19 susceptibility and healthspan (the lifespan free of the top seven age-related morbidities). To examine the relationship at the phenotypic level, we applied various biological aging clock models and detected an association between the biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection for all subjects as well as for the individuals free of chronic disease. Biological age acceleration was also significantly associated with the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest a causal relationship between aging and COVID-19, defined by genetic variance, the rate of aging, and the burden of chronic diseases.","Ying, K.; Zhai, R.; Pyrkov, T.

71,Predicted Cellular Immunity Population Coverage Gaps for SARS-CoV-2 Subunit Vaccines and their Augmentation by Compact Joint Sets,"Subunit vaccines induce immunity to a pathogen by presenting a component of the pathogen and thus inherently limit the representation of pathogen peptides for cellular immunity based memory. We find that SARS-CoV-2 subunit peptides may not be robustly displayed by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules in certain individuals. We introduce an augmentation strategy for subunit vaccines that adds a small number of peptides to a vaccine to improve the population coverage of pathogen peptide display. We augment a subunit vaccine by selecting additional pathogen peptides to maximize the total number of vaccine peptide hits against the distribution of MHC haplotypes in a population. For each subunit we design independent MHC class I and MHC class II peptide sets for augmentation, and alternatively design a combined set of peptides for MHC class I and class II display. We evaluate the population coverage of 9 different subunits of SARS-CoV-2, including 5 functional domains and 4 full proteins, and augment each of them to fill a predicted coverage gap. We predict that a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain subunit vaccine will have fewer than six peptide-HLA hits with [&le;] 50 nM binding affinity per individual in 51.31% (class I) and 32.99% (class II) of the population, and with augmentation, the uncovered population is predicted to be reduced to 0.54% (class I) and 1.46% (class II). We find that a joint set of pathogen peptides for MHC class I and class II display is predicted to produce a more compact vaccine design than using independent sets for MHC class I and class II. We provide an open source implementation of our design methods (OptiVax), vaccine evaluation tool (EvalVax), as well as the data used in our design efforts here: https://github.com/gifford-lab/optivax/tree/master/augmentation.","Liu, G.; Carter, B.; Gifford, D.

72,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult,"Numerous studies covering some aspects of SARS-CoV-2 data analyses are being published on a daily basis, including a regularly updated phylogeny on nextstrain.org. Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising all virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be possible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes based on statistical criteria is also not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","Morel, B.; Barbera, P.; Czech, L.; Bettisworth, B.; Huebner, L.; Lutteropp, S.; Serdari, D.; Kostaki, E.-G.; Mamais, I.; Kozlov, A.; Pavlidis, P.

73,IFN signaling and neutrophil degranulation transcriptional signatures are induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity. Together, our transcriptomic studies have delineated disease pathways to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to facilitate the design of new therapeutics for COVID-19.","Rosa, B.

74,Signatures and mechanisms of efficacious therapeutic ribonucleotides against SARS-CoV-2 revealed by analysis of its replicase using magnetic tweezers,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from an infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the third coronavirus outbreak to plague humanity this century. Currently, the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the Remdesivir (RDV), an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here, we have applied a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV, a Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106), and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state, the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC, T-1106 accesses LFC as a non-cognate nucleotide, while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous reports, we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase, only appearing as termination events when traditional, gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection, inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Use of this experimental paradigm will be essential to the development of therapeutic nucleotide analogs targeting polymerases.","Seifert, M.; Bera, S. C.; van Nies, P.; Kirchdoerfer, R.

75,Structure of papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2 and its complexes with non-covalent inhibitors,"The number of new cases world-wide for the COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, while efforts to contain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is producing varied results in different countries. There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60-2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro, with the ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value for SARS-CoV-2.","Osipiuk, J.; Azizi, S.-A.; Dvorkin, S.; Endres, M.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Jones, K.

76,Computational Hot-Spot Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain / ACE2 Complex,"Infection and replication of SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) requires entry to the interior of host cells. In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted  hot-spot residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and the CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI and SARS CoV-2 / ACE2 PPI. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.","Rosario, P.

78,Peptide Antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),"The design of an immunogenic scaffold that serves a role in treating a pathogen, and can be rapidly and predictively modeled, has remained an elusive feat. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK is designed to ""uncloak"" the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.","Watson, A.; Ferreira, L.

79,Evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and its consequences,"The emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has created a global confusing pandemic health crisis that warrants an accurate and detailed characterization of the rapidly evolving viral genome for understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis and containment. We explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency mutations ([&ge;] 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M. S.; Islam, M. R.; Ul Alam, A. S.

T cell responses to viruses can be corrected by adoptive cellular therapy using donor-derived virus-specific T cells. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2-exposed blood donations contain CD4 and CD8 memory T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens. These peptides can be used to isolate virus-specific T cells in a GMP-compliant process. These T cells can be rapidly expanded using GMP-compliant reagents for use as a therapeutic product. Memory and effector phenotypes are present in the selected virus-specific T cells, but our method rapidly expands the desirable central memory phenotype. A manufacturing yield ranging from 1010 to 1011 T cells can be obtained within 21 days culture. Thus, multiple therapeutic doses of virus-specific T cells can be rapidly generated from convalescent donors for treatment of COVID-19 patients

In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data obtained from different human respiratory cell lines and patient samples (Swab, PBMC, lung biopsy, BALF) to understand the metabolic alterations in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, the expression pattern of metabolic genes in the human genome-scale metabolic network model Recon3D was explored. We identified metabolic genes and pathways and reporter metabolites under each SARS-CoV-2-infected condition and compared them to identify common and unique changes in the metabolism. Our analysis revealed host-dependent dysregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism. We observed different metabolic changes that are pro- and antiviral in nature. We generated hypotheses on how antiviral metabolism can be targeted/enhanced for reducing viral titers.

83,Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2-related proteases and its metabolite GBPA exerts antiviral activity,"Antiviral therapy is urgently needed to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover, the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg/day) will result in antiviral activity.","Hoffmann, M.; Hofmann-Winkler, H.; Smith, J.

Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B.

Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.

86,The DHODH Inhibitor PTC299 Arrests SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Suppresses Induction of Inflammatory Cytokines,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created an urgent need for therapeutics that inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus and suppress the fulminant inflammation characteristic of advanced illness. Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.","Luban, J.; Sattler, R.; Muhlberger, E.; Graci, J.

88,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant genomes,"Viral recombination has the potential to bring about viral genotypes with modified phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among Betacoronaviruses is well documented, SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in humans for approximately 8 months and thus has had a relatively short window of opportunity for the occurrence of recombination. The ability to detect recombination has further been limited by the relatively low levels of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, two studies have reported recombinants among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we first revisit these findings with a new analysis approach, arguing that neither presents a clear case of within-SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Applying this same approach to available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we then identify five recombinant genomes. Each of these genomes contain phylogenetic markers of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 clades. Further, the predicted parent clades of these recombinant genomes were, with one exception, documented to be co-circulating in the country of infection in the two weeks prior to the sample being collected. Our results indicate that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 strains is occurring, but is either not widespread or often remains undetectable given current levels of viral genetic diversity. Efforts to monitor the emergence of new recombinant genomes should therefore be sustained.","VanInsberghe, D.; Neish, A. S.; Lowen, A.

89,Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India on molecular diagnostic assays,"An isolated epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) originating in Wuhan, China has now rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.","Jain, A.; Rophina, M.; Mahajan, S.; Krishnan, B.

90,Pathogenetic Perspective of Missense Mutations of ORF3a Protein of SARS-CoV2,"One of the most important proteins for COVID-19 pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 is the ORF3a protein which is the largest accessory protein among others accessory proteins coded by coronavirus genome. The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","Hassan, S.

92,A valid protective immune response elicited in rhesus macaques by an inactivated vaccine is capable of defending against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"With the relatively serious global epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, public concerns focus on not only clinical therapeutic measures and public quarantine for this disease but also the development of vaccines. The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should include not only specific neutralizing antibodies but also specific CTL responses against at least the S and N antigens.","Chen, H.; Xie, Z.; Long, R.; Fan, S.; Li, H.; He, Z.; Xu, K.; Liao, Y.; Wang, L.; Zhang, Y.; Li, X.; Dong, X.; Mou, T.; Zhou, X.; Yang, Y.; Guo, L.; Yang, J.; Zheng, H.; Xu, X.; Li, J.; Liang, Y.; Li, D.; Zhao, Z.; Hong, C.; Zhao, H.; Jiang, G.; Che, Y.; Yang, F.; Hu, Y.; Wang, X.; Pu, J.; Ma, K.; Wang, L.; Chen, C.; Duan, W.; Shen, D.; Zhao, H.; Jiang, R.; Deng, X.; Li, Y.; Zhu, H.; Zhou, J.; Yu, L.; Xu, M.; Yang, H.; Yi, L.; Zhou, Z.; Yang, J.; Duan, N.; Yang, H.; Zhao, W.; Yang, W.; Li, C.; Liu, L.; Li, Q.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235747v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235747v1?rss=1,2020-08-04,2020-08-04,,False
93,"SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis of strains in Pakistan reveals GH, S and L clade strains at the start of the pandemic","ObjectivesPakistan has a high infectious disease burden with about 265,000 reported cases of COVID-19. We investigated the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains and present the first data on viruses circulating in the country.

MethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing and data analysis of SARS-CoV-2 eleven strains isolated in March and May.

ResultsStrains from travelers clustered with those from China, Saudi Arabia, India, USA and Australia. Five of eight SARS-CoV-2 strains were GH clade with Spike glycoprotein D614G, Ns3 gene Q57H, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P4715L mutations. Two were S (ORF8 L84S and N S202N) and three were L clade and one was an I clade strain. One GH and one L strain each displayed Orf1ab L3606F indicating further evolutionary transitions.

ConclusionsThis data reveals SARS-CoV-2 strains of L, G, S and I have been circulating in Pakistan from March, at the start of the pandemic. It indicates viral diversity regarding infection in this populous region. Continuing molecular genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of disease severity will be important to understand virus transmission patterns and host related determinants of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","Ghanchi, N.

94,A distinct innate immune signature marks progression from mild to severe COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with a range of severities, but immune signatures of mild and severe disease are still not fully understood. Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN{gamma}+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.","Chevrier, S.; Zurbuchen, Y.; Cervia, C.; Adamo, S.; Raeber, M.

95,Analytical validity of nanopore sequencing for rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis,"Viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides critical insight into the transmission and evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, we performed viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. Despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >98% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives.","Bull, R.

96,Hypertonic saline solution inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assay,"We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At this date more than 680 thousand people have died due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Unfortunately, until now no effective treatment to combat the virus and vaccine are available. We performed experiments to test if hypertonic saline solution is able to inhibit virus replication in vitro. Our data shows that 260 mM NaCl (1.5%) inhibits 100% SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the virus replication inhibition is due to an intracellular mechanism and not due to the dissociation between spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. NaCl depolarizes the plasma membrane supposedly associated with the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

A safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. Many human viral vaccines are live attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the development of a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03-CA22{degrees}C/2020) by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37{degrees}C to 22{degrees}C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans through nasal spray. Its single dose was observed to strongly induce the neutralising antibody (>640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibody in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show loss of body weight, death, and the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys.

99,Similarity between mutation spectra in hypermutated genomes of rubella virus and in SARS-CoV-2 genomes accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Genomes of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV2 isolates have been sequenced across the world and the total number of changes (predominantly single base substitutions) in these isolates exceeds ten thousand. We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella - another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2 - likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","Gordenin, D.
