0,Investigation into Quality of Life and Psychological Status of Different Populations during COVID-19 : A study concerning Surrounding Areas of Wuhan,"Objective To investigate different populations' quality of life and psychological status in surrounding areas of Wuhan during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The data of 248 residents living in Anhui from February 4 to 6 of 2020 were collected through network survey including age, gender, occupation, the World Health Organization Quality of Life measurement Scale short form (World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument - brief, WHOQOL BREF), Zung Self rating Anxiety Scale (Self- rating Anxiety Scale, SAS and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Those surveyed, divided into two groups: medical staff (129 cases) and non-medical staff (119 cases), were made statistic analysis according to the factors mentioned above. Results The WHOQOL-BREF of medical staff in this region was lower than that of non-medical staff in the fields of physiology, psychology, social relations and environment, among whom female medical staff scored significantly lower than that of male medical staff in four fields. There was no significant statistical difference in SAS and SDS scores between the two groups, and gender had no significant influence on SAS and SDS scores of medical staff. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical staff enjoyed a lower quality of life of in surrounding areas of Wuhan than that of non-medical staff, and female medical staff even lower, which should arouse social concern.","Liu, Z.; Mu, J.; Fan, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20158725v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20158725v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
1,End-to-End Protocol for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Built Environments,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory virus primarily transmitted from person to person through inhalation of droplets or aerosols, laden with viral particles. However, as some studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up to 72 hours on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through contact. For this reason, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces include using an Isohelix swab as a collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, SARS-CoV-2 viral standards were still recovered from surfaces as detected by RT-qPCR for as long as eight days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to negatively impact the recovery of RNA, with Amerstat inhibition as high as 90% when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test surfaces. When this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of virus or below the detection limit of the assay.","Parker, C.

2,Quantifying the efficiency of non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe,"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, governments around the World have implemented a combination of public health responses based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), with significant social and economic consequences. Though most European countries have overcome the first epidemic wave, it remains of high priority to quantify the efficiency of different NPIs to inform preparedness for an impending second wave. In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","Garchitorena, A.; Gruson, H.; Cazelles, B.; ROCHE, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20174821v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
3,SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children with MIS-C and mild and severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) possess higher SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers compared to those with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), likely reflecting a longer time since onset of infection in MIS-C patients.","Anderson, E.

4,Data-Driven Development of a Small-Area COVID-19 Vulnerability Index for the United States,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in the United States, it has become clear that infection risk is higher in certain populations, particularly socially and economically marginalized groups. Social risk factors, together with other demographic and community characteristics, may reveal local variations and inequities in COVID risk that could be useful for targeting testing and interventions. Yet to date, rates of infection and estimations of COVID risk are typically reported at the county and state level. In this study we develop a small area vulnerability index based on publicly-available sociodemographic data and 668,428 COVID diagnoses reported in 4,803 ZIP codes in the United States (15% of all ZIP codes). The outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis rates per 100,000 people by ZIP code. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic characteristics obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Bayesian multivariable techniques were used to capture complexities of spatial data and spatial autocorrelation and identify individual risk factors and derive their respective weights in the index. COVID-19 diagnosis rates varied from zero to 29,508 per 100,000 people. The final vulnerability index showed that higher population density, higher percentage of noninsured, nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with COVID-19 diagnosis rates. Our findings indicate disproportionate risk of COVID-19 infection among some populations and validate and expand understanding of these inequities, integrating several risk factors into a summary index reflecting composite vulnerability to infection. This index can provide local public health and other agencies with evidence-based metrics of COVID risk at a geographical scale that has not been previously available to most US communities.","amram, o.; Amiri, S.; Thorn, E.

5,Healthcare workers high COVID-19 infection rate: the source of infections and potential for respirators and surgical masks to reduce occupational infections,"Objective: To analyse the work-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and trace the source of COVID-19 infections in tertiary hospitals healthcare workers in light of the used PPE and their ability to maintain social distances and follow governmental restrictions. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Tertiary hospitals in Uusimaa region, Finland Participants: Of 1072 enrolled, 866 HCWs (588 nurses, 170 doctors and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) from the Helsinki University Hospital completed the questionnaire by July 15th, 2020. The average age of participants was 42.4 years and 772 (89.0%) were women. The participants answered a detailed questionnaire of their PPE usage, ability to follow safety restrictions, exposure to COVID-19, the source of potential COVID-19 infection and both mental and physical symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 in Finland. Main outcome measures: All participants with COVID-19 symptoms were tested with either RT-PCR or antibody tests. The infections were traced and categorised based on the location and source of infection. The possibility to maintain social distance and PPE usage during exposure were analyzed. Results: Of the HCWs that participated, 41 (4.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, marking a substantially higher infection rate than that of the general population (0.3%); 22 (53.6%) of infections were confirmed or likely occupational, including 7 (31.8%) from colleagues. Additionally, 5 (26.3%) of other infections were from colleagues outside the working facilities. 14 (63.6%) of occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and aerosol precautions while treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: While treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, HCWs should wear an FFP2/3 respirator and recommended PPE. Maintaining safety distances in the workplace and controlling infections between HCWs should be priorities to ensure safe working conditions.","Oksanen, L.-M. A.

6,Acute Peritoneal Dialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Bellevue Hospital in New York City,"The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented strain on hospitals in New York City. Although practitioners focused on the pulmonary devastation, resources for the provision of dialysis proved to be more constrained. To deal with these shortfalls, NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue, NYU Brooklyn, NYU Medical Center and the New York Harbor VA Healthcare System, put together a plan to offset the anticipated increased needs for kidney replacement therapy. Prior to the pandemic, peritoneal dialysis was not used for acute kidney injury at Bellevue Hospital. We were able to rapidly establish an acute peritoneal dialysis program at Bellevue Hospital for acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit. A dedicated surgery team was assembled to work with the nephrologists for bedside placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheters. A multi-disciplinary team was trained by the lead nephrologist to deliver peritoneal dialysis in the intensive care unit. Between April 8, 2020 and May 8, 2020, 39 peritoneal dialysis catheters were placed at Bellevue Hospital. 38 patients were successfully started on peritoneal dialysis. As of June 10, 2020, 16 patients recovered renal function. One end stage kidney disease patient was converted to peritoneal dialysis and was discharged. One catheter was poorly functioning, and the patient was changed to hemodialysis before recovering renal function. There were no episodes of peritonitis and nine incidents of minor leaking, which resolved. Some patients received successful peritoneal dialysis while being ventilated in the prone position. In summary, despite severe shortages of staff, supplies and dialysis machines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to rapidly implement a de novo peritoneal dialysis program which enabled provision of adequate kidney replacement therapy to all admitted patients who needed it. Our experience is a model for the use of acute peritoneal dialysis in crisis situations.","Caplin, N.

7,Risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes of COVID-19 patients on the 14th and 28th day of the disease course: a retrospective cohort study in Bangladesh,"Diverse risk factors intercede the outcomes of COVID-19. We conducted this retrospective cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4% Vs. 6.0%) and mortality (2.3% Vs. 2.5%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17) on the 28th day. Mortality risk factors included elderly (AOR=10.14), COPD (RR=5.93), and SLT (AOR=2.25) on the 14th day, and elderly (AOR=24.37) and COPD (RR=2.72) on the 28th day. The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day. The mortality risk was higher with coronary heart disease (RR=4.54) and CLD (RR=9.66) on the 14th while with diabetes mellitus (RR=3.08, RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=3.14, RR=2.30), CKD (RR=8.97, RR=2.71), and malignant diseases (RR=10.29) on both 14th and 28th day.

8,"Evidence and magnitude of seasonality in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: Penny wise, pandemic foolish?","Abstract: Importance: Intensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal changes. Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","Kaplin, A.

10,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to COVID-19: A systematic review,"Importance. In April 2020, multiple reports of an association between a hyperinflammatory, Kawasaki-like condition and SARS-CoV-2 were published and termed as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). A thorough characterization of this syndrome (demographics, presentation, diagnosis, and outcome) is currently lacking. Objective. We aimed to perform a systematic review of published cases of this novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19. Evidence review. A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and COVID-19 specific research repositories (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database) was conducted from December 30th, 2019 to June 30th, 2020. Publications describing inflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 were included. Of 333 unique publications, 229 records were excluded based on title and abstract. After screening the full text, 40 observational studies and case reports were included, comprising 687 cases (published between May 9th, 2020 and June 30th, 2020). Findings. In contrast to classic Kawasaki disease, epidemiological enrichment for adolescents (median age 9 [6.0-12.3]) and ethnic minorities (35.8% black and 24.5% Hispanic/Latino) was observed. There was a male predominance (59.1%). Apart from obesity (24.4%), pre-existing conditions were infrequent. The majority suffered from gastrointestinal (87.2%) and cardiocirculatory (79.2%) manifestations. Respiratory symptoms (51.2%) were less frequent. Over half of patients (56.3%) presented with hemodynamic shock, and critical care interventions were often necessary (inotropics (56.5%), mechanical ventilation (22.9%), non-invasive ventilation (30.6%), extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO;4.5%)). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and RT-PCR were positive in respectively 69.4% and 36.7%. Eleven deaths were reported (1.6%). The RCPCH case definition proved to be most comprehensive comprising all single cases. In contrast, WHO and CDC MIS definitions are more stringent, with the CDC case definition often missing severe cases requiring intensive care (n = 33 out of 95 cases). Conclusions and Relevance. This novel pediatric multisystem hyperinflammatory condition, associated with COVID-19, is characterized by a severe and heterogeneous disease spectrum. Despite frequent intensive care interventions, mortality rate was low and short-term outcome favorable. Long-term follow-up of possible chronic complications and additional clinical research, to elucidate the underlying immunological pathogenesis and possible genetic predisposition is crucial.","Hoste, L.; Van Paemel, R.; Haerynck, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20173641v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20173641v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True

Methods and Findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes. Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","Chang, R.; Elhusseiny, K.

12,Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter,"Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","Ostapenko, A.; McPeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176073v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True

14,On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data,"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible- Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.

15,Interobserver Agreement of Lung Ultrasound Findings of COVID-19,"Background: Lung ultrasound (LUS) may be used in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with COVID-19. An abnormal LUS is associated with increased risk for ICU admission in COVID-19. Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. Research Question: What is the interrater reliability of lung ultrasound findings in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: This study was conducted at conducted at two academic medical centers between 03/2020-06/2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n=4; emergency medicine: n=5) independently evaluated n=20 LUS scans (n=180 independent observations) collected from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values were used to calculate IRR. Results: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), >=3 B-lines observed (K=0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (K=0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (K=0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). Interpretation: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","Kumar, A.; Weng, Y.; Graglia, S.; Chung, S.; Duanmu, Y.; Lalani, F.; Gandhi, K.; Lobo, V.; Jensen, T.; Kugler, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176156v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20176156v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
16,Abnormal Upregulation of Cardiovascular Disease Biomarker PLA2G7 Induced by Proinflammatory Macrophages in COVID-19 patients,"BACKGROUND. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggers distinct patterns of pneumonia progression with multiorgan disease, calling for cell- and/or tissue-type specific host injury markers. METHODS. An integrated hypothesis-free single biomarker analysis framework was performed on nasal swabs (n=484) from patients with COVID-19 in GSE152075. The origin of candidate biomarker was assessed in single-cell RNA data (GSE145926). The candidate biomarker was validated in a cross-sectional cohort (n=564) at both nucletide and protein levels. RESULTS. Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was identified as a candidate biomarker in COVID-19. PLA2G7 was predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, PLA2G7 was found in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, rather than patients suffered mild H1N1 influenza infection. The positive rates of PLA2G7 ranging from 29.37% to 100.00% were positively correlated with not only viral loads in patients with COVID-19 but also severity of pneumonia in non COVID-19 patients. Although Ct values of PLA2G7 in severe pneumonia was siginificantly lower than that in moderate pneumonia (P=7.2e-11), no differences were observed in moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 between severe pneumonia without COVID-19 (P=0.81). Serum protein levels of PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), were further found to be elevated and beyond the upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, especially among the re-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS. We firstly identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 patients at both nucletide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in COVID-19 patients. PLA2G7 could be a hallmark of COVID-19 for monitoring disease progress and therapeutic response.","LI, Y.; JIANG, Y.; ZHANG, Y.; LI, N.; YIN, Q.; LIU, L.; LV, X.; LIU, Y.; LI, A.; FANG, B.; LI, J.; YE, H.; YANG, G.; CUI, X.; LIU, Y.; QU, Y.; LI, C.; LI, J.; LI, D.; WANG, S.; GAI, Z.; ZHAN, F.; LIANG, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175505v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175505v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
17,Protection Level and Reusability of a Modified Full-Face Snorkel Mask as Alternative Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 drastically increased pressure on medical resources and highlighted the need for rapidly available, large-scale and low-cost personal protective equipment (PPE). In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. As the mask covers the eyes, mouth and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost and helps addressing the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles below 500 nm.","Schmitt, J.; Jones, L.

18,Colorimetric Test for Fast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Throat Swabs,"Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","Della Ventura, B.; Cennamo, M.; Minopoli, A.; Campanile, R.; Bolletti Censi, S.; Terracciano, D.; Portella, G.; Velotta, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175489v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,True
19,Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance of over ten thousand health care workers in the Providence Oregon cohort.,"ABSTRACT Frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are a high-risk population for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019 asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101 seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing, when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement, {kappa} = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","Leidner, R.; Frary, A.; Cramer, J.; Ball, D.; Weerasinghe, R.; Schmidt, M.; Jin, J.; Luzzi, V.; Saitman, A.; Young, J.

20,Behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal products among the public in response to Covid-19 in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study,"The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of drugs were identified.","Ahmed, I.; Hasan, M.; Akter, R.; Sarkar, B. K.; Rahman, M.; Sarker, M. S.; Samad, M.

21,Universal PCR and antibody testing demonstrate little to no transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural community,"Background: The absence of systematic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 has curtailed accurate appraisal of transmission intensity. Our objective was to perform case detection of an entire rural community to quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission using PCR and antibody testing. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural town of Bolinas, California (population 1,620), four weeks following shelter-in-place orders. Residents and county essential workers were tested between April 20th-24th, 2020. Prevalence by PCR and seroprevalence combining data from two forms of antibody testing were performed in parallel (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG to nucleocapsid protein and in-house IgG ELISA to the receptor binding domain). Results: Of 1,891 participants, 1,312 were confirmed Bolinas residents (>80% community ascertainment). Zero participants were PCR positive. Assuming 80% sensitivity, it would have been unlikely to observe these results (p<0.05) if there were >3 active infections in the community. Based on antibody results, estimated prevalence of prior infection was 0.16% (95% CrI: 0.02%, 0.46%). Seroprevalence estimates using only one of the two tests would have been higher, with greater uncertainty. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive result on both tests was 99.11% (95% CrI: 95.75%, 99.94%), compared to PPV 44.19%-63.32% (95% CrI range 3.25%-98.64%) if only one test was utilized. Conclusions: Four weeks following shelter-in-place, active and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rural Northern California community was extremely rare. In this low prevalence setting, use of two antibody tests increased the PPV and precision of seroprevalence estimates.","Appa, A.; Takahashi, S.; Rodriguez-Barraquer, I.; Chamie, G.; Sawyer, A.; CLIAHUB Consortium,; Duarte, E.; Hakim, J.; Turcios, K.; Vinden, J.; Janson, O.; Manglik, A.; Peluso, M.

22,SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Correlate with Resolution of RNAemia But Are Short-Lived in Patients with Mild Illness,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, could offer protective immunity, and may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 625 serial plasma samples from 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 170 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.","Röltgen, K.; Wirz, O. F.; Stevens, B.

Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of particular cytokines towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical management. Methods: Scientific literature was searched to identify 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN-{gamma} between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. Results: Out of the 6 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across the studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~ 92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates. Conclusions: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis.","Dhar, S.

24,The influence of climate factors on COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia: An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model,"Background A unique concern pertaining to the spread of COVID-19 across countries is the asymmetry of risk and the irrational fear of a new pandemic and its possible serious consequences. This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example. Methodology/Principal Findings Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables. For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state, Conclusions/Significance The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the community.","Naing, C.; Ni, H.; Aung, H.

25,"SARS-Cov-2-, HIV-1-, Ebola-neutralizing and anti-PD1 clones are predisposed","Antibody repertoire refers to the totality of the superbly diversified antibodies within an individual to cope with the vast array of possible pathogens. Despite this extreme diversity, antibodies of the same clonotype, namely public clones, have been discovered among individuals. Although some public clones could be explained by antibody convergence, public clones in naive repertoire or virus-neutralizing clones from not infected people were also discovered. All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals. Our result demonstrated that these clones are predisposed in the human antibody repertoire and may exert critical functions during particular immunological stimuli and consequently benefit the donors.

26,Evaluation of commercially available immuno-magnetic agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for rapid point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Fast, accurate and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. Methods: The study included 35 plasma samples from 22 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non COVID-19 plasma samples.

Results: Of the 35 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 29 (82.9%) were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples (82.9%) were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA+IgM and 73% IgG by IMA and 73% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 90%. Specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG.

27,"SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Antagonizes Type I and III Interferons by Targeting Multiple Components of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING Signaling Pathways","Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a catastrophic effect on human health and society. Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, L.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, J.; Nan, M.-L.; Wang, P.-H.; Gao, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
28,The differential immune responses to COVID-19 in peripheral and lung revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Understanding the mechanism that leads to immune dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV2 virus is crucial to develop treatment for severe COVID-19. Here, using single cell RNA-seq, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients, and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DC) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8+ T cell subsets, compared to health controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4+ T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2 and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients' peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4 and CCL5 etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the patients' lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19.","Xu, G.; Qi, F.; Li, H.; Yang, Q.; Wang, H.; Wang, X.; Liu, X.; Zhao, J.; Liao, X.; Liu, Y.; Amit, I.; Liu, L.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175638v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175638v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
29,A pilot study to see any Change of the Nasal and Oropharyngeal Microbiota with Prolonged Use of Medical Masks during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has played havoc on the healthcare system and society. Many international guidelines have put forward various measures to control the spread and, using various quality masks seems to be the most important amongst them. This was a cross-sectional pilot study to see any alterations in the bacterial flora of the nasal and the oropharyngeal (OP) microbiota with the use of medical masks over prolonged periods during this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected using proper international guidelines from 30 healthy healthcare workers matching pre-set inclusion criteria, who gave written informed consent. The swabs were used for gram stain as well as culture and sensitivity analysis using standard methods. Results: In general, we found that the oropharyngeal microflora harboured a more diverse population of bacteria (n=13) than the nasal microflora (n=5). The predominant bacterial flora was found to Staphylococcus epidermidis in the nasal cavity and Streptococcus viridans in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was no growth in 8 (26.68%) samples of oropharynx and 3 (10%) of nasal samples, with one patient having no growth in both the samples. The commonest resistant antibiotic from both the cavity cultures was benzylpenicillin (nasal flora 80% and OP flora 47.37%). Conclusion: This small pilot study has shown a reassuring aspect of no change in the typical bacterial microflora species of the nasal and OP cavity with prolonged use of medical masks. This is the first study to show this convincing evidence during the COVID-19 outbreak and also in healthy healthcare workers who have to wear masks over long durations.","Roy, S.; Majumder, P.; Bhattacharjee, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175067v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175067v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
30,ESTIMATING PREVALENCE AND TIME COURSE OF SARS-CoV-2 BASED ON NEW HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND PCR TESTS,"Data posted in the COVID 19 tracking website for RT-PCR (PCR) results and hospital admissions are used to estimate the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States (1). Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests due to their initially limited test numbers and application as a diagnostic, instead of a surveying tool. As of July 31, the United States' cumulative recovered population is estimated at 47% or 155 million. The remaining susceptible population is 53%, or 47% excepting the 6% infectious population. The estimated mortality rate of the cumulative recovered population is 0.09% death per case. New York and Massachusetts show SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 87% and 55%, respectively. Likewise, each state exhibits relatively low current positive PCR results at 1 % and 1.7%. Also, these states show about twice the mortality rate of the nation. Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered population percent around 40%, higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 7% to 13%. A higher recovered population mitigates the current positive value attainable by limiting the infectivity rate Re. This approach provides an alternate source of information on the pandemic's full time course since the serological testing only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease. The deficiency of serological testing to estimate the recovered population is made even more acute due to the large proportion of asymptomatic and sub-clinical cases in the COVID-19 pandemic","Gonzalez, J.

Objectives: To assess the incidence of pulmonary cavitation and describe its characteristics and evolution. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 was undertaken and imaging reviewed to identify patients who developed pulmonary cavitation. Results: Twelve out of 689 (1.7%) patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 developed pulmonary cavitation, comprising 3.3% (n=12/359) of those with COVID-19 pneumonia, and 11% (n=12/110) of those admitted to the intensive care unit. We describe the imaging characteristics of the cavitation and present the clinical, pharmacological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters for these patients. In this cohort six patients have died while another remains critically ill and unlikely to survive.

32,Specific Dynamic Variations in the Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Subsets in COVID-19 and Severe Influenza A Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study,"Background: Both COVID-19 and influenza A contribute to increased mortality among the elderly and those with existing comorbidities. Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration. Methods: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). Results: We reviewed the patients' data of 110 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe COVID-19, 19 Severe COVID-19 and 43 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.93*109/L, 0.84*109/L vs 1.78*109/L, P < 0.0001) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of both severe patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1-4). Conclusions: Our study indicates lymphopenia to be associated with disease severity and suggests the plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe COVID-19 and influenza A.","Zhang, F.; Qian, F.; Gao, G.; Song, Y.; Xu, Y.; Wang, A.; Wang, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, M.; Ma, X.; Zhao, T.; Guo, X.; Chen, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175455v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175455v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
33,Hydroxychloroquine Safety Outcome within Approved Therapeutic Protocol for COVID-19 Outpatients in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Healthcare systems globally has been challenged following the COVID-19 pandemic, since late 2019. Multiple approaches and strategies have been performed to relieve the pressure and support existing healthcare systems. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the National Healthcare System. Since the 5th of June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics were established across Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 2,733 eligible patients subjected to MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine and zinc) and revisited the clinics within 3-7 days after treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. The data was collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with that of the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network, HESN) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) Committee. Results: Majority of the cases were males (70.4%). Upon reassessing the studied participants within 3-7 days, 240 patients (8.8%) discontinued the treatment protocol because of the development of side effects (4.1%) and for non-clinical reasons in the remaining (4.7%). Medication side effects overall were reported among (6.7%) of all studied participants, including mainly cardiovascular adverse events (2.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (2.4%). No Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death were reported among these patients. Conclusion: In our study, results show that the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients in mild to moderate cases in an outpatient setting, within the protocol recommendation and inclusion/exclusion criteria, is safe, highly tolerable, and with minimum side effects.","Mohana, A.; Suliman, T.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; Alkhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; Almohaizeie, A.; AboGazalah, F.; AbdulKareem, K.; AlGhofaili, F.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175752v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175752v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
34,COVID-19 among nursing staff: Settings and regional differences,"Purpose This study was carried out to describe settings of and regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 among nursing staff, analysing COVID-19 symptoms, testing and diagnosis procedures. Design We used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020. Methods The survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g. age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19 testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis methods to calculate differences. Findings More than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals. In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent testing were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions Only 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society. Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they did not experience/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings. Clinical Relevance Providing insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates, decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity and mortality.","Hoedl, M.; Eglseer, D.; Bauer, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174797v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True

Here, we present a multi-compartmental model that fits the epidemiological data for eleven countries, despite the reduced number of fitting parameters. This model consistently explains the data for the daily infected, recovered, and dead over the first six months of the pandemic. The good quality of the fits makes it possible to explore different scenarios and evaluate the impact of both individual and collective behaviors and government- level decisions to mitigate the epidemic. We identify robust alternatives to lockdown, such as self- protection measures, and massive testing. Furthermore, communication and risk perception are fundamental to modulate the success of different strategies. The fitting/simulation tool is publicly available for use and test of other models, allowing for comparisons between different underlying assumptions, mitigation measures, and policy recommendations.","Beira, M.

36,SARS-Coronavirus-2 nucleocapsid protein measured in blood using a Simoa ultra-sensitive immunoassay differentiates COVID-19 infection with high clinical sensitivity.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies and economies worldwide. Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum / plasma samples. The limit of detection (LoD) estimated by titration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.2 pg/ml, corresponding to 0.05 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) per ml, > 2000 times more sensitive than current EUA approved antigen tests. No cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses, including hCoV229E, hCoVOC43, hCoVNL63, Influenza A or Influenza B, was observed. We detected elevated N-protein concentrations in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals using capillary blood from a finger-stick collection device. The Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay has the potential to detect COVID-19 infection via antigen in blood with similar or better performance characteristics of molecular tests, while also enabling at home and point of care sample collection.","Shan, D.; Johnson, J.

37,The effect of smoking on COVID-19 symptom severity: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2), and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019, but quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic. While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Non-severe cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors. Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P <.008). In 10.7% (978/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases. Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.","Gulsen, A.; Arpinar Yigitbas, B.; Uslu, B.; Droemann, D.; Kilinc, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True

Early implementation of lockdown protocols were useful to control certain parameters of transmission dynamics, but the numbers are consistently increasing in later months. India population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.","MALI REDDY, B.

41,GIS-based spatial modeling to identify factors affecting COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented shock throughout the world which leads to generate a massive social, human, and economic crisis. However, there is a lack of research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R square value of 78.6%.

43,"Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care Mental Health Services: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional Timeseries of Electronic Healthcare Records","Introduction. There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","Bauer-Staeb, C. M. M.; Davis, A.; Smith, T.

Obtained results show the LRC character in the most sequences; except some sequences where the anti-correlated or the Classical Brownian motion character is observed, demonstrating that the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus undergoes mutation from a country to another or in the same country, they reveals also the complexity and the heterogeneous genome structure organization far from the equilibrium and the self-organization.

45,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations on Protein Structures and Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions,"Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, S.; Tian, C.; Liu, P.; Guo, D.; Zheng, W.; Huang, X.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,False
46,"Design of a highly thermotolerant, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment","Virtually all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in clinical testing are stored in a refrigerated or frozen state prior to use. This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 200mg/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, and upto 70{degrees}C in solution. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.","Malladi, S.

48,A SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody protects from lung pathology in a COVID-19 hamster model,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 [A] revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.","Kreye, J.; Reincke, S.

49,Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, D.

50,High titers of multiple antibody isotypes against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and nucleoprotein associate with better neutralization.,"Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, M.

51,Superspreading as a Regular Factor of the COVID-19 Pandemic: II. Quarantine Measures and the Second Wave,"Within the framework of a two-component model of the COVID-19 epidemic, taking into account the special role of superspreaders, we consider the impact of the recovery factor and quarantine measures on the course of the epidemic, as well as the possibility of a second wave of morbidity. It is assumed that there is no long-term immunity in asymptomatic superspreaders who have under- gone the infection, and the emergence of long-term immunity in those who have undergone severe illness. It is shown that, under these assumptions, the relaxation of quarantine measures leads to the resumption of virus circulation among asymptomatic superspreaders. Depending on the charac- teristics of the quarantine, its removal may or may not lead to a renewed wave of daily morbidity. A criterion for the occurrence of repeated wave of morbidity is proposed based on the analysis of the final phase of the first wave. Based on this criterion, the repeated wave of the epidemic is predicted in New Zealand. A natural explanation is given for the decrease in lethality among the infected against the background of an absolute increase in their number.","Dimaschko, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174557v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174557v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True
52,"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","Severe COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, and dyspnoea. Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","Millar, J.

We use a novel combination of epidemiological and economic simulations for scenario calculations based on empirical evidence from Germany. Our findings suggest that a prudent opening is economically optimal, whereas costs are higher for a more extensive opening process. This rejects the view that there is a conflict with health protection. Instead, it is in the common interest of public health and the economy to relax non-pharmaceutical interventions in a manner that keeps the epidemic under control.","Dorn, F.; Khailaie, S.; Stoeckli, M.; Binder, S.

55,"Widespread testing, case isolation and contact tracing may allow safe school reopening with continued moderate physical distancing: a modeling analysis of King County, WA data","Background In late March 2020, a ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy"" order was issued in Washington State in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, a 4-phase reopening plan began. If implemented without interruptions, all types of public interactions were planned to resume by July 15. We investigated whether adjunctive prevention strategies would allow less restrictive physical distancing to avoid second epidemic waves and secure safe school reopening. Methods We developed a mathematical model, stratifying the population by age (0-19 years, 20-49 years, 50-69 years, and 70+ years), infection status (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, recovered) and treatment status (undiagnosed, diagnosed, hospitalized) to project SARS-CoV-2 transmission during and after the reopening period. The model was parameterized with demographic and contact data from King County, WA and calibrated to confirmed cases, deaths (overall and by age) and epidemic peak timing. Adjunctive prevention interventions were simulated assuming different levels of pre-COVID physical interactions (pC_PI) restored. We made several predictions related to adjunctive interventions or increased pC_PI. Results The best model fit estimated ~35% pC_PI under lockdown. Gradually restoring 75% pC_PI for all age groups between May 15-July 15 resulted in ~350 daily deaths by early September 2020. Maintaining less than 45% pC_PI was required with current testing practices to ensure low levels of daily infections and deaths. If widespread community transmission persisted, isolating the elderly does not lower daily death rates significantly. Increased testing, isolation of symptomatic infections, and contact tracing permitted 60% pC_PI without significant increases in daily deaths before September, although this strategy may not be sufficient to eliminate community transmission. This combination strategy also allowed opening of schools with <15 daily deaths. Inpatient antiviral treatment reduces deaths significantly without lowering cases or hospitalizations. Conclusions We predict that widespread implementation of ""test and isolate"" policy alone is insufficient to prevent the rapid re-emergence of SARS CoV-2 without moderate physical distancing. However, widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation would allow relaxation of physical distancing, as well as opening of schools, without a surge in local cases and deaths.","Bracis, C.; Burns, E.; Moore, M.; Swan, D.; Reeves, D.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in-person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19.

58,"Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: a study of 62,354 COVID-19 cases","Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment.","Taquet, M.; Luciano, S.; Geddes, J.

We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","Vecino-Ortiz, A. I.; Villanueva Congote, J.; Zapata Bedoya, S.; Cucunuba, Z.

60,Inhibition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 main protease by tafenoquine in vitro,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken a huge toll on human lives and the global economy. Therefore, effective treatments against this disease are urgently needed. Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the -helical content of Mpro, which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.","Chen, Y.; Yang, W.-H.; Huang, L.-M.; Wang, Y.-C.; Yang, C.-S.; Liu, Y.-L.; Hou, M.-H.; Tsai, C.-L.; Chou, Y.-Z.; Huang, B.-Y.; Hung, C.-F.; Hung, Y.-L.; Chen, J.-S.; Chiang, Y.-P.; Cho, D.-Y.; Jeng, L.-B.; Tsai, C.-H.; Hung, M.-C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.250258v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.250258v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,False
61,In plain sight: the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in COVID-19 pathogenesis and therapeutics.,"Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases. These proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","Oguntuyo, K.

62,Methylation of RNA Cap in SARS-CoV-2 captured by serial crystallography,"The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contains 29 proteins, of which 15 are nonstructural. Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5' terminus. In the methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.","Wilamowski, M.; Sherrell, D.; Minasova, G.; Kim, Y.; Shuvaloca, L.; Lavens, A.; Chard, R.; Maltseva, N.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Rosas-Lemus, M.; Saint, N.; Foster, I.

63,Pandemic danger to the deep: the risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater,"We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. Many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we highlight the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","Mathavarajah, S.; Stoddart, A.

64,Differential methylation as a mediator of COVID-19 susceptibility,"The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","Steyaert, S.; Trooskens, G.; Delanghe, J.

65,Extensive Genetic Diversity and Host Range of Rodent-borne Coronaviruses,"To better understand the genetic diversity, host association and evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) in China we analyzed a total of 696 rodents encompassing 16 different species sampled from Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","Wang, W.; Lin, X.-D.; Zhang, H.-L.; Wang, M.-R.; Guan, X.-Q.; Holmes, E.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases.

67,Metaviromic identification of genetic hotspots of coronavirus pathogenicity using machine learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major threat across the globe. Here, we developed machine learning approaches to identify key pathogenic regions in coronavirus genomes. We trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","Park, J.

68,Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","Papa, G.; Mallery, D.; Albecka, A.; Welch, L.; Cattin-Ortola, J.; Luptak, J.; Paul, D.; McMahon, H.; Goodfellow, I.

In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","Zhang, D.; Lu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues.

72,"Ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells: rapid induction, prolonged contraction, and formation of functional memory","CD8+ T cells are critical for the elimination and long-lasting protection of many viral infections, but their role in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Schulien, I.; Kemming, J.; Oberhardt, V.; Wild, K.; Seidel, L.

74,Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By T Cell Epitope Engineering,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S proteins immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the proteins native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigens structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","Ong, E.; Huang, X.; Pearce, R.; Zhang, Y.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.

Statement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","Gauttier, V.; Morello, A.; Girault, I.; Mary, C.; Belarif, L.; Desselle, A.; Wilhelm, E.; Bourquard, T.; Pengam, S.; Teppaz, G.; Thepenier, V.; Biteau, K.; De Barbeyrac, E.; Kiepferle, D.; Vasseur, B.; Le Flem, F.-X.; Debieuvre, D.; Costantini, D.; Poirier, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
76,Hydroxychloroquine: mechanism of action inhibiting SARS-CoV2 entry.,"BackgroundSARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic. Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry.

MethodsViral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 M propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains.

ResultsPropofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2.

ConclusionsWe conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ. HCQ disruption of the membrane appears to also disrupt the production of host defense peptide, hence an antimicrobial such as erythromycin could be an important combined treatment. Nonetheless erythromycin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may combine with HCQ to reduce infection.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and propofol?

Findings: Hydroxychloroquine disrupt lipid rafts similar to local and general anesthetics.

Meaning: Since lipids cluster ACE2 and facilitate viral entry, hydroxychloroquine and anesthetics appear to inhibit viral entry by disrupting the lipid clustering and ACE2 localization.","Yuan, Z.; Pavel, M.

Presently, there are no clinically approved vaccines nor drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Here in, we discovered Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a FDA approved drug and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral activity showing strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction. Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for clinical development of potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Olaleye, O.

78,SRSF protein kinases 1 and 2 are essential host factors for human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2,"Antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to treat the pandemic disease COVID-19. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. Here, we used a genome-wide loss of function CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human lung epithelial cells to identify potential host therapeutic targets. Validation of our screening hits revealed that the kinase SRPK1, together with the closely related SRPK2, were jointly essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication; inhibition of SRPK1/2 with small molecules led to a dramatic decrease (more than 100,000-fold) in SARS-CoV-2 virus production in immortalized and primary human lung cells. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that SPRK1/2 phosphorylate the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at sites highly conserved across human coronaviruses and, due to this conservation, even a distantly related coronavirus was highly sensitive to an SPRK1/2 inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that SRPK1/2-targeted therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.","Heaton, B. E.; Trimarco, J.

We designed and tested an ACE2-Fc fusion protein, which has the benefits of a long pharmacological half-life and the potential to facilitate immune clearance of the virus. Out of the concern that the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 may unintentionally alter the balance of its hormonal substrates and cause adverse cardiovascular effects in treatment, we performed a mutagenesis screening for inactivating the enzyme. Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture. This study established new ACE2-Fc candidates as antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 without potentially harmful side effects from ACE2s catalytic actions toward its vasoactive substrates.","Liu, P.; Xie, X.; Gao, L.; Jin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

The resulting {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu virus can be generated by reverse genetics and grown to high titers in cell culture. A single-dose intranasal inoculation of mice with {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu elicits serum neutralizing antibody titers against SAR-CoV-2 comparable to those observed in humans following natural infection (~1:250).

A screen of 19 small molecules and 3 biologics was conducted in cell culture and the impact of treatment on viral titer was quantified by plaque assay. The screen identified 4 FDA-approved small molecules, Maraviroc, FTY720 (Fingolimod), Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Confocal microscopy with over expressed S protein demonstrated that Maraviroc reduced the extent of S-protein mediated cell fusion as observed by fewer multinucleate cells in drug-treated cells. Mathematical modeling of drug-dependent viral multiplication dynamics revealed that prolonged drug treatment will exert an exponential decrease in viral load in a multicellular/tissue environment. Taken together, the data demonstrate that Maraviroc, Fingolimod, Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture.

83,Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 exhibit strong association with increased genome-wide mutation load,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for human cases of COVID-19, a pandemic with global impact that first emerged in late 2019. Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Oktay, Y.; Karakülah, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,False
84,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike harbours a lipid binding pocket which modulates stability of the prefusion trimer,"Large trimeric Spikes decorate SARS-CoV-2 and bind host cells via receptor binding domains (RBDs). We report a conformation in which the trimer is  locked into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the  locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the  locked form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity/pathogenicity of released virus. These results reveal a potentially druggable pocket and suggest that the natural prefusion state occludes neutralising RBD epitopes, achieving conformational shielding from antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations.

86,Suppression of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses by NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.

ImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Wang, P.; Li, X.; Kuang, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False

We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations.

Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice.

Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable.

91,Efficacy of Targeting SARS-CoV-2 by CAR-NK Cells,"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is one of greatest global pandemics in history. No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Ma, M.

92,Membrane Nanoparticles Derived from ACE2-rich Cells Block SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic worldwide necessitates the development of novel effective agents against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells. Our study demonstrates a easy-to-acheive memrbane nano-antagonist for curbing SARS-CoV-2, which enriches the existing antiviral arsenal and provides new possibilities to treat COVID-19.

93,Coronacept - a potent immunoadhesin against SARS-CoV-2,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computational analysis of mammalian ACE2 orthologues suggests various residues at the interface with the viral receptor binding domain that could facilitate tighter interaction compared to the human-ACE2. Introducing several mutations to the human-ACE2 resulted with significantly augmented affinity to the viral spike complex. This modified human-ACE2 fused to an Fc portion of an antibody makes a potent immunoadhesin that effectively targets SARS-CoV-2.,"Cohen-Dvashi, H.; Weinstein, J.; Katz, M.; Eilon, M.; Mor, Y.; Shimon, A.; Strobelt, R.; Shemesh, M.; Fleishman, S.

No clear relationship between their weakly basic and hydrophobic nature upon their activity was observed. However, the approved drugs ambroxol and ciprofloxacin showed potent activity at concentrations that are clinically relevant and within their known safety profiles, and so may provide potentially useful agents for preclinical and clinical studies in COVID-19.","Timmins, G.

95,Development of CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as a subunit vaccine against COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, T.-Y.; Lin, M.-Y.; Coffman, R. L.; Campbell, J.

96,Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, G.; Kenney, A.

97,Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.

Author summaryThe outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","Gruca, A.; Ziemska-Legiecka, J.; Jarnot, P.; Sarnowska, E.; Sarnowski, T.; Grynberg, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
98,K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","Yinda, C.

99,"Pleiotropic effect of Lactoferrin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection: in vivo, in silico and in vitro preliminary evidences","The current treatments against SARS-CoV-2 have proved so far inadequate. A potent antiviral drug is yet to be discovered. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, secreted by exocrine glands and neutrophils, possesses an antiviral activity extendable to SARS-Cov-2. We performed a randomized, prospective, interventional study assessing the role of oral and intra-nasal lactoferrin to treat mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to prevent disease evolution. Lactoferrin induced an early viral clearance and a fast clinical symptoms recovery in addition to a statistically significant reduction of D-Dimer, Interleukin-6 and ferritin blood levels. The antiviral activity of lactoferrin related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells and protein-protein docking methods, provided the direct recognition between lactoferrin and spike S, thus hindering the spike S attachment to the human ACE2 receptor and consequently virus entering into the cells. Lactoferrin can be used as a safe and efficacious natural agent to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.","Campione, E.; Lanna, C.; Cosio, T.; Rosa, L.; Conte, M.
