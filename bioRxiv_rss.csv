0,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using non-commercial RT-LAMP regents and raw samples.,"RT-LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown as a valuable approach to scale up COVID-19 diagnostics and thus contribute to limiting the spread of the disease. Here we present the optimization of highly cost-effective in-house produced enzymes, and we benchmark their performance against commercial alternatives. We explore the compatibility between multiple DNA polymerases with high strand-displacement activity and thermostable reverse transcriptases required for RT-LAMP. We optimize reaction conditions and demonstrate their applicability using both synthetic RNA and clinical patient samples. Finally, we validated the optimized RT-LAMP assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw nasopharyngeal samples from 184 patients. We anticipate that optimized and affordable reagents for RT-LAMP will facilitate the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing globally, especially in sites and settings with limited economic resources.","Alekseenko, A.; Barrett, D.; Pareja-Sanchez, Y.; Howard, R.; Strandback, E.; Ampah-Korsah, H.; Rovsnik, U.; Zuniga-Veliz, S.; Klenov, A.; Malloo, J.; Ye, S.; Liu, X.; Reinius, B.; Elsässer, S.; Nyman, T.; Sandh, G.; Yin, X.; Pelechano, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179507v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179507v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
1,Next generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from patient specimens of Nevada reveals occurrence of specific nucleotide variants at high frequency,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has a wide range of disease manifestations, including relatively mild respiratory illness to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Patients with signs of COVID-19 (fever, coughing, shortness of breath) were tested for the virus by targeting specific SARS-COV-2 genomic loci via RT-PCR using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs specimens. However, this testing does not yield genetic information required for identifying viral evolution or variants. Therefore, we sequenced 200 specimens from positively identified cases in Nevada through our robust protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly from patient's nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs. This protocol enabled identification of specific nucleotide variants including those for D614G and clade defining mutations. Additionally, these sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of public health importance occurring in the state of Nevada. Results: Our study reports a novel finding of a variant in the nsp12 (RdRp) protein at residue 323 (314aa of orf1b) to Phenylalanine (F) from Proline (P), present in the original isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-1). This 323F variant is found at a very high frequency in Northern Nevada compared to other geographic areas. Structural modeling of the RdRP interface domain indicates the P323F variant did not significantly change the protein conformation. Conclusions: Our results highlight the introduction and spread of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants at a very high frequency within a distinct geographic location. This is important for clinical and public health perspectives in understanding the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it circulates in humans.","Hartley, P.; Tillett, R.

2,Untuned antiviral immunity in COVID-19 revealed by temporal type I/III interferon patterns and flu comparison,"A central paradigm of immunity is that interferon (IFN) mediated antiviral responses precede the pro-inflammatory ones, optimizing host protection and minimizing collateral damage. Here, we report that for COVID-19 this does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 COVID-19 patients hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN production is both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they become critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 are produced before IFNs, in all patients, and persist for a prolonged time. By comparison, in 16 flu patients hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to COVID-19 and 24 milder non-hospitalized flu patients IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN are robustly induced, earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, while pro-inflammatory cytokines are only acutely and transiently produced. Notably, higher IFN-{lambda} levels in COVID-19 patients correlate with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance, and a higher IFN-{lambda}:type I IFN ratio with improved outcome of critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in COVID-19 patients correlate with longer hospitalization time and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19 contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","Galani, I.

3,Implications of the school-household network structure on SARS-CoV-2 transmission under different school reopening strategies in England,"Background School closures are a well-established non-pharmaceutical intervention in the event of infectious disease outbreaks, and have been implemented in many countries across the world, including the UK, to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.","Munday, J.

4,"Homologous and heterologous antibodies to coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 antigens in an age stratified cross-sectional serosurvey in a large tertiary hospital in The Netherlands","Understanding the coronavirus (CoV) antibody landscape in relation to disease and susceptibility is critical for modelling of steps in the next phase during the current covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020, during the first month of the epidemic in The Netherlands, we performed cross sectional studies at two time points amongst patients of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, to assess the presence of antibodies against seasonal human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1), emerging zoonotic coronaviruses (SARS, MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 in nine different age groups. We observed minimal SARS-CoV-2 reactivity early March (0.7% of sera), increasing to 3.0%, four weeks later, suggesting probably undetected cases during this early phase of the epidemic. Antibody responses were mostly coronavirus species specific at young age, but possible cross-reactivity between human seasonal CoVs was observed with increasing age.","Westerhuis, B.

5,Prevalence and outcome of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients: a national VA study,"Background: Emerging data suggest variability in susceptibility and outcome to Covid-19 infection. Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15%) compared to white (5.5%; P<.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.7%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.","Fillmore, N.

6,"Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel biomarker to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a novel inflammatory marker, has been suggested to be able to predict the severity of COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","Simadibrata, D.

7,Examining the status of improved air quality due to COVID-19 lockdown and an associated reduction in anthropogenic emissions,"Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world. Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%), Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo (17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period. Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $), Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $), Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million $), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall economic impact of air pollution on human welfare. Therefore, research that broadens the scope of valuation in environmental capitals needs to be initiated for exploring the importance of proper monetary valuation in natural capital accounting.","Sannigrahi, S.; Molter, A.; Kumar, P.; Zhang, Q.; Basu, B.; Basu, A.

8,Impaired cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response in elderly COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a T cell response that most likely contributes to virus control in COVID-19 patients, but may also induce immunopathology. Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients. Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.","Westmeier, J.; Paniskaki, K.; Karaköse, Z.; Werner, T.; Sutter, K.; Dolff, S.; Overbeck, M.; Limmer, A.; Liu, J.; Zheng, X.; Brenner, T.; Berger, M.

9,"Health Disparities and COVID-19: A Retrospective Study Examining Individual and Community Factors Causing Disproportionate COVID-19 Outcomes in Cook County, Illinois, March 16-May 31, 2020","Background: Early data from the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that the disease has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color causing higher infection and mortality rates within those communities. Methods: This study used demographic data from the 2018 US census estimates, mortality data from the Cook County Medical Examiners office, and testing results from the Illinois Department of Public Health to perform both bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to explore the role race plays in COVID-19 outcomes at the individual and community levels. Results: Principal findings show that: 1) while Black Americans make up 22% of Cook County population, they account for 36% of the county COVID-19 related deaths; 2) the average age of death from COVID-19 is seven years younger for minorities compared to Non-Hispanic White (White) decedents; 3) minorities were more likely than Whites to have seven of the top 10 co-morbidities at death; 4) residents of predominantly minority areas were twice as likely to test positive for COVID-19 (p = 0.0001, IRR 1.94, 95% CI 1.50, 2.50) than residents of predominantly White areas; and 5) residents of predominantly minority areas were 1.43 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than those in predominantly White areas (p = 0.03). Conclusions: There are notable differences in COVID-19 related outcomes between racial and ethnic groups at individual and community levels.

10,Using symptom-based case predictions to identify host genetic factors that contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility,"Epidemiological and genetic studies on COVID-19 are hindered by inconsistent and limited testing policies to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to predict potential COVID-19 cases using cross-sectional self-reported disease-related symptoms. Using a previously reported COVID-19 prediction model, we show that it is possible to conduct a GWAS on predicted COVID-19 which benefits from a larger sample size in order to gain new insights into the genetic susceptibility of the disease. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that genetic variants for other viral infectious diseases do not overlap with COVID-19 susceptibility and that severity of COVID-19 may have a different genetic architecture compared to COVID-19 susceptibility. Our findings demonstrate the added value of using self-reported symptom assessments to quickly monitor novel endemic viral outbreaks in a scenario of limited testing. Should there be another outbreak of a novel infectious disease, then we recommend repeatedly collecting data of disease-related symptoms.","van Blokland, I. V.; Lanting, P.; Ori, A. P.; Vonk, J.

11,Randomized placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: The first cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China. No antiviral treatment options are currently available with proven clinical efficacy. However, preliminary findings from phase III trials suggest that remdesivir is an effective and safe treatment option for COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Objective: The aim of the present meta-analysis is to investigate whether remdesivir is effective for treating COVID-19 including reduced in-hospital adverse events, oxygen support, and mortality rates. Methods: Using PRISMA reporting guidelines, a review was conducted from January 1 2020 until 6 August 2020 with MeSH terms including COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID, remdesivir, adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, Veklury using Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. A modified Delphi process was used to include the studies and ensure that the objectives were addressed (Appendix A). Using dichotomous data for select values, the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated applying Mantel Haenszel (M-H) random-effects method in Review Manager 5.4. Results: Randomized controlled trials pooled in 2,429 participants with 41.6% (n=1011) in the remdesivir group and 58.4% (n=1,418) in the placebo group. The placebo group had a higher risk of mortality as compared to the intervention group with significant odds ratio (OR=0.61) (95% confidence interval of 0.45-0.83; P=0.001). There was moderate heterogeneity among the studies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that remdesivir extends clinical benefits by reducing mortality, adverse events and oxygen support in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients. Concerted efforts and further randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to examine the potency of anti-viral drugs and immune-pathological host responses contributing to severity of COVID-19.","Sarfraz, A.; Sarfraz, Z.; Sanchez-Gonalez, M.

12,SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in educational settings: cross-sectional analysis of clusters and outbreaks in England,"BACKGROUND There are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in educational settings. This information is critical for policy makers and practitioners to ensure the safety of staff, students and the wider community during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance following the reopening of educational settings during the summer mini-term on 01 June 2020. COVID-19 related situations in educational settings across England were reviewed daily and followed-up until 31 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreak rates were calculated for staff and students attending early year settings, primary and secondary schools during June 2020. FINDINGS There were 67 single confirmed cases, 4 co-primary cases and 30 COVID-19 outbreaks during June 2020, with a strong correlation between number of outbreaks and regional COVID-19 incidence (0.51 outbreaks for each SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 in the community; p=0.001). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon across all educational settings. Staff members had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to students in any educational setting, and the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff. The probable transmission direction for the 30 confirmed outbreaks was: staff-to-staff (n=15), staff-to-student (n=7), student-to-staff (n=6) and student-to-student (n=2). INTERPRETATION SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the first month after the easing of national lockdown in England. The strong correlation with regional SARS-CoV-2 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Additional interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff members. FUNDING None.","Ismail, S. A.; Saliba, V.; Lopez Bernal, J. A.; Ramsay, M. E.; Ladhani, S.

13,Control Strategies against COVID-19 in China: Significance of Effective Testing in the Long Run,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is reasonably contained in China. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of different containment strategies in halting the pandemic spread in both short- and long-term. We combined a networked metapopulation SEIR model featuring undocumented infections, actual mobility data and Bayesian inference to simulate the counterfactual outbreak scenarios removing each one or a combination of the following three policies in place: i) city lockdowns, ii) intercity travel bans, and iii) testing, detection, and quarantine. Our estimates revealed that 11.4% [95% credible interval (CI): 9.7-13.0%] of the infected cases were unidentified before January 23, 2020. The rate grew to 92.5% [95% credible interval (CI): 85.9-94.5%] in early March, thanks to the boost in coronavirus testing capacity. We show that increasing the detection rate of infections from 11.4% to 92.5% alone would explain 75% of the reduction in infections from a no-policy baseline by March 15, 2020. The most pronounced policy implication is that city lockdowns appeared to be the more effective intervention in the short-run but effective testing is essential in containing the COVID-19 spread in the long run. By March 15, restoring within-city personal contact to its 2019 level would lead to a 678% growth in infections with all the other interventions remaining unaffected. Removing intercity travel restrictions and effective detection measures would lead to 3% and 477% growth, respectively. Extending the time horizon to July 15, the counterfactual increase in infections would become 581%, 3% and 30000% had the three classes of interventions been lifted individually.","Lin, Y.; Peng, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179697v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179697v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
14,"The impact of COVID-19 on acute Trauma and Orthopaedic referrals and surgery in the UK: the ""golden peak weeks"" of the first national multi-centre observational study. The COVid-Emergency Related Trauma and orthopaedics (COVERT) Collaborative","Objectives: This is the first national study observing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic trauma with respect to referrals, operative caseload and mortality during the first six weeks (namely the ""golden peak weeks"") following the introduction of the national social distancing and lockdown measures from mid-March 2020. Design: A longitudinal, national, multi-centre, retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted for the first six weeks from March 17, 2020 from start of the national social distancing and then lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 as a comparative baseline. Setting: Hospitals from seven major urban cities were recruited around the UK, including London, representing a comprehensive national picture of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown at its peak. Participants: A total of 4840 clinical encounters were initially recorded. Exclusion criterion consisted of spinal pathology only. Post-exclusion, 4668 clinical encounters were recorded and analysed within the two timeframes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included the number of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, patient demographics, mortality rates, and the proportion of patients contracting COVID-19. Secondary outcomes consisted of the mechanism of injury, type of operative intervention and proportion of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia utilised. Demographics for each patient was recorded along with underlying medical co-morbidities. Sub-group analysis compared mortalities between both cohorts. Statistical analyses included mean (+/-SD), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance (p = 0.05). Results: During the COVID-19 period there was a 34% reduction in acute orthopaedic trauma referrals compared to 2019 (1792 down to 1183 referrals), and 29.5% less surgical interventions (993 down to 700 operations). The mortality rate significantly (both statistically and clinically) more than doubled for both risk and odds ratios during the COVID period in all referrals (1.3% vs 3.8%, p=0.0005) and in those undergoing operative intervention (2.2% vs 4.9%, p=0.004). Moreover, mortality due to COVID-related complications (versus non-COVID causes) had greater odds by a factor of at least 20 times. The odds ratios of road traffic accidents, sporting injuries, infection, and lower limb injuries were significantly less (by a third to a half) during the COVID period; albeit, the odds of sustaining neck of femur fractures and having falls <1.5m increased by more than 50%. For the operative cohorts, there was a greater odds of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia (including those with superimposed regional blocks) by three-quarters as well as doubling of the odds of a Consultant acting as the primary surgeon. Nevertheless, the odds of open reduction and internal fixation reduced by a quarter whereas removal of metalwork or foreign bodies reduced by three-quarters. Six-week Kaplan-Meier survival probability analysis confirmed those patients with neck of femur fracture and pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were most at risk of mortality during the COVID-19 era. Conclusion: Although there was a reduction of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, the mortality rate still more than doubled in odds during the peak of the pandemic compared to the same time interval one year ago. Elderly patients with neck of femur fractures and existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities were at the highest risk stratification for mortality. This was the first national study to assess impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute Orthopaedic trauma and it will aid clinicians in counselling trauma patients of the increased risk of mortality during the era of COVID-19 as well as acting as a risk-prediction tool influencing policymaking as the pandemic continues with potential subsequent waves. Further studies after the lifting of the lockdown are also required to observe for return of standard practice.","Sugand, K.; COVERT Collaborative,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179770v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179770v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
15,Impact of population density on Covid 19 infected and mortality rate in India,"The residents living in areas with high population density, such as big or metropolitan cities have higher probability to come into close contact with others and consequently any contagious disease are expected to spread rapidly in dense areas. However, recently after analyzing Covid-19 cases in US researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, London school of economics and IZA Institute of Labor Economics conclude that spread of Covid-19 is not linked with population density. Here we investigate the influence of population density on Covid-19 spread and related mortality in the context of India. We find some correlation between Covid-19 spread and population density which becomes more pronounced as statistics improves.","Bhadra, A.; Mukherjee, A.; Sarkar, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179416v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179416v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
16,Potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses are Associated with Better Prognosis in Hospital Inpatient COVID-19 Disease,"COVID-19 continues to cause a pandemic, having infected more than 20 million people globally. Successful elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will require an effective vaccine. However, the immune correlates of infection are currently poorly understood. While neutralizing antibodies are believed to be essential for protection against infection, the contribution of the neutralizing antibody response to resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been defined. In this study the antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins were investigated in a UK patient cohort, using optimised immunoassays and a retrovirus-based pseudotype entry assay. It was discovered that in severe COVID-19 infections an early antibody response to both antigens was associated with improved prognosis of infection. While not all SARS-CoV-2-reactive sera were found to possess neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing potency of sera was found to be greater in patients who went on to resolve infection, compared with those that died from COVID-19. Furthermore, viral genetic variation in spike protein was found to influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Infection with the recently described spike protein variant 614G produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to viruses possessing the 614D variant. These findings support the assertion that vaccines targeting generation of neutralizing antibodies may be useful at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 at time of diagnosis will be a useful addition to the diagnostic toolkit, enabling stratification of clinical intervention for severe COVID-19 disease.","Tighe, P.

17,Evidence for treatment with estradiol for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BACKGROUND Given that an individual's age and gender are strongly predictive of COVID-19 outcomes, do such factors imply anything about preferable therapeutic options? METHODS An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-menopausal (>50 years). RESULTS The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17{beta}-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the human ACE2 protein--which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry--propensity score matching was performed for the women's sub-cohort, comparing users versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels. CONCLUSIONS As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.","Seeland, U.; Coluzzi, F.; Simmaco, M.; Mura, C.; Bourne, P.

18,The unintended consequences of inconsistent pandemic control policies,"Controlling the spread of COVID-19 -- even after a licensed vaccine is available -- requires the effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing, etc.. To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the United States of America (US), some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our mathematical model reveals that, across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than no measures at all. In the most severe cases, individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring jurisdictions can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.","Althouse, B.

19,Modeling Hospital Energy and Economic Costs for COVID-19 Infection Control Interventions,"The objective of this study was to assess the energy demand and economic cost of two hospital-based COVID-19 infection control interventions. The intervention control measures evaluated include use of negative pressure (NP) treatment rooms and xenon pulsed ultraviolet (XP-UV) infection control equipment. After projecting COVID-19 hospitalizations, a Hospital Energy Model and Infection De-escalation Models are applied to quantify increases in energy demand and reductions in secondary infections. The scope of the interventions consisted of implementing NP in 11, 22, and 44 rooms (at small, medium, and large hospitals) while the XP-UV equipment was used eight, nine, and ten hours a day, respectively. The annum kilowatt-hours (kWh) for NP (and costs were at $0.1015 per kWh) were 116,700 ($11,845), 332,530 ($33,752), 795,675 ($80,761) for small, medium, and large hospitals ($1,077, $1,534, $1,836 added annum energy cost per NP room). For XP-UV, the annum kilowatt-hours and costs were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. There are other initial costs associated with the purchase and installation of the equipment, with XP-UV having a higher initial cost. XP-UV had a greater reduction in secondary COVID-19 infections in large and medium hospitals. NP rooms had a greater reduction in secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission in small hospitals. Early implementation of interventions can result in realized cost savings through reduced hospital-acquired infections.","Squire, M.

20,"Comparing the COVID-19 pandemic in space and over time in Europe, using numbers of deaths, crude rates and adjusted mortality trend ratios","Background Since COVID19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.","Gallo, V.; Chiodini, P.; Bruzzese, D.; Kondilis, E.; Howdon, D.; Mierau, J.; Bhopal, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179218v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179218v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
21,Correlation of National and Healthcare Workers COVID-19 Infection Data; Implications for Large-scale Viral Testing Programs,"Time analysis of the course of an infectious disease epidemic is a critical way to understand the dynamics of pathogen transmission and the effect of population scale interventions. Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, D.; Mac Aonghusa, P.; O'Shea, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
22,Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2,"Previous work has indicated that contact tracing and isolation of index case and quarantine of potential secondary cases can, in concert with physical distancing measures, be an effective strategy for reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, contacts traced manually through the NHS Test and Trace scheme in the UK are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were exposed to the index case, which represents the upper bound for the incubation period. However, following previous work on screening strategies for air travellers it may be possible that this quarantine period could be reduced if combined with PCR testing. Adapting the simulation model for contact tracing, we find that quarantine periods of at least 10 days combined with a PCR test on day 9 may largely emulate the results from a 14-day quarantine period in terms of the averted transmission potential from secondary cases (72% (95%UI: 3%, 100%) vs 75% (4%, 100%), respectively). These results assume the delays from testing index cases' and tracing their contacts are minimised (no longer than 4.5 days on average). If secondary cases are traced and quarantined 1 day earlier on average, shorter quarantine periods of 8 days with a test on day 7 (76% (7%, 100%)) approach parity with the 14 day quarantine period with a 1 day longer delay to the index cases' test. However, the risk of false-negative PCR tests early in a traced case's infectious period likely prevents the use of testing to reduce quarantine periods further than this, and testing immediately upon tracing, with release if negative, will avert just 17% of transmission potential on average. In conclusion, the use of PCR testing is an effective strategy for reducing quarantine periods for secondary cases, while still reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially if delays in the test and trace system can be reduced, and may improve quarantine compliance rates.","Quilty, B.

23,How do socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviours?,"This study assesses how socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence protection behaviours during a pandemic, with protection behaviours being assessed through three perspectives: social distancing, personal protection behaviour and social responsibility awareness. The COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored and compared based on the social-demographic and personal attributes of individuals. Using a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and exploiting both Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and regression analysis, the study notes that socio-demographic and personal attributes of individuals indeed shape the subjective prevention actions and thereby the control of the spread of a pandemic. Three socio-demographic attributes (sex, marital family status and having children) appear to have played an influential role in abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours by Japanese citizens, especially with women having children being noted more conscious than the male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact especially concerning social distancing and personal protection behaviour. Among the personality attributes, smoking behaviour appeared as a contributing factor with non-smokers or less-frequent smokers more compliant to the protection behaviours. Overall, the findings imply the need of public policy campaigning to account for variations in protection behaviour due to socio-demographic and personal attributes during a pandemic.","Uddin, S.; Imam, T.; Khushi, M.; Khan, A.; Moni, M.

Only 10 patients were physically active and fulfil WHO physical activity requirement (Age 30 years, Mass 77 kg, Stature 176 cm). There was a significant difference in recovery time between active and inactive patients (P=0.00) with active patients recovery 2.7 times faster than inactive patients. Active patients showed a lower BMI level (p=0.043).

Though this tool is built on top of projections of the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is agnostic as to which model--of which many are available--provides these projections. The tool combines COVID-19 patient census projections with information like staffing ratios and frequency of patient contact to provide projections of the number of items of key types of PPE needed under three built-in conservation scenarios: standard, contingency, and crisis. Users are also able to customize the tool to the specifics of their hospital and design custom conservation policies.","Lum, K.; Johndrow, J.; Cardone, A.; Fuchs, B.; Cotner, C.; Jew, O.; Parikh, R.; Draugelis, M.; Luong, T.; Hanish, A.; Weissman, G.

26,Associations of comorbidities and medications with COVID-19 outcome: A retrospective analysis of real-world evidence data,"Background: Hundreds of thousands of deaths have already been recorded for patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; aka COVID-19). Understanding whether there is a relationship between comorbidities and COVID-19 positivity will not only impact clinical decisions, it will also allow an understanding of how better to define the long-term complications in the groups at risk. In turn informing national policy on who may benefit from more stringent social distancing and shielding strategies. Furthermore, understanding the associations between medications and certain outcomes may also further our understanding of indicators of vulnerability in people with COVID-19 and co-morbidities. Methods: Electronic healthcare records (EHR) from two London hospitals were analysed between 1st January and 27th May 2020. 5294 patients presented to the hospitals in whom COVID status was formally assessed; 1253 were positive for COVID-19 and 4041 were negative. This dataset was analysed to identify associations between comorbidities and medications, separately and two outcomes: (1) presentation with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis, and (2) inpatient death following COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Medications were analysed in different time windows of prescription to differentiate between short-term and long-term medications. All analyses were done with controls (without co-morbidity) matched for age, sex, and number of admissions, and a robustness approach was conducted to only accept results that consistently appear when the analysis is repeated with different proportions of the data. Results: We observed higher COVID-19 positive presentation for patients with hypertension (1.7 [1.3-2.1]) and diabetes (1.6 [1.2-2.1]). We observed higher inpatient COVID-19 mortality for patients with hypertension (odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.9-3.9]), diabetes (2.2 [1.4-3.5]), congestive heart failure (3.1 [1.5-6.4]), and renal disease (2.6 [1.4-5.1]). We also observed an association with reduced COVID-19 mortality for diabetic patients for whom anticoagulants (0.11 [0.03-0.50]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.04-0.58]), penicillins (0.20 [0.06-0.63]), or biguanides (0.19 [0.05-0.70]) were administered within 21 days after their positive COVID-19 test with no evidence that they were on them before, and for hypertensive patients for whom anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02-0.35]), antiplatelet drugs (0.10 [0.02-0.59]), lipid-regulating drugs (0.15 [0.05-0.46]), penicillins (0.14 [0.05-0.45]), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (0.06 [0.01-0.53]) were administered within 21 days post-COVID-19-positive testing with no evidence that they were on them before. Moreover, long-term antidiabetic drugs were associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality in diabetic patients (0.26 [0.10-0.67]). Conclusions: We provided real-world evidence for observed associations between COVID-19 outcomes and a number of comorbidities and medications.

27,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using a vesicular stomatitis virus possessing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Tani, H.; Tan, L.; Kimura, M.; Yoshida, Y.; Yamada, H.; Fukushi, S.; Saijo, M.; Kawasuji, H.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Sakamaki, I.; Yamamoto, Y.; Morinaga, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1,2020-08-23,2020-08-23,,False
28,Systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics to model response to antiviral therapies,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 viral loads change rapidly following symptom onset so to assess antivirals it is important to understand the natural history and patient factors influencing this. We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to-date. Methods: This systematic review identified case reports, case series and clinical trial data from publications between 1/1/2020 and 31/5/2020 following PRISMA guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox-PH) of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modelling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time dependent drug effects. Findings: Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month-100 years) with 6316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modelling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, males and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, p<0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, p=0.015; AHR = 6.04, p = 0.006). Interpretation: Combination therapy including interferons should be further investigated. A NLME model for designing and analysing viral pharmacodynamics in trials has been established.","Gastine, S.; Pang, J.; Boshier, F. A. T.; Carter, S. J.; Lonsdale, D. O.; Cortina-Borja, M.; Hung, I.

29,Lipid droplets fuels SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammatory response,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that make use of the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic needs, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, as CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in human monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA. The pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.","Gomes Dias, S.

The Mother and Child Covid-19 study is a cohort recruiting about 1000 pregnant women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary results as recruitment is still open. Three sub-cohorts can be identified at recruitment. Sub-cohort 1 includes women giving birth between 23rd March and 25th May 2020; they have been retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their third trimester of pregnancy. Sub-cohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26th May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Sub-cohort 3 includes women in their 12th week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26th May 2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a naso-pharyngeal swab is also obtained from the child for RT-PCR analysis.

32,Impact of Duration of Cessation of Mass BCG Vaccination Programs on Covid -19 Mortality,"Back ground: BCG have heterogeneous immunity to certain pathogens other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis effect. At early times during COVID-19 pandemic heterogeneous immunity towards (SARS-CoV-2), was hypothesized and statistical correlation between of BCG vaccination practices and COVID-19 mortality variances among countries was statistically proved . These studies was criticized because of low evidence of such studies and possible confounding factors. For that reason this study was designed to look for impact of duration of cessation of BCG programs on Covid-19 mortality looking for the hypotheses by different design and looking forward to support previous studies. Methods: Total number of studied group is 14 countries which has stopped BCG vaccination programs. Through applying stem-leaf plot for exploring data screening behavior concerning Covid-19 Mortality for obsolescence duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs, as well as (nonlinear regression of compound model) for predicted shape behavior for that group. Results: Slope value shows highly significant effectiveness of obsolescence of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs on Covid -19 mortality at P-value<0.000. Obsolescence of duration of cessation of mass BCG vaccination programs has strongly negatively associated with Covid-19 mortality in countries which stopped BCG vaccination programs. Conclusion: The longer the cessation duration of BCG programs, the higher the Covid-19 mortality is, and vice versa.","Raham, T.

34,Poor knowledge of COVID-19 and unfavourable perception of the response to the pandemic by healthcare workers at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (West Region - Cameroon),"Background The World Health Organization has warned against a dramatic impact of COVID'19 in subSaharan Africa unless adequate response strategies are implemented. Whatever the strategy, the role of health care workers is pivotal. We undertook this study to assess knowledge of COVID'19 and perception of the response to the pandemic among the staff of a regional hospital in charge of COVID'19 patients in West Cameroon. Methods We used a convenience non probabilistic sampling method to carry out a survey with a self administered questionnaire from April 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020 at the Bafoussam Regional Hospital (BRH). All the staff was invited to participate. Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Epi Info version 7.1.5.2 software. Results Response rate was 76.1% (464/610). Mean age (SD) and average work experience (SD) were 35.0 (8.9) and 8.4 (7.4) years respectively. Sex ratio (M/F) was 101/356. Nursing and midwifery staff (56.8%) and in patients units (49.94%) were predominant. Knowledge on origin and transmission of SARS'CoV'2 was poor but knowledge of clinical signs and the role of laboratory tests were good. 53.2% of respondents said all therapeutic regimens are only supportive and only a third of them trusted drugs recommended by health authorities. For 36.9% of respondents, herbal remedies can prevent/cure COVID'19. 70% of staffs felt they were not knowledgeable enough to handle COVID'19 cases. 85.6% of respondents thought the BRH had insufficient resources to adequately respond to COVID'19 and 55.6% were dissatisfied with its response to the pandemic (weaknesses: medicines/technologies (74.5%), service delivery (28.1%), human resource (10.9%)). 68% of staff felt insufficiently protected on duty and 76.5% reported that the pandemic significantly reduced non-COVID-19 services. 85.5% said they complied with preventive measures while in the community. For 44% of respondents Cameroonian regulations on COVID'19 corpses should be made more culture sensitive. 51.2% of respondents were against vaccine trial in their community.

35,Dynamic causal modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Italy predicts possible scenarios for the second wave,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak. Mitigating virus spread could benefit from reliable predictive models that inform effective social and healthcare strategies. Crucially, the predictive validity of these models depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection that underwrite ongoing social and healthcare strategies. Formally, the problem at hand is not unlike the one faced in neuroscience when modelling brain dynamics in terms of the activity of a neural network: the recent COVID19 pandemic develops in epicenters (e.g. cities or regions) and diffuses through transmission channels (e.g., population fluxes). Indeed, the analytic framework known as ""Dynamic Causal Modeling"" (DCM) has recently been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding new light on the mechanisms and latent factors driving its evolution. The DCM approach rests on a time-series generative model that provides - through Bayesian model inversion and inference - estimates of the factors underlying the progression of the pandemic. We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions, which were the first areas in Europe to contend with the COVID-19 outbreak. We used official data on the number of daily confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths and performed tests. The model - parameterized using data from the first months of the pandemic phase - was able to accurately predict its subsequent evolution (including social mobility, as assessed through GPS monitoring, and seroprevalence, as assessed through serologic testing) and revealed the potential factors underlying regional heterogeneity. Importantly, the model predicts that a second wave could arise due to a loss of effective immunity after about 7 months. This second wave was predicted to be substantially worse if outbreaks are not promptly isolated and contained. In short, dynamic causal modelling appears to be a reliable tool to shape and predict the spread of the COVID-19, and to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently counteract its second wave, until effective vaccines become available.","Gandolfi, D.; Pagnoni, G.; Filippini, T.; Goffi, A.; Vinceti, M.; D'Angelo, E.

37,The active lung microbiota landscape of COVID-19 patients,"With the outbreak of COVID-19 causing by SARS-CoV-2, the interaction between the host and SARS-CoV-2 was widely studied.

Here, we analyzed the metatranscriptomic data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 19 COVID-19 patients and 23 healthy controls from 6 independent projects and detailed the active microbiota landscape in both healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 could deeply change the lung microbiota, evidenced by the -diversity, {beta}-diversity and species composition analysis based on bacterial microbiota and virome. Pathogens (such as Klebsiella oxytoca causing pneumonia as well), immunomodulatory probiotics (such as Lactic Acid Bacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a butyrate producer) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were enriched in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a severe microbiota dysbiosis. The significant correlation between Rothia mucilaginosa, TMV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed drastic inflammatory battles between the host, SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in the lungs. Notably, TMV only existed in the COVID-19 group, while Human respirovirus 3 only existed in the healthy group.

38,"CLINICAL COURSE, RISK FACTORS FOR TRANSFER TO ICU AND MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 AFFECTED BY ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE REFERRED TO A RESPIRATORY INTERMEDIATATE CARE UNIT.","Introduction There are no clear guidelines as yet for the selection of patients affected by COVID-19 who can be treated in intermediate RICU, neither shared criteria for their intubation and transfer in ICU. In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death. More studies need to be performed on COVID-19 patients, in the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","Buonamico, E.; Quaranta, V.

39,Pandemic Control in ECON-EPI Networks,"We develop an ECON-EPI network model to evaluate policies designed to improve health and economic outcomes during a pandemic. Relative to the standard epidemiological SIR set-up, we explicitly model social contacts among individuals and allow for heterogeneity in their number and stability. In addition, we embed the network in a structural economic model describing how contacts generate economic activity. We calibrate it to the New York metro area during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis and show three main results. First, the ECON-EPI network implies patterns of infections that better match the data compared to the standard SIR. The switching during the early phase of the pandemic from unstable to stable contacts is crucial for this result. Second, the model suggests the design of smart policies that reduce infections and at the same time boost economic activity. Third, the model shows that reopening sectors characterized by numerous and unstable contacts (such as large events or schools) too early leads to fast growth of infections.","Fogli, A.; Perri, F.; Ponder, M.; Azzimonti, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178087v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178087v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
40,Estimating healthcare resource needs for COVID-19 patients in Nigeria,"Background: Predicting potential healthcare resource use under different scenarios will help to prepare the healthcare system for a surge in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aim to predict the effect of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Nigeria. Method: We adopted a previously published discrete-time, individual-level, health-state transition model of symptomatic COVID-19 patients to the Nigerian healthcare system and COVID-19 epidemiology. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectories and acute care capacity. Primary outcomes included expected cumulative number of cases, days until depletion resources, and the number of deaths associated with resource constraints. Outcomes were predicted over a 60-day time horizon. Results: In our best-case epidemic trajectory, which implies successful implementation of public health measures to control COVID-19 spread, the current number of ventilator resources in Nigeria (conservative resources scenario), were expended within five days, and 901 patients may die while waiting for hospital resources in conservative resource scenario. In our expanded resource scenarios, ventilated ICU beds were depleted in all three epidemic trajectories within 60 days. Acute care resources were only sufficient in the best-case and intermediate epidemic scenarios, combined with a substantial increase in healthcare resources. Conclusion: Current hospital resources are inadequate to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Given Nigeria's limited resources, it is imperative to increase healthcare resources and maintain aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Ogunbameru, A.; Barrett, K.; Joda, A.; Khan, Y.

Here, we functionally define the role SARS-CoV-2 spike plays as a target of the human neutralizing antibody response. In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response.

42,Ferrets not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-exposure domestic setting,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic COVID-19. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein (Spike) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data support that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. This may be overcome in laboratory settings using concentrated viral inoculum, but the effects of ferret host-adaptations require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, K.; Hill, N. J.; Puryear, W.

43,Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD molecule with a T helper epitope as a built in adjuvant induces strong neutralization antibody response,"Without approved vaccines and specific treatment, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the world with above 20 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 700 thousand deaths until now. An efficacious and affordable vaccine is urgently needed. The Val308 - Gly548 of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 linked with Gln830 - Glu843 of Tetanus toxoid (TT peptide) (designated as S1-4) and without TT peptide (designated as S1-5), and prokaryotic expression, chromatography purification and the rational renaturation of the protein were performed. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 protein was evaluated by Western Blotting (WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency of it was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256. The candidate subunit vaccine molecule could stimulate strong humoral and Th1 and Th2-type cellular immune response in mice, giving us solid evidence that S1-4 protein could be a promising subunit vaccine candidate.","Su, Q.; Zou, Y.; Yi, Y.; Shen, L.; Ye, C.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, H.; Ke, H.; Song, J.; Hu, K.; Cheng, B.; Qiu, F.; Yu, P.; Zhou, W.; Cao, L.; Bi, S.; Wu, G.; Gao, G.

44,Functional and druggability analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome,"The infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide. As of today, more than 22 million people have been infected, with almost 800,000 fatalities. With the purpose of contributing to the development of effective therapeutics, this work provides an overview of the viral machinery and functional role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein, and a thorough analysis of the structure and druggability assessment of the viral proteome. All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures. Several potential allosteric or protein-protein interaction druggable sites on different viral targets were identified, knowledge that could be used to expand current drug discovery endeavors beyond the cysteine proteases and the polymerase complex. It is our hope that this study will support the efforts of the scientific community both in understanding the molecular determinants of this disease and in widening the repertoire of viral targets in the quest for repurposed or novel drugs against COVID-19.","Cavasotto, C.

45,How early into the outbreak can surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater tell us?,"There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of the outbreak within a community. Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases needed in a community to result in a positive detection of the virus in wastewaters. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.","Hong, P.; Rachmadi, A.

46,Development of antibodies to pan-coronavirus spike peptides in convalescent COVID-19 patients,"Coronaviruses are sharing several protein regions notable the spike protein (S) on their enveloped membrane surface, with the S1 subunit recognizing and binding to the cellular receptor, while the S2 subunit mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion. This similarity opens the question whether infection with one coronavirus will confer resistance to other coronaviruses? Investigating patient serum samples after SARS-CoV-2 infection in cross-reactivity studies of immunogenic peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we were able to detect the production of antibodies also recognizing MERS virus antigens. The cross-reactive peptide comes from the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS virus spike protein. Indeed, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein, previously proven to induce antibodies against MERS-CoV is sharing 74% homology with the corresponding sequence of SARS-CoV-19 virus. Sera samples of 47 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients, validated by RT-PCR-negative testes 30 days post-infection, and samples of 40 sera of control patients (not infected with SARS-CoV-2 previously) were used to establish eventual cross-bind reactivity with the MERS peptide antigen. Significantly stronger binding (p<0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to the control group. If used as an antigen, the peptide of the HR2 domain of the MERS spike protein allows discrimination between post-Covid populations from non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection has the ability to recognize and probably decrease infectiveness of MERS-CoV infections as well as other coronaviruses. The high homology of the spike protein domain suggests in addition that the opposite effect can also be true: coronaviral infections producing cross-reactive antibodies affective against SARS-CoV-19. The collected data prove in addition that despite the core HR2 region being hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections.","Rabets, A.; Bila, G.; Grytsko, R.; Samborsky, M.; Rebets, Y.; Vari, S.; Pagneux, Q.; Barras, A.; Boukherroub, R.; Szunerits, S.; Bilyy, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178566v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178566v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
47,High SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Children and Adults in the Austrian Ski Resort Ischgl,"Background: Early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. Methods: Between April 21 and 27, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study targeting the full population of Ischgl (n= 1867), of which 79% could be included (n=1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined seroprevalence on virus transmission. Findings: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% CI 39.8-44.7). Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI 21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2-47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356-0.682, p<0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded, corresponding to an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03-0.91). Only 8 (0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this study. Interpretation: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occured due to the dual impact from the non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) and a significant immunization of the Ischgl population.

48,Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients with Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Global Data,"Background Data on the prevalence of cancer in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients and the severe illness incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients with cancers remains unclear. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from database inception to July 15, 2020, for studies of patients with COVID-19 infection that had available comorbidity information on cancer. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients and the secondary endpoint was the outcomes of COVID-19-infected cancer patients with incidence of severe illness and death rate. We calculated the pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using a random-effects model, and performed meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on continent, country, age, sample size and study design. Findings A total of 107 eligible global studies were included in the systematic review. 90 studies with 94,845 COVID-19 patients in which 4,106 patients with cancer morbidity were included in the meta-analysis for prevalence of cancer morbidity among COVID-19 patients. 21 studies with 70,969 COVID-19 patients in which 3,351 patients with cancer morbidity who had severe illness or death during the studies. The overall prevalence of cancer among the COVID-19 patients was 0.07 (95% CI 0.05~0.09). The cancer prevalence in COVID-19 patients of Europe (0.22, 95% CI 0.17~0.28) was higher than that in Asia Pacific (0.04, 95% CI 0.03~0.06) and North America (0.05, 95% CI 0.04~0.06). The prevalence of COVID-19-infected cancer patients over 60 years old was 0.10 (95% CI 0.07~0.14), higher than that of patients equal and less than 60 years old (0.05, 95% CI 0.03~0.06). The pooled prevalence of severe illness among COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27~0.43) and the pooled death rate of COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14~0.18). The pooled incidence of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with cancers from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.38(0.24, 0.52), 0.36(0.17, 0.55), and 0.26(0.20, 0.31), respectively; and the pooled death rate from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.17(0.10, 0.24), 0.26(0.13, 0.39), and 0.19(0.13, 0.25), respectively. Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients, severe illness incidence and mortality rate. The prevalence of cancer varied significantly in geographical continents and ages. The COVID-19 patients with cancer were at-risk for severe illness and a high death rate. The European COVID-19 patients had the highest cancer prevalence among the three continents examined and were also the most likely to progress to severe illness and death. Although the Asia Pacific COVID-19 patients had the lowest cancer prevalence, their severe illness rate was similar to that of European.","Kong, X.; Qi, Y.; Huang, J.; Zhao, Y.; Zhan, Y.; Qin, X.; Qi, Z.; Atanda, A.; Zhang, L.; Wang, J.; Fang, Y.; Jia, P.; Golozar, A.; Zhang, L.; Jiang, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20177311v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20177311v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
49,"Longitudinal analysis of virus load, serum antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity in vitro in cases with less severe COVID-19","Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a highly variable clinical course, varying from barely discernible signs of disease, to moderate flu-like symptoms and, occasionally, with life-threatening pneumonia and/or cytokine storm. The relationship between the nasopharyngeal virus load, IgA and IgG antibodies to both the S1-RBD-protein and the N-protein as well the neutralizing activity (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of moderately afflicted COVID-19 patients has not been investigated longitudinally so far. Methods: Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed and validated for the longitudinal investigation in three patients of a family which underwent a mild course of COVID-19. Findings: We observed that the virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks, whereas serum antibodies showed a contrasting course. IgA levels to S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau approximately six weeks after disease onset. NAbs in serum reached a peak about four weeks after disease onset but dropped to a lower level about six weeks later. Interpretation: Our data establishes associations of virus neutralization and a serological immune response foremost against Sars-CoV-2 S1-RDB-protein in a longitudinal manner.","Flehmig, B.; Schindler, M.; Ruetalo, N.; Businger, R.; Bayer, M.; Haage, A.; Kirchner, T.; Klingel, K.; Normann, A.; Pridzun, L.; Tougianidou, D.; Ranke, M.

50,COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness in a United Kingdom Tertiary and Quaternary Children`s Hospital: Tales of the Unexpected,"Background: The paucity of data describing SARS-CoV-2 in the paediatric population necessitated a broad-arching approach to pandemic planning, with preparations put in place to manage a heterogeneous cohort. We describe a diverse group of SARS-CoV-2 positive paediatric patients treated at a large tertiary/quaternary children`s hospital in the United Kingdom and the adaptive coping strategies required. Methods: All paediatric patients with positive RT-PCR on a respiratory sample and/or serology for SARS-CoV-2 up to 19th May 2020 were included. Results: 57 children met the inclusion criteria. 70% were of non-Caucasian ethnicity with a median age of 9.3 years (IQR 5.16-13.48). Four distinct groups were identified: paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) (54%), primary respiratory (18%), incidental (7%), and non-specific febrile illnesses with or without extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction (21%). These groups presented in distinct chronological blocks as the pandemic unfolded. Discussion: The diverse range of presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population exemplified the importance of preparedness for the unknown in the midst of a novel infectious pandemic. Descriptions of paediatric patients during the initial phase of the pandemic from other parts of the globe and extrapolation from adult data did not serve as an accurate representation of paediatric COVID-19 in our centre. An adaptive, multidisciplinary approach was paramount. Expanded laboratory testing and incorporation of technology platforms to facilitate remote collaboration in response to strict infection control precautions were both indispensable. Lessons learned during the preparation process will be essential in planning for a potential second wave of SARS-CoV-2.","Alders, N.; Penner, J.; Grant, K.; Patterson, C.; Hassell, J.; MacDermott, N.; Pincott, S.; Bamford, A.; du Pre, P.; Johnson, M.; Moshal, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178541v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178541v1?rss=1,2020-08-22,2020-08-22,,True
51,Engagement and adherence trade-offs for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing,"Contact tracing is an important tool for allowing countries to ease lockdown policies introduced to combat SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked. However, policies such as legal enforcement of self-isolation can create trade-offs by dissuading individuals from self-reporting. We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritised. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme. We find that policies that increase the verage duration of self-isolation, or that increase the probability that people self-isolate at all, at the expense of reduced self-reporting rate, will not decrease the risk of a large outbreak and may increase the risk, depending on the strength of the trade-off. These results suggest that policies to increase self-isolation adherence should be implemented carefully. Policies that increase self-isolation adherence at the cost of self-reporting rates should be avoided.","Lucas, T. C. D.; Davis, E.

52,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Positive Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients; a multisource Electronic Healthcare Records Study from England,"Background: Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. However, there is limited information on management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant COVID19 infection. Objectives: This multisource national analysis of live data from England was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with ACS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: Multisource data from all acute NHS hospital in England was linked to study the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 ACS compared to non COVID-19 ACS patients. Hierarchical multilevel models were constructed to study the association between COVID19 ACS and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Results: Between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020, 517 (4.0%) were admitted with COVID- 19 ACS from a total of 12,958 ACS patients. COVID-19 ACS patients were generally older, BAME ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting characteristics compared to non-COVID-19 ACS patients. They were less likely to receive invasive coronary strategy in the form of coronary angiography (67.7% vs 81.0%), PCI (30.2% vs 53.9%), dual antiplatelet medication 76.3% vs 88.0%), and other important secondary medication. Patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (aOR 3.27 95%CI 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to non COVID-19 ACS group.

54,SARS-Cov-2 proliferation: an analytical aggregate-level model,"An intuitive mathematical model describing the virus proliferation is presented and its parameters estimated from time series of observed reported CoViD-19 cases in Germany. The model replicates the main essential characteristics of the proliferation in a stylized form, and thus can support the systematic reasoning about interventional measures (or their lifting) that were discussed during summer and which currently become relevant again in some countries. The model differs in form from elementary SIR models, but is contained in the general Kermack-McKendrick (1927) model. It is maintained that (compared to elementary SIR models) the model is more faithfully representing real proliferation at the instantaneous level, leading to overall more plausible association of model parameters to physical transmission and recovery parameters. The main policy-oriented results are that (1) mitigation measures imposed in March 2020 in Germany were absolutely necessary to avoid health care resource exhaustion, (2) fast response is key to containment in case of renewed outbreaks.

55,Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases.

56,Inhaled corticosteroids downregulate SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression in COPD: results from a RCT,"Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for the prevention of acute exacerbations in people with COPD, but their use is associated with increased risk of respiratory infections. The effects of ICS on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity are currently unknown. Objectives: To determine the effects of ICS treatment on the bronchial epithelial cell expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in volunteers with COPD. Methods: We performed a randomized, open-label, parallel treatment trial of 12 weeks treatment with ICS in combination with long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol/budesonide 12/400 g twice daily or salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 25/250 g twice daily), or treatment with LABA only (formoterol 12 g twice daily), in volunteers with mild to very severe COPD. We obtained bronchial epithelial cell samples via bronchoscopy before and after treatment, and determined transcriptome-wide gene expression by RNA sequencing. Main Results: 63 volunteers were randomized to receive treatment. Compared to formoterol alone, formoterol/budesonide treatment decreased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 and the host cell protease gene ADAM17. These genes were highly co-expressed with innate immune response genes, particularly those of the type I interferon and anti-viral response pathways, which also tended to decrease following ICS treatment. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that ICS affect the expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in COPD. Their relation to important anti-viral response genes may have critical implications for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity in this vulnerable population.","Milne, S.; Li, X.; Yang, C.

58,Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic β-CoVs,"The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.

SignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.","Pontes, C.; Ruiz-Serra, V.

59,Temporal landscape of mutation accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh: possible implications from the ongoing outbreak in Bangladesh,"Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population. Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","Saha, O.; Shatadru, R.

60,SARS-CoV-2 infects brain choroid plexus and disrupts the blood-CSF-barrier,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leads primarily to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal, particularly in at risk individuals. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","Pellegrini, L.; Albecka, A.; Mallery, D.

It is critical to understand virus propagation dynamics within the respiratory system because new insights will increase our understanding of virus pathogenesis and enable infection patterns to be more predictable in vivo, which will enhance targeting of vaccines and drug delivery. This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network. Using physiological data associated with the respiratory rate and virus load that is inhaled, the model can improve our understanding of the concentration and spatiotemporal dynamics of virus.","Vimalajeewa, D.; Balasubramaniam, S.; Berry, D.

62,Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","Lapointe, C. P.; Grosely, R.; Johnson, A. G.; Wang, J.; Fernandez, I.

63,Targeting pentose phosphate pathway for SARS-CoV-2 therapy,"It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","Bojkova, D.; Costa, R.; Bechtel, M.; Ciesek, S.; Michaelis, M.; Cinatl, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
64,"Astodrimer sodium, dendrimer antiviral, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, J.

To this end, our lab has adapted focus forming assays for SARS-CoV-2 using Vero CCL-81 cells, referred to in this text as Vero WHO. Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test. We have shown that this assay is a sensitive tool for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer in human, non-human primate, and mouse polyclonal sera following SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 140 nm. SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The peplomer density was measured using very thin sections and showed a difference between the two virus isolates. SARS-CoV displayed one-third more peplomers per segmental particle volume than SARS-CoV-2.

The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

72,A Human-Immune-System mouse model for COVID-19 research(DRAGA mouse: HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2Rγc KO.NOD),"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates, and there is a compelling need for effective vaccines and therapeutic agents to lessen the severity of COVID-19 disease. Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R{gamma}c KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, T.-D.; Vir, P.; Shashikumar, S.; Karim, A.

73,Mapping the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived peptidome presented by HLA class II on dendritic cells,"Understanding and eliciting protective immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an urgent priority. To facilitate these objectives, we have profiled the repertoire of human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II)-bound peptides presented by HLA-DR diverse monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region. Results from this study have application in vaccine design, and will aid analysis of CD4+ T cell responses in infected individuals and vaccine recipients.","Parker, R.; Partridge, T.; Wormald, C.; Kawahara, R.; Stalls, V.; Aggelakopoulou, M.; Parker, J.; Powell Doherty, R.; Ariosa-Morejon, Y.; Lee, E.; Saunders, K.; Haynes, B.

74,Development of a high-throughput homogeneous AlphaLISA drug screening assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is in urgent need of therapeutic options. High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gorshkov, K.; Chen, C. Z.; de la Torre, J.

75,Exploring G and C-quadruplex structures as potential targets against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.

76,Susceptibility of raccoon dogs for experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.

77,SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in lungs of African green monkeys,"Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for unraveling the viral and host factors that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes. Our dataset provides a detailed view of changes in host and virus replication dynamics over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.","Speranza, E.; Williamson, B.

78,What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents? Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify mutation signatures and classify SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","Nagpal, S.; Srivastava, D.; Mande, S.

79,A rapid and efficient screening system for neutralizing antibodies and its application for the discovery of potent neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD,"Neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been considered as promising therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathogens. After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2.

80,SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies provides insight into its genetic dynamics during infection,"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","Sun, F.; Wang, X.; Tan, S.; Dan, Y.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Xu, J.; Tan, Z.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Zhang, W.; Chen, Y.; Tan, W.; Deng, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
81,Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

82,SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c Is a Membrane-Associated Protein that Suppresses Antiviral Responses in Cells,"Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.

86,Erythroid precursors and progenitors suppress adaptive immunity and get invaded by SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2.

To address the urgent need for treatment options, we carried out a quantitative high-throughput screen using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic assay with a compound collection of 8,810 approved and investigational drugs, mechanism-based bioactive compounds, and natural products. Three hundred and nineteen compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were identified and confirmed, including 91 approved drug and 49 investigational drugs. Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported. Chlorprothixene, methotrimeprazine, and piperacetazine were the three most potent FDA approved drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These three compounds have not been previously reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, although their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus have been reported. These results demonstrate that this comprehensive data set of drug repurposing screen for SARS-CoV-2 is useful for drug repurposing efforts including design of new drug combinations for clinical trials.","Chen, C.

88,Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers,"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab)2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab)2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","Cunha, L.

89,A Lymph Node Targeted Amphiphile Vaccine Induces Potent Cellular and Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to public health, economic, and social consequences that mandate urgent development of effective vaccines to contain or eradicate infection. To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, M. P.; Seenappa, L.

90,Bacterial modification of the host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modulates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.

In this study we examine the impact of microbial modification of HS on viral attachment.

91,Generalized linear models provide a measure of virulence for specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains,"This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","Oulas, A.; Zanti, M.; Tomazou, M.; Zachariou, M.; Minadakis, G.; Bourdakou, M.

Although angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed by epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells as co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization. These results have imperative implications for our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and reveal an important target for novel prophylactic intervention.","Bermejo-Jambrina, M.; Eder, J.; Kaptein, T.

Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor.

95,Spike protein mutational landscape in India: Could Mullers ratchet be a future game-changer for COVID-19?,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

SignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, R.; Basak, K.; Ghosh, A.; Rajachandran, V.; Sureka, K.; Ganguly, D.; Chattopadhyay, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

Here we present for the first time that whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication. Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Fan, H.; Luo, Y.; Hong, B.; Wang, L.; Jin, X.; Chen, Y.; Hu, Y.; Li, T.; Zhuang, H.; Zhou, Y.-H.; Tong, Y.-G.; Xiang, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.254979v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False
97,IFITM proteins promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) restrict numerous viral pathogens and are thought to prevent infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues. Our finding that IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under conditions approximating the in vivo situation shows that they may promote viral invasion during COVID-19.
