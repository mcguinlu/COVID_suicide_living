0,Kinetics of viral clearance and antibody production across age groups in SARS-CoV-2 infected children,"Objectives: To improve understanding of transition from viral infection to viral clearance, and antibody response in pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study design: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13th, 2020 to June 21st, 2020 included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. Results: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and RT-PCR negativity from positivity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 to 15 years demonstrated a longer period of RT-PCR negativity from positivity, compared to patients aged 16 to 22 years (median=32 versus 18 days, p=0.015). Median time to seropositivity from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days while median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as equivalent to 160 titer) was 36 days. Conclusions: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. Whether this correlates with persistent infectivity is unknown. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that some patients may not mount significant immune responses to infection. It remains unknown if IgG antibody production correlates with immunity and how long measurable antibodies persist and protect against future infection.","Bahar, B.; Jacquot, C.; Mo, Y.

1,The Epidemiology Characteristics of Positive COVID-19 patients in a Caribbean Territory.,"Background: The purpose of the study is to determine the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a Caribbean Territory by the characterisation of patients in terms of, the numbers, socio demographics and associated co-morbidities. This comparison was done between local cases and imported cases. There have been no prior studies on COVID-19 in the Caribbean and as such this paper attempts to discuss the patterns associated with COVID-19 patients in the Caribbean. Methods: This study determined the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a Caribbean territory using retrospective data. Analysis was performed using Excel and SPSS v23. Results: The majority of patients were female (61.9%) vs male (38.0%). The majority of the population were between 45 -64 yrs (43.4%) followed by above 65 at 28.8%. Cough was the most common presenting complaint at 44.9%, with fever being second 37.1%. The majority of female participants had a travel history at 61.9%, while males were 38.0 %. The occurrence of cough was high among both local cases (46.4%) and imported cases (47.6%). Conclusions: These patterns can inform clinicians and other health care workers on the unique findings associated with COVID-19 positive patients especially those in the Caribbean region","Gopaul, C.

2,"A Long-Lasting Sanitizing Skin Protectant based on CAGE, a Choline and Geranic Acid Eutectic","The recent outbreak and rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and a massive public health crisis. COVID-19 has also had a severe impact on the quality of life and mental health. While different health authorities such as WHO and CDC are encouraging adoption of strategies including hand washing and use of facemasks to reduce the spread of the pathogens and infections, adoption of these approaches requires substantial commitment. Current hand sanitizers based on ethanol provide immediate protection, however, the protection rendered by such sanitizers is very short-lived due to their rapid evaporation. A long-lasting sanitizing skin protectant that can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and provide persistent efficacy over several hours will provide people the freedom to carry on with their activities without constant concerns about the cleanliness of their hands. Herein, we describe a skin protectant, IonLASTTM, based on an ionic liquid/deep eutectic solvent, formed by GRAS materials, choline and geranic acid (CAGE, CG-101), that provides protection for at least 4h after a single application. IonLASTTM was formulated as a gel that facilitates easy application on the skin. Tolerance of CG-101 was substantiated through a study in human volunteers. In vitro studies confirmed that IonLASTTM effectively inactivates a human coronavirus hCoV229E. A second human clinical study established that a single application of IonLASTTM imparts protection against microbes that lasts up to several hours.","Shevachman, M.; Mandal, A.; Mitragotri, S.; Joshi, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20161067v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20161067v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
3,The association between lockdown due to COVID-19 epidemic and searches for toothache using Google Trends in Iran,"Objective: To assess the association between the lockdowns due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT). Methods: We investigated GT online searches for the search term   within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of lockdown in Iran. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to identify whether there is a statistical difference for RSV scores between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water with linear regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: When comparing 2020 with previous four years, there is a statistically significant difference between RSVs of 2020 with all previous years combined and each of these years (P<0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B=-3.29, 95% CI: (-5.80, -0.78), P=0.012), fluoride concentration (B=-0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.03), P=0.017), and prevalence of daily smokers (B=0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), P=0.002) were significantly associated with RSVs. These covariates were not statistically significant for other years, except for Internet access in 2016 (B=-1.13, 95% CI: (-2.26, 0.00), P=0.050). Conclusion: The RSVs for toothache in 2020 have significantly increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns compared to the same period of the year in the past four years. knowing that this period mostly overlaps with the national holidays of Nowruz in Iran, reinforces the impacts of lockdowns on people CSB about toothache. In the subnational scale, the RSVs were significantly correlated with HDI, fluoride concentration, and number of daily smokers which emphasizes the role of socioeconomic factors in dental health and care-seeking behaviour.","Sofi-Mahmudi, A.; Shamsoddin, E.; Ghasemi, P.; Mehrabi Bahar, A.; Shaban Azad, M.; Sadeghi, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20160515v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.06.20160515v1?rss=1,2020-08-07,2020-08-07,,True
4,"How to handle the deceased body of COVID-19: an insight from Indonesian muslim burial handlers knowledge, perception, and practice","Introduction: Handling the remained body affected by COVID-19 in Indonesia is still an issue as it is done by community. Aim: This study aims to explore the handlers knowledge, perception, and practice in handling the remains. Method: This study elaborates qualitative design in exploring the handlers knowledge, perception, and practice in handling the remains dealing with universal precaution during the handling of the deceased body of COVID-19. The data is obtained through in-depth interview with guides. Result: The majority of participants were acknowledged that the universal precaution is a precautionary conduct which remains general and non-technical. Technicality on the universal precaution such as personal protective equipment and safety standards for infectious substance on the dead body are still incomprehensive. The perception of each handler of the body is still obscure. It was showed by cautious/apprehensive sense predominated the handlers in handling the dead body.

5,Clinical and intestinal histopathological findings in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 patients with hematochezia,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 in the form of anorexia,nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are usually preceeded by respiratory manifestations and are associated with a poor prognosis. Hematochezia is an uncommon clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease and we hypothesize that older patients with significant comorbidites (obesity and cardiovascular) and prolonged hospitalization are suspectible to ischemic injury to the bowel. We reviewed the clinical course, key laboratory data including acute phase reactants, drug/medication history in two elderly male patients admitted for COVID-19 respiratory failure. Both patients had a complicated clinical course and suffered from hematochezia and acute blood loss anemia requiring blood transfusion around day 40 of their hospitalization. Colonoscopic impressions were correlated with the histopathological findings in the colonic biopies and changes compatible with ischemia to nonspecific acute inflammation, edema and increased eosinophils in the lamina propria were noted.Both patients were on anticoagulants, multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents due to respiratory infections at the time of lower GI bleeding. Hematochezia resolved spontaneously with supportive care. Both patients eventually recovered and were discharged. Elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions are uniquely at risk for ischemic injury to the bowel. Hypoxic conditions due to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure, compounded by preexisting cardiovascular complications, and/or cytokine storm orchestrated by the viral infection leading to alteration in coagulation profile and/or drug/medication injury can be difficult to distinguish in these critically ill patients. Presentation of hematochezia may further increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients, and prompt consultation and management by gastroenterology is therefore warranted.","Cho, M.; Liu, W.; Balzora, S.; Suarez, Y.; Hoskoppal, D.; Theise, N.

6,Prediction of Covid-19 Infections Through December 2020 for 10 US States Using a Two Parameter Transmission Model Incorporating Outdoor Temperature and School Re-Opening Effects,"Covid-19 infection case predictions (total cases) are made for August through December 2020 for 10 US States (NY, WA, GA, IL, MN, FL, OH, MI, CA, and NC). A two-parameter model based on social distance index (SDI) and disease transmission efficiency (G) parameters is used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease spread. Current lack of coherent and coordinated US policy causes the US to follow a linear infection growth path with a limit cycle behavior that modulates the US between accelerating and decaying infection growth on either side of a linear growth path boundary. Four prediction cases are presented: 1) No school re-openings; fall season temperature effect 2) No school re-openings; no fall season temperature effect 3) School re-openings; fall season temperature effect 4) School re-openings; no fall season temperature effect Fall outdoor temperatures, in contrast to the 1918 pandemic, are predicted to be beneficial for dampening SARS-CoV-2 transmission in States as they pass through swing season temperature range of 70F to 50F. Physical re-opening of schools in September are predicted to accelerate infections. States with low current infectious case numbers (eg, NY) are predicted to be minimally impacted while States with high current infectious case numbers (eg, CA and FL) will be significantly impacted by school re-openings. Updated infection predictions will be posted monthly (Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec) with adjustments based on actual trends in SDI and G. Assessments related to outdoor temperature impact, school re-openings, and other public gathering re-openings will be discussed in updated reports.","Newell, T.

7,Characterization of Israeli COVID-19 Outbreak Drivers and Forecasting Using a Versatile Web App,"Background. No versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to fully analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The NMB-DASA web app presented here fills this gap. Methods. Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies a contact class of individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic classes and a parallel set of response class, subject to lower contact pathogen contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file containing incidence and mortality time series. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a subset of these can be fitted to the model using an MLE algorithm. The end of model-fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allows counterfactual and forecasted scenarios to be explored. Findings. We illustrate the app in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, which can be divided into four distinct phases: an initial outbreak; a social distancing, a social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. Our projections beyond the relaxation phase indicate that an 85% drop in social relaxation rates are needed just to stabilize the current incidence rate and that at least a 95% drop is needed to quell the outbreak. Interpretation. Our analysis uses only incidence and mortality rates. In the hands of policy makers and health officers, we believe our web app provides an invaluable tool for evaluating the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.","Getz, W.

8,"Groundbreaking predictions about COVID-19 pandemic duration, number of infected and dead: A novel mathematical approach never used in epidemiology","Hundreds of predictions about the duration of the pandemic and the number of infected and dead have been carried out using traditional epidemiological tools (i.e. SIR, SIRD models, etc.) or new procedures of big-data analysis. However, the extraordinary complexity of the disease and the lack of knowledge about the pandemic (i.e. R value, mortality rate, etc.) create uncertainty about the accuracy of these estimates. However, several elegant mathematical approaches, based on physics and probability principles, like the Delta-t argument, Lindy's Law or the Doomsday principle-Carter's catastrophe, which have been successfully applied by scientists to unravel complex phenomena characterized by their great uncertainty (i.e. Human race's longevity; How many more humans will be born before extinction) allow predicting parameters of the Covid-19 pandemic. These models predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will hit us until at least September-October 2021, but will likely last until January-September 2022, causing a minimum of 36,000,000 infected and most likely 60,000,000, as well as 1,400,000 dead at best and most likely 2,333,000.","Garcia Garcia de Alcaniz, J.; Lopez-Rodas, V.; Costas, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168781v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168781v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
9,Short-term change in air pollution following the COVID-19 state of emergency: A national analysis for the United States,"Lockdown measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic produced sudden social and economic changes. We examined the extent of air pollution reduction that was attained under these extreme circumstances, whether these reductions occurred everywhere in the US, and the local factors that drove them. Employing counterfactual time series analysis based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we found that these extreme lockdown measures led to a reduction in the weekly PM2.5 average by up to 3.4 micrograms per cubic meter and the weekly NO2 average by up to 11 ppb. These values represent a substantial fraction of the annual mean NAAQS values of 12 micrograms per cubic meter and 53 ppb, respectively. We found evidence of a statistically significant decline in NO2 concentrations following the state-level emergency declaration in almost all states. However, statistically significant declines in PM2.5 occurred mostly in the West Coast and the Northeast. Certain states experienced a decline in NO2 but an increase in PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that these two pollutants arise from dissimilar sources in these states. Finally, we found evidence that states with a higher percentage of mobile source emissions prior to the emergency measures experienced a greater decline in NO2 levels during the pandemic. Although the current social and economic restrictions are not sustainable, our results provide a benchmark to estimate the extent to which air pollution reductions can be achieved. We also identify factors that contributed to the magnitude of pollutant reductions, which can help guide future state-level policies to sustainably reduce air pollution.","Tyagi, P.; Braun, D.; Dominici, F.; Henneman, L.; Sabath, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20168237v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20168237v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
10,Safety of hot and cold site admissions within a high volume urology department in the United Kingdom at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Importance: Contracting COVID-19 peri-operatively has been associated with a mortality rate as high as 23%. Using hot and cold sites has led to a low rate of post-operative diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and allowed safe continuation of important emergency and cancer operations in our centre. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the safety of the continuation of surgical admissions and procedures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic using hot and cold surgical sites. The secondary objective is to determine risk factors of contracting COVID-19 to help guide further prevention. Setting: A single surgical department at a tertiary care referral centre in London, United Kingdom. Participants: All consecutive patients admitted under the care of the urology team over a 3-month period from 1st March to 31st May 2020 over both hot acute admission sites and cold elective sites were included. Exposures: COVID-19 was prevalent in the community over the three months of the study at the height of the pandemic. The majority of elective surgery was carried out in a cold site requiring patients to have a negative COVID-19 swab 72 hours prior to admission and to self-isolate for 14 days pre-operatively, whilst all acute admissions were admitted to the hot site. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 was detected in 1.6% of post-operative patients. There was 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Results: A total of 611 patients, 451 (73.8%) male and 160 (26.2%) female, with a median age of 57 (interquartile range 44-70) were admitted under the surgical team. Of these, 101 (16.5%) were admitted on the cold site and 510 (83.5%) on the hot site. Surgical procedures were performed in 495 patients of which 8 (1.6%) contracted COVID-19 post-operatively with 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 was detected in 20 (3.3%) patients with 2 (0.3%) deaths. On multivariate analysis, length of stay was associated with contracting COVID-19 in our cohort (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuation of surgical procedures using hot and cold sites throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was safe practice, although the risk of COVID-19 remained and is underlined by a post-operative mortality. Reducing length of stay may be able to reduce contraction of COVID-19.","Stroman, L.; Russell, B.; Kotecha, P.; Kantarzi, A.; Ribeiro, L.; Jackson, B.; Ismaylov, V.; Debo-Aina, A.

11,Performing Qualitative Mask Fit Testing without a Commercial Kit: Fit Testing Which can be Performed at Home and at Work,"Introduction: Qualitative fit testing is a popular method of ensuring the fit of sealing face masks such as N95 and FFP3 masks. Increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages in testing equipment and has forced many institutions to abandon fit testing. Three key materials are required for qualitative fit testing: the test solution, nebulizer, and testing hood. Accessible alternatives to the testing solution have been studied. This exploratory qualitative study evaluates alternatives to the nebulizer and hoods for performing qualitative fit testing. Methods: Four devices were trialled to replace the test kit nebulizer. Two enclosures were tested for their ability to replace the test hood. Three researchers evaluated promising replacements under multiple mask fit conditions to assess functionality and accuracy. Results: The aroma diffuser and smaller enclosures allowed participants to perform qualitative fit tests quickly and with high accuracy. Discussion & Conclusion: Aroma diffusers show significant promise in their ability to allow individuals to quickly, easily, and inexpensively perform qualitative fit testing. Our findings indicate that aroma diffusers and homemade testing hoods may allow for qualitative fit testing when conventional apparatus is unavailable. Additional research is needed to evaluate the safety and reliability of these devices.","O'Kelly, E.; Arora, A.; Pearson, C.; Ward, J.; Clarkson, P.

12,Measurement lessons of a repeated cross-sectional household food insecurity survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,"Objective To validate the telephone modality of the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA) included in three waves of a phone survey to estimate the monthly household food insecurity (HFI) prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Design We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of a cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children, and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of HFI with socioeconomic status and anxiety. Setting ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples and we used data from April (n=833), May (n=850), and June 2020 (n=1,674). Participants Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. Results ELCSA had adequate model fit and HFI was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security; decreasing stepwise from 38.9% in 2018 to 24.9% in June 2020 in households with children.

13,Inhomogeneous mixing and asynchronic transmission between local outbreaks account for the spread of COVID-19 epidemics,"The ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 originated in China has reinforced the need to develop epidemiological models capable of describing the progression of the disease to be of use in the formulation of mitigation policies. Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to show that the delay in the transmission of the spread between different subsets of the total population, can be incorporated into a SIR framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remains uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of the COVID-19 using real data from different countries with an emphasis in the case of Mexico and show that it describes correctly also the long-time dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak and considerably improves accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may probe be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of epidemics and thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","Mendoza, C.

14,Phylodynamics reveals the role of human travel and contact tracing in controlling COVID-19 in four island nations,"Most populated corners of the planet have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the progression of COVID-19 in four island nations that fared well over the first three months of the pandemic: New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan. Using Bayesian phylodynamic methods, we estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in the four islands as 1-1.4 during early stages of the pandemic, and show that it declined below 1 as human movement was restricted. Our reconstruction of COVID-19's phylogenetic history indicated that this disease was introduced many times into each island, and that introductions slowed down markedly when the borders closed. Finally, we found that New Zealand clusters identified via standard health surveillance largely agreed with those defined by genomic data. Our findings can assist public health decisions in countries with circulating SARS-CoV-2, and support efforts to mitigate any second waves or future epidemics.","Douglas, J.; Mendes, F.

16,Insights into the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: Lessons learned from a high-risk country,"Background South Asian countries including Bangladesh have been struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic despite imposing months of lockdown and other public health measures (as of June 30, 2020). In-depth epidemiological information from these countries is lacking. From the perspective of Bangladesh, this study aims to understand the epidemiological features and gaps in public health preparedness. Method This study used publicly available data (8 March-30 June 2020) from the respective health departments of Bangladesh and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre. Descriptive statistics was used to report the incidence, case fatality rates (CFR), and trend analysis. Spatial distribution maps were created using ArcGIS Desktop. Infection dynamics were analyzed via SIR models. Findings In 66 days of nationwide lockdown and other public health efforts, a total of 47,153 cases and 650 deaths were reported. However, the incidence was increased by around 50% within a week after relaxing the lockdown. Males were disproportionately affected in terms of infections (71%) and deaths (77%) than females. The CFR for males was higher than females (1.38% vs 1.01%). Over 50% of infected cases were reported among young adults (20-40-year age group). Geospatial analysis between 7 June 2020 and 20 June 2020 showed that the incidences increased 4 to 10-fold in 12 administrative districts while it decreased in the epicenter. As compared to the EU and USA, trends of the cumulative incidence were slower in South Asia with lower mortality. Conclusion Our findings on gaps in public health preparedness and epidemiological characteristics would contribute to facilitating better public health decisions for managing current and future pandemics like COVID-19 in the settings of developing countries.","Siam, M.

17,Discontinuity of the deadly infection rate for the COVID-19 pandemia due to lockdown measures,An asymmetric version of the classical Kermack-McKendrick description of an epidemic evolution is presented in terms of four independent parameters. This is enough to obtain an accurate description of the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemia in any country for the reported daily and total number of casualties due to the infection. The asymmetry accounts for lockdown effects introduced to reduce the impact of the epidemic outburst. A set of new variables allows for an analytic study of the evolution of the system before and after the lockdown measures are put in place. A continuous matching is possible for all variables in the system apart from the time dependence of the infection rate. An analytic expression is obtained for this discontinuity which is proposed as a good quantity to gauge the efficiency of the lockdown measures. A study of this variable for different countries is performed.,"Sabio Vera, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168880v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168880v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
18,COVID-19: Beliefs in misinformation in the Australian community,"Objectives: To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time. Study design: Prospective national longitudinal community online survey. Setting: Australian general public. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362 baseline/Wave 1; n=1882 Wave 2; n=1369 Wave 3). Main outcome measure: COVID-19 misinformation beliefs. Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated increased between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered up decreased (p<0.001). Greatest support from a list of Australian Government identified myths was for those regarding hot temperatures killing the virus (22%) and Ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 (13%). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater support for COVID-19 myths after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Conclusion: These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness. Stronger endorsement of misinformation was associated with male gender, younger age, lower education and language other than English spoken at home. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts. Public health authorities must urgently target groups identified in this study when countering misinformation and seek ways to enhance public trust of experts, governments, and institutions.","Pickles, K.; Cvejic, E.; Nickel, B.; Copp, T.; Bonner, C.; Leask, J.; Ayre, J.; Batcup, C.; Cornell, S.; Dakin, T.; Dodd, R.; Isautier, J.

19,Paediatric Attendances and Acuity in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Aim: To investigate the difference in both numbers and acuity of presentations to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the peak time period of the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design: This single centre retrospective observational study used routinely collected electronic health data to compare patient presentation characteristics between 21st March and 26th April 2020 compared to the equivalent time period in 2019. Results: There was a 90% decrease in attendances to PED, with a 10.23% reduction re-attendance rate. Children presenting were younger during the pandemic, with a median age difference of 2 years. They were more likely to present in an ambulance (9.63%), be admitted to hospital (5.75%) and be assigned the highest two Manchester triage categories (6.26%). There was a non-significant trend towards longer lengths of stay. The top 10 presenting complaints remained constant (although the order changed) between time periods. There was no difference in mortality or admission to PICU. Implications: Our data demonstrates that there has been a significant decrease in numbers of children seeking emergency department care. It suggests that presenting patients were proportionally sicker during the pandemic; however, we would argue that this is more in keeping with appropriate acuity for PED presentations, as there were no differences in PICU admission rate or mortality. We explore some of the possible reasons behind the decrease in presentations and the implications for service planning ahead of the winter months.","Rose, K.; Van-Zyl, K.; Cotton, R.; Wallace, S.; Cleugh, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168666v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168666v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True

21,Signatures and mechanisms of efficacious therapeutic ribonucleotides against SARS-CoV-2 revealed by analysis of its replicase using magnetic tweezers,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results from an infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the third coronavirus outbreak to plague humanity this century. Currently, the most efficacious therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection is the Remdesivir (RDV), an adenine-like ribonucleotide analogue that is very efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase. Understanding why RDV is so well incorporated will facilitate development of even more effective therapeutics. Here, we have applied a high-throughput, single-molecule, magnetic-tweezers platform to study thousands of cycles of nucleotide addition by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase in the absence and presence of RDV, a Favipiravir-related analog (T-1106), and the endogenously produced ddhCTP. Our data are consistent with two parallel catalytic pathways of the replicase: a high-fidelity catalytic (HFC) state and a low-fidelity catalytic (LFC) state, the latter allowing the slow incorporation of both cognate and non-cognate nucleotides. ddhCTP accesses HFC, T-1106 accesses LFC as a non-cognate nucleotide, while RDV efficiently accesses both LFC pathway. In contrast to previous reports, we provide unequivocal evidence against RDV functioning as a chain terminator. We show that RDV incorporation transiently stalls the replicase, only appearing as termination events when traditional, gel-based assays are used. The efficiency of ddhCTP utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase suggests suppression of its synthesis during infection, inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Use of this experimental paradigm will be essential to the development of therapeutic nucleotide analogs targeting polymerases.","Seifert, M.; Bera, S. C.; van Nies, P.; Kirchdoerfer, R.

22,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult,"Numerous studies covering some aspects of SARS-CoV-2 data analyses are being published on a daily basis, including a regularly updated phylogeny on nextstrain.org. Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising all virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be possible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes based on statistical criteria is also not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","Morel, B.; Barbera, P.; Czech, L.; Bettisworth, B.; Huebner, L.; Lutteropp, S.; Serdari, D.; Kostaki, E.-G.; Mamais, I.; Kozlov, A.; Pavlidis, P.

23,Predicted Cellular Immunity Population Coverage Gaps for SARS-CoV-2 Subunit Vaccines and their Augmentation by Compact Joint Sets,"Subunit vaccines induce immunity to a pathogen by presenting a component of the pathogen and thus inherently limit the representation of pathogen peptides for cellular immunity based memory. We find that SARS-CoV-2 subunit peptides may not be robustly displayed by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules in certain individuals. We introduce an augmentation strategy for subunit vaccines that adds a small number of peptides to a vaccine to improve the population coverage of pathogen peptide display. We augment a subunit vaccine by selecting additional pathogen peptides to maximize the total number of vaccine peptide hits against the distribution of MHC haplotypes in a population. For each subunit we design independent MHC class I and MHC class II peptide sets for augmentation, and alternatively design a combined set of peptides for MHC class I and class II display. We evaluate the population coverage of 9 different subunits of SARS-CoV-2, including 5 functional domains and 4 full proteins, and augment each of them to fill a predicted coverage gap. We predict that a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain subunit vaccine will have fewer than six peptide-HLA hits with [&le;] 50 nM binding affinity per individual in 51.31% (class I) and 32.99% (class II) of the population, and with augmentation, the uncovered population is predicted to be reduced to 0.54% (class I) and 1.46% (class II). We find that a joint set of pathogen peptides for MHC class I and class II display is predicted to produce a more compact vaccine design than using independent sets for MHC class I and class II. We provide an open source implementation of our design methods (OptiVax), vaccine evaluation tool (EvalVax), as well as the data used in our design efforts here: https://github.com/gifford-lab/optivax/tree/master/augmentation.","Liu, G.; Carter, B.; Gifford, D.

24,IFN signaling and neutrophil degranulation transcriptional signatures are induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity. Together, our transcriptomic studies have delineated disease pathways to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to facilitate the design of new therapeutics for COVID-19.","Rosa, B.

25,Computational Hot-Spot Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain / ACE2 Complex,"Infection and replication of SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) requires entry to the interior of host cells. In humans, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) between the SARS CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) and the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2, on the surface of cells in the lower respiratory tract, is an initial step in the entry pathway. Inhibition of the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 PPI is currently being evaluated as a target for therapeutic and/or prophylactic intervention. However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this complex. Employing multiple computational platforms, we predicted hot-spot residues in a positive control PPI (PMI / MDM2) and the CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. Computational alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to predict changes in Gibbs free energy that are associated with mutating residues at the positive control (PMI/MDM2) or SARS RBD/ACE2 binding interface to alanine. Additionally, we used the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver to calculate macromolecular electrostatic surfaces at the interface of the positive control PPI and SARS CoV-2 / ACE2 PPI. Collectively, this study illuminates predicted hot-spot residues, and clusters, at the SARS CoV-2 RBD / ACE2 binding interface, potentially guiding the development of reagents capable of disrupting this complex and halting COVID-19.","Rosario, P.

Most existing reports have used a convenience sample, which may bias their estimates. Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 based on a random sample of adults living in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020 and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies between June 10 and July 6, 2020. Participants: 505 respondents, aged [&ge;]18 years, residing in non-congregate settings who completed both the survey and the serology test. Main outcomes and measures: We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies among the overall population and across pre-specified subgroups. We also assessed the prevalence of symptomatic illness, risk factors for virus exposure, and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. Results: Of the 505 respondents (mean age 50 [{+/-}17] years; 54% women; 76% non-Hispanic White individuals) included, 32% reported having at least 1 symptom suggestive of COVID-19 since March 1, 2020. Overall, 18 respondents had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in the state-level weighted seroprevalence of 3.1 (90% CI 1.4-4.8). Individuals who were asymptomatic had significantly lower seroprevalence (0.6% [90% CI 0.0-1.5]) compared with the overall state estimate, while those who reported having had [&ge;]1 and [&ge;]2 symptoms had a seroprevalence of 8.0% (90% CI 3.1-12.9) and 13.0% (90% CI 3.5-22.5), respectively. All 9 of the respondents who reported previously having a positive coronavirus test were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies. Nearly two-third of respondents reported having avoided public places (74%) and small gatherings of family or friends (75%), and 97% reported wearing a mask outside their home, at least part of the time. Conclusions and relevance: These estimates indicate that most people in Connecticut do not have detectable levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

28,Structure of papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2 and its complexes with non-covalent inhibitors,"The number of new cases world-wide for the COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, while efforts to contain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is producing varied results in different countries. There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals: papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these, PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes with inhibitors, determined at 1.60-2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro, with the ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value for SARS-CoV-2.","Osipiuk, J.; Azizi, S.-A.; Dvorkin, S.; Endres, M.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Jones, K.

29,Peptide Antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),"The design of an immunogenic scaffold that serves a role in treating a pathogen, and can be rapidly and predictively modeled, has remained an elusive feat. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-BLOCK synthetic peptide scaffolds act as antidotes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated infection of human ACE2-expressing cells. Critically, SARS-BLOCK peptides are able to potently and competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2, the main cellular entry pathway for SARS-CoV-2, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In order to create this potential therapeutic antidote-vaccine, we designed, simulated, synthesized, modeled epitopes, predicted peptide folding, and characterized behavior of a novel set of synthetic peptides. The biomimetic technology is modeled off the receptor binding motif of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and modified to provide enhanced stability and folding versus the truncated wildtype sequence. These novel peptides attain single-micromolar binding affinities for ACE2 and a neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and demonstrate significant reduction of infection in nanomolar doses. We also demonstrate that soluble ACE2 abrogates binding of RBD to neutralizing antibodies, which we posit is an essential immune-evasive mechanism of the virus. SARS-BLOCK is designed to uncloak the viral ACE2 coating mechanism, while also binding to neutralizing antibodies with the intention of stimulating a specific neutralizing antibody response. Our peptide scaffolds demonstrate promise for future studies evaluating specificity and sensitivity of immune responses to our antidote-vaccine. In summary, SARS-BLOCK peptides are a promising COVID-19 antidote designed to combine the benefits of a therapeutic and vaccine, effectively creating a new generation of prophylactic and reactive antiviral therapeutics whereby immune responses can be enhanced rather than blunted.","Watson, A.; Ferreira, L.

30,An improved methodology for estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2,"Since the identification of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in December 2019, there have been more than 17 million cases of the disease in 216 countries worldwide. Comparisons of prevalence estimates between different communities can inform policy decisions regarding safe travel between countries, help to assess when to implement (or remove) disease control measures and identify the risk of over-burdening healthcare providers. Estimating the true prevalence can, however, be challenging because officially reported figures are likely to be significant underestimates of the true burden of COVID-19 within a community. Previous methods for estimating the prevalence fail to incorporate differences between populations (such as younger populations having higher rates of asymptomatic cases) and so comparisons between, for example, countries, can be misleading. Here, we present an improved methodology for estimating COVID-19 prevalence. We take the reported number of cases and deaths (together with population size) as raw prevalence for the population. We then apply an age-adjustment to this which allows the age-distribution of that population to influence the case-fatality rate and the proportion of asymptomatic cases. Finally, we calculate the likely underreporting factor for the population and use this to adjust our prevalence estimate further. We use our method to estimate the prevalence for 166 countries (or the states of the United States of America, hereafter referred to as US state) where sufficient data were available. Our estimates show that as of the 30th July 2020, the top three countries with the highest estimated prevalence are Brazil (1.26%, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37), Kyrgyzstan (1.10%, 95% CI: 0.82 - 1.19) and Suriname (0.58%, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.63). Brazil is predicted to have the largest proportion of all the current global cases (30.41%, 95%CI: 27.52 - 30.84), followed by the USA (14.52%, 95%CI: 14.26 - 16.34) and India (11.23%, 95%CI: 11.11 - 11.24). Amongst the US states, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Louisiana (1.07%, 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.12), Florida (0.90%, 95% CI: 0.86 - 0.94) and Mississippi (0.77%, 95% CI: 0.74 - 0.81) whereas amongst European countries, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Montenegro (0.47%, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.50), Kosovo (0.35%, 95% CI: 0.29 - 0.37) and Moldova (0.28%, 95% CI: 0.23 - 0.30). Our results suggest that Kyrgyzstan (0.04 tests per predicted case), Brazil (0.04 tests per predicted case) and Suriname (0.29 tests per predicted case) have the highest underreporting out of the countries in the top 25 prevalence. In comparison, Israel (34.19 tests per predicted case), Bahrain (19.82 per predicted case) and Palestine (9.81 tests per predicted case) have the least underreporting. The results of this study may be used to understand the risk between different geographical areas and highlight regions where the prevalence of COVID-19 is increasing most rapidly. The method described is quick and easy to implement. Prevalence estimates should be updated on a regular basis to allow for rapid fluctuations in disease patterns.","Patel, V.; McCarthy, C.; Taylor, R. A.; Moir, R.; Kelly, L. A.; Snary, E.

31,COVID-19 Test & Trace Success Determinants: Modeling On A Network,"What determines the success of a COVID-19 Test & Trace policy? We use an SEIR agent-based model on a graph, with realistic epidemiological parameters. Simulating variations in certain parameters of Testing & Tracing, we find that important determinants of successful containment are: (i) the time from symptom onset until a patient is self-isolated and tested, and (ii) the share of contacts of a positive patient who are successfully traced. Comparatively less important is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings. Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered, alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key determinant of Test & Trace success.","Reich, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168799v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168799v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
32,Analysis of SIR-Network Model on COVID-19 with respect to its impact on West Bengal in India,"The recent global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease has prompted many researchers to formulate lock-down and quarantine scenarios while the main concern of the researchers is to model the spread and the possible duration of the COVID-19 infections and also research on how long this is going to last. It seems that most of the researchers have recognized lock-down as one of the major impact factors in their models. As a result of this in the absence of lock-down the models formulated would not contribute much significant results. Hence, in this work we decide to formulate a mathematical model which would be able to predict the spread and also the possible duration of the pandemic, by considering both partial lock-down and the corresponding unlocking situations. Employing SIR-network models and taking the various districts of highly populated areas of West Bengal, India as the nodes or vertices we attempt to model the spread and duration of the pandemic during both partial lock-down and unlock phases but separately. We consider the populations where the locally present people and the people who have undergone migration of some shorts are well mixed together. In the network that we have provided the pointed edges refer to the migrating workers that is those that move away from their regular habitats in want of work. We use this research to study not only the trends that are associated with COVID-19 outbreaks, but also to study the impacts of the Government policies and the improvisation of medical facilities on this outbreak in West Bengal. At the end, we attempt to throw light upon the crisis that the economy of the state may have to go through separately on partial lock-down and unlocking scenarios.","Khatua, D.; Guha, D.; Kar, S.; De, A.; Samanta, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169037v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
33,Health systems trust in the time of Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: A qualitative exploration,"Background: Lack of trust hinders care seeking, and limits community support for contact tracing, care seeking, information and communication uptake, multisectoral or multi-stakeholder engagement, and community participation. We aimed at exploring how trust might be breached and what implications this may have in COVID-19 pandemic response by the Bangladesh health systems. Methods: We conducted this qualitative research during the pandemic, through seven online focus group discussions, with purposively selected mixed-gender groups of clinicians and non-clinicians (n=50). Data were analyzed through conventional content analysis method. Results: The common thread throughout the findings was the pervasive mistrust of the people in Bangladeshi health systems in its management of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the existing health systems weaknesses, few others became evident throughout the progression of the pandemic, namely, the lack of coordination challenges during the preparatory phase as well as the advanced stages of the pandemic. This; compounded by the health systems and political leadership failures, lead to opportunistic corruption and lack of regulations; leading to low quality, discriminatory, or no service at all. These have trust implications, manifested in health seeking from unqualified providers, non-adherence to health advice, tension between the service seekers and providers, disapproval of the governance mechanism, misuse of already scarce resources, disinterest in community participation, and eventually loss of life and economy. Conclusions: Health sector stewards should learn the lessons from other countries, ensure multisectoral engagement involving the community and political forces, and empower the public health experts to organize and consolidate a concerted health systems effort in gaining trust in the short run, and building a resilient and responsive health system in the long.","Joarder, T.; Bin Khaled, M.

35,The Trend of Neutralizing Antibody Response Against SARS-CoV-2 and the Cytokine/Chemokine Release in Patients with Differing Severities of COVID-19: All Individuals Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Obtained Neutralizing Antibody,"Background: COVID-19 patients show a wide clinical spectrum ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe and fatal disease, and older individuals are known to be affected more severely. Neutralizing antibody for viruses is critical for their elimination, and increased cytokine/chemokine levels are thought to be related to COVID-19 severity. However, the trend of the neutralizing antibody production and cytokine/chemokine levels during the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with differing levels of severity has not been established. Methods: We serially collected 45 blood samples from 12 patients with different levels of COVID-19 severity, and investigated the trend of neutralizing antibody production using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and cytokine/chemokine release in the patients' clinical courses. Results: All 12 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 had the neutralizing antibody against it, and the antibodies were induced at approx. 4-10 days after the patients' onsets. The antibodies in the critical and severe cases showed high neutralizing activity in all clinical courses. Most cytokine/chemokine levels were clearly high in the critical patients compared to those with milder symptoms. Conclusion: Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were induced at a high level in the severe COVID-19 patients, indicating that abundant virus replication occurred. Cytokines/chemokines were expressed more in the critical patients, indicating that high productions of cytokines/chemokines have roles in the disease severity. These results may indicate that plasma or neutralizing antibody therapy could be a first-line treatment for older patients to eliminate the virus, and corticosteroid therapy could be effective to suppress the cytokine storm after the viral genome's disappearance.","Tjan, L.

36,Estimation of Effective Reproduction Number for COVID-19 in Bangladesh and its districts,"Background Bangladesh is going through an unprecedented crisis since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number of COVID-19 swarmed in the scientific community and public media due to its simplicity in explaining an infectious disease dynamic. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 over time in Bangladesh and its districts using reported cases. Methods Adapted methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), which is a sequential Bayesian approach using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, have been used to estimate Rt. Findings As of July 21, the mean Rt is 1.32(0.98-1.70, 90% HDI), with a median of 1.16(0.99-1.34 90% HDI). The initial Rt of Bangladesh was 3, whereas the Rt on the day of imposing nation-wide lockdown was 1.47, at the end of lockdown phase 1 was 1.06, at the end of lockdown phase 2 was 1.33. Each phase of nation-wide lockdown has contributed to the decline of effective reproduction number (Rt) for Bangladesh by 28.44%, and 26.70%, respectively, implying moderate effectiveness of the epidemic response strategies. Interpretation and Conclusion The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. The Rt continued to fall below the threshold value one steadily from the beginning of July and sustained around 1. The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. As of July 21, the current estimate of Rt is 1.07(0.92-1.15: 90% HDI), meaning that an infected individual is spreading the virus to an average of one other, with 0.07 added chance of infecting a second individual. This whole research recommends two things- broader testing and careful calibration of measures to keep Rt a long way below the crucial threshold one.","Hridoy, A.-E. E.; Naim, M.; Alam, E.; Emon, N.

37,U.S. Field Hospitals: A Study on Public Health Emergency Response to COVID-19,"With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rapidly growing in the U.S., many states are experiencing a shortage of hospital-especially ICU-beds. In addition to discharging non-critical patients, expanding local hospitals' capacity as well as re-opening closed healthcare facilities, these states are actively building or converting public venues into field hospitals to fill the gap1. By studying these makeshift hospitals, we found that the states most severely impacted by the pandemic are fast at responding with the first wave of hospitals opening around the date of peak demand and the majority ready to use by the end of April. However, depending on the types of patients the field hospitals accept (COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19) and how they are incorporated to local healthcare system, these field hospitals have utilization rate ranging from 100% to 0%. The field hospitals acting as alternative site to treat non-COVID-19 patients typically had low utilization rate and often faced the risk of COVID-19 outbreak in the facility. As overflow facilities, the field hospitals providing intensive care were highly relied on by local healthcare systems whereas the field hospitals dedicated to patients with mild symptoms often found it hard to fill the beds due to a combination of factors such as strict regulation on transferring patients from local hospitals, complication of health insurance discouraging health-seeking behavior, and effective public health measure to ""flatten the curve"" so that the additional beds were no longer needed.","Yuan, L.; Sherryn, S.; Hu, P.; Chen, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169094v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20169094v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
38,Longitudinal analysis of clinical serology assay performance and neutralising antibody levels in COVID19 convalescents,"Abstract Objectives:To investigate longitudinal trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and the performance of serological assays in diagnosing prior infection and predicting serum neutralisation titres with time Design Retrospective longitudinal analysis of a COVID19 case cohort . Setting NHS outpatient clinics Participants Individuals with RT-PCR diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not require hospitalization Main outcome measures The sensitivity with which prior infection was detected and quantitative antibody titres were assessed using four SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms. Two platforms employed SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) based antigens and two employed nucleocapsid (N) based antigens. Serum neutralising antibody titres were measured using a validated pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay. The ability of the serological assays to predict neutralisation titres at various times after PCR diagnosis was assessed. Results The three of the four serological assays had sensitivities of 95 to100% at 21-40 days post PCR-diagnosis, while a fourth assay had a lower sensitivity of 85%. The relative sensitivities of the assays changed with time and the sensitivity of one assay that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 85% at 61-80 post PCR diagnosis, and to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. Median antibody titres decreased in one serologic assay but were maintained over the observation period in other assays. The trajectories of median antibody titres measured in serologic assays over this time period were not dependent on whether the SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins were used as antigen source. A broad range of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres were evident in individual sera, that decreased over time in the majority of participants; the median neutralisation titre in the cohort decreased by 45% over 4 weeks. Each of the serological assays gave quantitative measurements of antibody titres that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation titres, but, the S-based serological assay measurements better predicted serum neutralisation potency. The strength of correlation between serologic assay results and neutralisation titres deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralisation titres in individual participants were not well predicted by changes in antibody titres measured using serologic assays. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays differed in their comparative diagnostic performance over time. Different assays are more or less well suited for surveillance of populations for prior infection versus prediction of serum neutralisation potency. Continued monitoring of declining neutralisation titres during extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Muecksch, F.; Wise, H.; Batchelor, B.; Squires, M.; Semple, E.; Richardson, C.; McGuire, J.; Cleary, S.; Furrie, E.; Greig, N.; Hay, G.; Templeton, K.; Lorenzi, J.

39,Inflammasome activation in COVID-19 patients,"Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by a strong inflammatory process that may ultimately lead to organ failure and patient death. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform that promotes inflammation via cleavage and activation of key inflammatory molecules including active caspase-1 (Casp1p20), IL-1{beta} and IL-18. Although the participation of the inflammasome in COVID-19 has been highly speculated, the inflammasome activation and participation in the outcome of the disease is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and it is active in COVID-19, influencing the clinical outcome of the disease. Studying moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, we found active NLRP3 inflammasome in PBMCs and tissues of post-mortem patients upon autopsy. Inflammasome-derived products such as Casp1p20 and IL-18 in the sera correlated with the markers of COVID-19 severity, including IL-6 and LDH. Moreover, higher levels of IL-18 and Casp1p20 are associated with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. Our results suggest that the inflammasome is key in the pathophysiology of the disease, indicating this platform as a marker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Rodrigues, T.

We present the Day 35 primary analysis of our trial of NVX-CoV2373 with or without the saponin-based Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adults. Methods This is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial in 131 healthy adults. Trial vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart. Primary outcomes were reactogenicity, safety labs, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-spike protein response. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, wild-type virus neutralizing antibody, and T-cell responses. Results Participants received NVX-CoV2373 with or without Matrix-M1 (n=106) or placebo (n=25). There were no serious adverse events. Reactogenicity was mainly mild in severity and of short duration (mean [&ge;] 2 days), with second vaccinations inducing greater local and systemic reactogenicity. The adjuvant significantly enhanced immune responses and was antigen dose-sparing, and the two-dose 5g NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 vaccine induced mean anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody responses that exceeded the mean responses in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients with clinically significant illnesses. The vaccine also induced antigen-specific T cells with a largely T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype. Conclusions NVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1 was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses (IgG and neutralization) four-fold higher than the mean observed in COVID-19 convalescent serum from participants with clinical symptoms requiring medical care and induced CD4+ T-cell responses biased toward a Th1 phenotype.

42,Transient dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 as England exited national lockdown,"Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a detailed understanding of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population. Case-based surveillance is necessarily biased towards symptomatic individuals and sensitive to varying patterns of reporting in space and time. The real-time assessment of community transmission antigen study (REACT-1) is designed to overcome these limitations by obtaining prevalence data based on a nose and throat swab RT-PCR test among a representative community-based sample in England, including asymptomatic individuals. Here, we describe results comparing rounds 1 and 2 carried out during May and mid June / early July 2020 respectively across 315 lower tier local authority areas. In round 1 we found 159 positive samples from 120,620 tested swabs while round 2 there were 123 positive samples from 159,199 tested swabs, indicating a downwards trend in prevalence from 0.13% (95% CI, 0.11%, 0.15%) to 0.077% (0.065%, 0.092%), a halving time of 38 (28, 58) days, and an R of 0.89 (0.86, 0.93). The proportion of swab-positive participants who were asymptomatic at the time of sampling increased from 69% (61%, 76%) in round 1 to 81% (73%, 87%) in round 2. Although health care and care home workers were infected far more frequently than other workers in round 1, the odds were markedly reduced in round 2. Age patterns of infection changed between rounds, with a reduction by a factor of five in prevalence in 18 to 24 year olds. Our data were suggestive of increased risk of infection in Black and Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicities. Using regional and detailed case location data, we detected increased infection intensity in and near London. Under multiple sensitivity analyses, our results were robust to the possibility of false positives. At the end of the initial lockdown in England, we found continued decline in prevalence and a shift in the pattern of infection by age and occupation. Community-based sampling, including asymptomatic individuals, is necessary to fully understand the nature of ongoing transmission.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K. E. C.; Eales, O.; Walters, C.

43,Extended lifetime of respiratory droplets in a turbulent vapour puff and its implications on airborne disease transmission,"To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it is key to slow down the spreading of the life-threatening coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This spreading mainly occurs through virus-laden droplets expelled at speaking, screaming, shouting, singing, coughing, sneezing, or even breathing [1-7]. To reduce infections through such respiratory droplets, authorities all over the world have introduced the so-called ""2-meter distance rule"" or ""6-foot rule"". However, there is increasing empirical evidence, e.g. through the analysis of super-spreading events [6, 8-11], that airborne transmission of the coronavirus over much larger distances plays a major role [1-3, 7, 12-15], with tremendous implications for the risk assessment of coronavirus transmission. It is key to better and fundamentally understand the environmental ambient conditions under which airborne transmission of the coronavirus is likely to occur, in order to be able to control and adapt them. Here we employ direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory aerosol in a turbulent jet of the respiratory event within a Lagrangian-Eulerian approach [16-18] with 5000 droplets, coupled to the ambient velocity, temperature, and humidity fields to allow for exchange of mass and heat [19] and to realistically account for the droplet evaporation under different ambient conditions. We found that for an ambient relative humidity of 50% the lifetime of the smallest droplets of our study with initial diameter of 10 m gets extended by a factor of more than 30 as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture of Wells [20, 21], due to collective effects during droplet evaporation and the role of the respiratory humidity [22], while the larger droplets basically behave ballistically. With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to 150 times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than two meters advection range of the respiratory droplets within one second. Smaller droplets live even longer and travel further. Our results may explain why COVID-19 superspreading events can occur for large ambient relative humidity such as in cooled-down meat-processing plants [10] or in pubs with poor ventilation.

44,Social Behaviors Associated with a Positive COVID-19 Test Result,"Objective: To compare behaviors of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 relative to non-infected individuals. Methods: We sent COVID positive cases and age/gender matched controls a survey regarding their social behaviors via MyChart (online patient portal). We called cases if they did not complete the electronic survey within two days. Data was collected from May-June 2020. Survey responses for cases without a close contact and controls were compared using Pearson chi-square or Fishers Exact tests as appropriate. Results: A total of 339 participants completed the survey (113 cases, 226 controls); 45 (40%) cases had known contact with COVID-19. Cases were more likely to have recently traveled (4% vs. 0%, p=0.01) or to work outside the home (40% vs. 25%, p=0.02). There was no difference in the rates of attending private or public gatherings, mask/glove use, hand-washing, cleaning surfaces and cleaning mail/groceries between cases and controls. Conclusions: Sixty percent of cases had no known contact with COVID-19, indicating ongoing community transmission and underlining the importance of contact tracing. The greater percentage of cases who work outside the home provides further evidence for social distancing.","Speaker, S.; Doherty, C. M.; Pfoh, E.

45,Features and Functions of Systemic and Mucosal Humoral Immunity Among SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Individuals,"Understanding humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection will play a critical role in the development of vaccines and antibody-based interventions. We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying disease severity. Robust antibody responses to diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens and evidence of elevated responses to endemic CoV were observed among convalescent donors. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG responses were often negatively correlated, particularly in mucosal samples, suggesting subject-intrinsic biases in isotype switching. Assessment of antibody-mediated effector functions revealed an inverse correlation between systemic and mucosal neutralization activity and site-dependent differences in the isotype of neutralizing antibodies. Serum neutralization correlated with systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. These findings begin to map how diverse Ab characteristics relate to Ab functions and outcomes of infection, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.","Butler, S.

46,Serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 by rapid IgM/IgG antibody test,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a global health- and economic crisis. Lifting confinement restriction and resuming to normality depends greatly on COVID-19 immunity screening. Detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 by serological methods is important to diagnose a current or resolved infection. In this study, we applied a rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody test and performed serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. In PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n=45), the total antibody detection rate is 92% in hospitalized patients and 79% in non-hospitalized patients. We also studied antibody response in relation to time after symptom onset and disease severity, and observed an increase in antibody reactivity and distinct distribution patterns of IgM and IgG following disease progression. The total IgM and IgG detection is 63% in patients with < 2 weeks from disease onset; 85% in non-hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration; and 91% in hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration. We also compared different blood sample types and suggest a potentially higher sensitivity by serum/plasma comparing with whole blood measurement. To study the specificity of the test, we used 69 sera/plasma samples collected between 2016-2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and obtained a test specificity of 97%. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive validation of the rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG serology test, and mapped antibody detection patterns in association with disease progress and hospitalization. Our study supports that the rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG test may be applied to assess the COVID-19 status both at the individual and at a population level.","De Marinis, Y.; Sunnerhagen, T.; Bompada, P.; Blackberg, A.; Yang, R.; Svensson, J.; Ekstrom, O.; Eriksson, K.-F.; Hansson, O.; Groop, L.; Goncalves, I.; Rasmussen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168815v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168815v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
47,Genomic epidemiology reveals transmission patterns and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Aotearoa New Zealand,"New Zealand, a geographically remote Pacific island with easily sealable borders, implemented a nation-wide lockdown of all non-essential services to curb the spread of COVID-19. New Zealand has now effectively eliminated the virus, with low numbers of new cases limited to new arrivals in managed quarantine facilities at the border. Here, we generated 649 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from infected patients in New Zealand with samples collected between 26 February and 22 May 2020, representing 56% of all confirmed cases in this time period. Despite its remoteness, the viruses imported into New Zealand represented nearly all of the genomic diversity sequenced from the global virus population. The proportion of D614G variants in the virus spike protein increased over time due to an increase in their importation frequency, rather than selection within New Zealand. These data also helped to quantify the effectiveness of public health interventions. For example, the effective reproductive number, Re, of New Zealand's largest cluster decreased from 7 to 0.2 within the first week of lockdown. Similarly, only 19% of virus introductions into New Zealand resulted in a transmission lineage of more than one additional case. Most of the cases that resulted in a transmission lineage originated from North America, rather than from Asia where the virus first emerged or from the nearest geographical neighbour, Australia. Genomic data also helped link more infections to a major transmission cluster than through epidemiological data alone, providing probable sources of infections for cases in which the source was unclear. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of genomic pathogen surveillance to inform public health and disease mitigation.","Geoghegan, J.

48,"Rapid, reliable, and cheap point-of-care bulk testing for SARS-CoV-2 by combining hybridization capture with improved colorimetric LAMP (Cap-iLAMP)","Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have spurred the need for reliable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods which can easily be applied to large numbers of people. However, current standard protocols for the detection of viral nucleic acids while sensitive, require a high level of automation, sophisticated laboratory equipment and trained personnel to achieve throughputs that allow whole communities to be tested on a regular basis. Here we present Cap-iLAMP (capture and improved loop-mediated isothermal amplification). This method combines a hybridization capture-based RNA extraction of non-invasive gargle lavage samples to concentrate samples and remove inhibitors with an improved colorimetric RT-LAMP assay and smartphone-based color scoring. Cap-iLAMP is compatible with point-of-care testing and enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in less than one hour. In contrast to direct addition of the sample to improved LAMP (iLAMP), Cap-iLAMP does not result in false positives and single infected samples can be detected in a pool among 25 uninfected samples, thus reducing the technical cost per test to ~1 Euro per individual.","Bokelmann, L.; Nickel, O.; Maricic, T.; Paabo, S.; Meyer, M.; Borte, S.; Riesenberg, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20168617v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.20168617v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
49,An Examination of School Reopening Strategies during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to the closure of nearly all K-12 schools in the United States of America in March 2020. Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials also understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases must be in place to allow children to safely return to school. Furthermore, the consequences of reclosing recently reopened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately the educational experience in children. Using a stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore the influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation (such as the use of masks, desk shields, frequent surface cleaning, or outdoor instruction), and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. Our model predicts that a combination of all three approaches will substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The model also shows that reduction of class density and the implementation of rapid viral testing, even with imperfect detection, have greater impact than moderate measures for transmission mitigation.","Landeros, A.; Ji, X.; Lange, K.

50,Development of mass spectrometry-based targeted assay for direct detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from clinical specimens,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic testing. Several types of diagnostics including RT-PCR-based assays, antigen detection by lateral flow assays and antibody-based assays have been developed and deployed in a short time. However, many of these assays are lacking in sensitivity and/or specificity. Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification followed by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted assay capable of detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was created using fragment ion intensities in the PRM data. This resulted in 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity with RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that direct detection of infectious agents from clinical samples by mass spectrometry-based assays have potential to be deployed as diagnostic assays in clinical laboratories.","Renuse, S.; Vanderboom, P.

51,Swab-Seq: A high-throughput platform for massively scaled up SARS-CoV-2 testing,"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is due to the high rates of transmission by individuals who are asymptomatic at the time of transmission. Frequent, widespread testing of the asymptomatic population for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to suppress viral transmission and is a key element in safely reopening society. Despite increases in testing capacity, multiple challenges remain in deploying traditional reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) tests at the scale required for population screening of asymptomatic individuals. We have developed SwabSeq, a high-throughput testing platform for SARS-CoV-2 that uses next-generation sequencing as a readout. SwabSeq employs sample-specific molecular barcodes to enable thousands of samples to be combined and simultaneously analyzed for the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 in a single run. Importantly, SwabSeq incorporates an in vitro RNA standard that mimics the viral amplicon, but can be distinguished by sequencing. This standard allows for end-point rather than quantitative PCR, improves quantitation, reduces requirements for automation and sample-to-sample normalization, enables purification-free detection, and gives better ability to call true negatives. We show that SwabSeq can test nasal and oral specimens for SARS-CoV-2 with or without RNA extraction while maintaining analytical sensitivity better than or comparable to that of fluorescence-based RT-qPCR tests. SwabSeq is simple, sensitive, flexible, rapidly scalable, inexpensive enough to test widely and frequently, and can provide a turn around time of 12 to 24 hours.","Bloom, J. S.; Jones, E.

52,Clinical Mortality Review in a Large COVID-19 Cohort,"Background: Northwell Health (Northwell), an integrated health system in New York, treated more than 15000 inpatients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the US epicenter of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We describe the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 mortalities, observation of frequent rapid response teams (RRT)/cardiac arrest (CA) calls for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that contributed to RRT/CA calls. Methods: A team of registered nurses reviewed medical records of inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before or on admission and died between March 13 (first Northwell inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020 at 15 Northwell hospitals. Findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed. Findings: Of 2634 COVID-19 mortalities, 56.1% had oxygen saturation levels greater than or equal to 90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was called on 42.2% of patients at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent oxygen saturation levels for 76.6% of non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time RRT/CA was called, 43.1% had an oxygen saturation less than 80%. Interpretation: This study represents one of the largest cohorts of reviewed mortalities that also captures data in non-structured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care, despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of non-ICU patients. Patients admitted to a non-ICU level of care suffer rapid clinical deterioration, often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants further study.","Jarrett, M. P.; Schultz, S. F.; Lyall, J.

53,"Epidemiology of Reopening in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, Europe and Asia","Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 has become a global healthcare and economic crisis. The United States (US) and Europe exhibited wide impacts from the virus with more than six million cases by the time of our analysis. To inhibit spread, stay-at-home orders and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were instituted. Beginning late April 2020, some US states, European, and Asian countries lifted restrictions and started the reopening phases. In this study, the changes of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were analyzed after reopening for 11 countries and 40 US states using an interrupted time series analysis. Additionally, the distribution of these categories was further analyzed by age due to the known increased risk in elderly patients. Reopening had varied effects on COVID-19 cases depending on the region. Recent increases in cases did not fully translate into increased deaths. Eight countries had increased cases after reopening while only two countries showed the same trend in deaths. In the US, 30 states had observed increases in cases while only seven observed increased deaths. In addition, we found that states with later reopening dates were more likely to have significant decreases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, age distributions through time were analyzed in relation to COVID-19 in the US. Younger age groups typically had an increased share of cases after reopening.","Zhang, W.; Oltean, A.; Nichols, S.; Odeh, F.; Zhong, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168757v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168757v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
54,Rapid systematic review of the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing on saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swabs,"ABSTRACT Background: Nasopharyngeal sampling has been the standard collection method for COVID-19 testing. Due to its invasive nature and risk of contamination for health care workers who collect the sample, non-invasive and safe sampling methods like saliva, can be used alternatively. Methods: A rapid systematic search was performed in PubMed and medRxiv, with the last retrieval on June 6th, 2020. Studies were included if they compared saliva with nasopharyngeal sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the same RT-qPCR applied on both types of samples. The primary outcome of interest was the relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples (used as the comparator test). A secondary outcome was the proportion of nasopharyngeal-positive patients that tested also positive on a saliva sample. Results: Eight studies were included comprising 1070 saliva-nasopharyngeal sample pairs allowing assessment of the first outcome. The relative sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on saliva versus nasopharyngeal samples was 0.97 (95% CI=0.92-1.02). The second outcome incorporated patient data (n=257) from four other studies (n=97 patients) pooled with four studies from the first outcome (n=160 patients). This resulted in a pooled proportion of nasopharyngeal positive cases that was also positive on saliva of 86% (95% CI=77-93%). Discussion: Saliva could potentially be considered as an alternative sampling method when compared to nasopharyngeal swabs. However, studies included in this review often were small and involved inclusion of subjects with insufficient information on clinical covariates. Most studies included patients who were symptomatic (78%, 911/1167). Therefore, additional and larger studies should be performed to verify the relative performance of saliva in the context of screening of asymptomatic populations and contact-tracing.","Peeters, E.; Kaur Dhillon Ajit Singh, S.; Vandesompele, J.; Mestdagh, P.; Hutse, V.; Arbyn, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.20168716v1?rss=1,2020-08-06,2020-08-06,,True
55,Alveolitis in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is driven by self-sustaining circuits between infected alveolar macrophages and T cells,"Some patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop severe pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.","Grant, R.

56,Host metabolic reprogramming in response to SARS-Cov-2 infection,"Understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is important for developing effective treatment strategies. Viruses hijack the host metabolism to redirect the resources for their replication and survival. How SARS-CoV-2 influences the host metabolism is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed transcriptomic data obtained from different human respiratory cell lines and patient samples (Swab, PBMC, lung biopsy, BALF) to understand the metabolic alterations in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, the expression pattern of metabolic genes in the human genome-scale metabolic network model Recon3D was explored. We identified metabolic genes and pathways and reporter metabolites under each SARS-CoV-2-infected condition and compared them to identify common and unique changes in the metabolism. Our analysis revealed host-dependent dysregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism. We observed different metabolic changes that are pro- and antiviral in nature. We generated hypotheses on how antiviral metabolism can be targeted/enhanced for reducing viral titers. These warrant further exploration with more samples and in vitro studies to test predictions.","Moolamalla, S. T. R.; Chauhan, R.; Priyakumar, U. D.; Vinod, P.

57,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant genomes,"Viral recombination has the potential to bring about viral genotypes with modified phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among Betacoronaviruses is well documented, SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in humans for approximately 8 months and thus has had a relatively short window of opportunity for the occurrence of recombination. The ability to detect recombination has further been limited by the relatively low levels of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, two studies have reported recombinants among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we first revisit these findings with a new analysis approach, arguing that neither presents a clear case of within-SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Applying this same approach to available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we then identify five recombinant genomes. Each of these genomes contain phylogenetic markers of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 clades. Further, the predicted parent clades of these recombinant genomes were, with one exception, documented to be co-circulating in the country of infection in the two weeks prior to the sample being collected. Our results indicate that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 strains is occurring, but is either not widespread or often remains undetectable given current levels of viral genetic diversity. Efforts to monitor the emergence of new recombinant genomes should therefore be sustained.","VanInsberghe, D.; Neish, A. S.; Lowen, A.

58,Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2-related proteases and its metabolite GBPA exerts antiviral activity,"Antiviral therapy is urgently needed to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant.

59,Rapid GMP-compliant expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from convalescent donors for use as an allogeneic cell therapy for COVID-19,"COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by dysregulation of effector T cells and accumulation of exhausted T cells. T cell responses to viruses can be corrected by adoptive cellular therapy using donor-derived virus-specific T cells. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2-exposed blood donations contain CD4 and CD8 memory T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens. These peptides can be used to isolate virus-specific T cells in a GMP-compliant process. These T cells can be rapidly expanded using GMP-compliant reagents for use as a therapeutic product. Memory and effector phenotypes are present in the selected virus-specific T cells, but our method rapidly expands the desirable central memory phenotype. A manufacturing yield ranging from 1010 to 1011 T cells can be obtained within 21 days culture. Thus, multiple therapeutic doses of virus-specific T cells can be rapidly generated from convalescent donors for treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Cooper, R. S.; Fraser, A.

60,Evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and its consequences,"The emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has created a global confusing pandemic health crisis that warrants an accurate and detailed characterization of the rapidly evolving viral genome for understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis and containment. We explored 61,485 sequences of the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in RT-PCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3'-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions were revealed, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequences of high-frequency mutations ([&ge;] 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) coevolving mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing nonsynonymous evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M. S.; Islam, M. R.; Ul Alam, A. S.

63,Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in care home staff and residents in English care homes: A service evaluation,"Background COVID-19 has especially affected care home residents. Aim To evaluate a nurse-led Enhanced Care Home Team (ECHT) enhanced SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy. Design and setting Service evaluation in care homes in Norfolk UK. Method Residents and staff received nose and throat swab tests (7 April to 29 June 2020). Resident test results were linked with symptoms on days 0-14 after test and mortality to 13 July 2020. Results Residents (n=518) in 44 homes and staff (n=340) in 10 care homes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was identified in 103 residents in 14 homes and 49 staff in seven homes. Of 103 SARS-CoV-2+ residents, just 38 had typical symptom(s) at time of test (new cough and/or fever). Amongst 54 residents who were completely asymptomatic when tested, 12 (22%) developed symptoms within 14 days. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative residents, SARS-CoV-2+ residents were more likely to exhibit typical symptoms (new cough (n=26, p=0.001); fever (n=24, p=<0.001)) or as generally-unwell (n=18, p=0.001). Of 38 resident deaths, 21 (55%) were initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2, all of whom tested SARS-CoV-2+. One death not initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2 also tested positive. Conclusion Testing identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2+ residents and staff. Being generally-unwell was common amongst symptomatic residents and may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in older people in the absence of more typical symptoms. Where a resident appears generally unwell SARS-CoV-2-infection should be suspected. Protocols for testing involved integrated health and social care teams.","Smith, E.; Aldus, C.

64,Analysis of the potential impact of genomic variants in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India on molecular diagnostic assays,"An isolated epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus Diseases (C0VID-19) originating in Wuhan, China has now rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.

65,Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic is ongoing, and to know how far the virus has spread in Niger State, Nigeria, a pilot study was carried out to determine the COVID-19 seroprevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors in the state. A cross sectional study design and clustered-stratified-Random sampling strategy were used. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Kits (Colloidal gold immunochromatography lateral flow system) were used to determine the presence or absence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of sampled participants across Niger State as from 26th June 2020 to 30th June 2020. The test kits were validated using the blood samples of some of the NCDC confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 cases in the State. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Test results were entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered simultaneously with each test. EPIINFO was then used for both the descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data generated. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. A seroprevalence of 37.21% was recorded among health care workers in Niger State. Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus. If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face/nose masks and observation of social/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus.","Majiya, H.; Aliyu-Paiko, M.; Balogu, V.

In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models.

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, F.; Mears, J.

70,A valid protective immune response elicited in rhesus macaques by an inactivated vaccine is capable of defending against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"With the relatively serious global epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, public concerns focus on not only clinical therapeutic measures and public quarantine for this disease but also the development of vaccines. The technical design of our SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine provides a viral antigen that enables the exposure of more than one structural protein based upon the antibody composition of COVID-19 patients convalescent serum. This design led to valid immunity with increasing neutralizing antibody titers and a CTL response detected post-immunization of this vaccine by two injections in rhesus macaques. Further, this elicited immunoprotection in macaques enables not only to restrain completely viral replication in tissues of immunized animals, compared to the adjuvant control and those immunized by an RBD peptide vaccine, but also to significantly alleviate inflammatory lesion in lung tissues in histo-pathologic detection, compared to the adjuvant control with developed interstitial pneumonia. The data obtained from these macaques immunized with the inactivated vaccine or RBD peptide vaccine suggest that immunity with a clinically protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection should include not only specific neutralizing antibodies but also specific CTL responses against at least the S and N antigens.","Chen, H.; Xie, Z.; Long, R.; Fan, S.; Li, H.; He, Z.; Xu, K.; Liao, Y.; Wang, L.; Zhang, Y.; Li, X.; Dong, X.; Mou, T.; Zhou, X.; Yang, Y.; Guo, L.; Yang, J.; Zheng, H.; Xu, X.; Li, J.; Liang, Y.; Li, D.; Zhao, Z.; Hong, C.; Zhao, H.; Jiang, G.; Che, Y.; Yang, F.; Hu, Y.; Wang, X.; Pu, J.; Ma, K.; Wang, L.; Chen, C.; Duan, W.; Shen, D.; Zhao, H.; Jiang, R.; Deng, X.; Li, Y.; Zhu, H.; Zhou, J.; Yu, L.; Xu, M.; Yang, H.; Yi, L.; Zhou, Z.; Yang, J.; Duan, N.; Yang, H.; Zhao, W.; Yang, W.; Li, C.; Liu, L.; Li, Q.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235747v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235747v1?rss=1,2020-08-04,2020-08-04,,False
71,A distinct innate immune signature marks progression from mild to severe COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with a range of severities, but immune signatures of mild and severe disease are still not fully understood. Excessive inflammation has been postulated to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and innate immune mechanisms are likely to be central in the inflammatory response. We used 40-plex mass cytometry and targeted serum proteomics to profile innate immune cell populations from peripheral blood of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and healthy controls. Sampling at different stages of COVID-19 allowed us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate immune response. Despite the expected patient heterogeneity, we identified consistent changes during the course of the infection. A rapid and early surge of CD169+ monocytes associated with an IFN{gamma}+MCP-2+ signature quickly followed symptom onset; at symptom onset, patients with mild and severe COVID-19 had a similar signature, but over the course of the disease, the differences between patients with mild and severe disease increased. Later in the disease course, we observed a more pronounced re-appearance of intermediate/non-classical monocytes and mounting systemic CCL3 and CCL4 levels in patients with severe disease. Our data provide new insights into the dynamic nature of the early inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and identifies sustained pathological innate immune responses as a likely key mechanism in severe COVID-19, further supporting investigation of targeted anti-inflammatory interventions in severe COVID-19.","Chevrier, S.; Zurbuchen, Y.; Cervia, C.; Adamo, S.; Raeber, M.

72,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and transmission in domestic cats","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the current pandemic. Recent SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and transmission studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4- to 5-month-old cats were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post challenge (DPC), two sentinel contact cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding throughout the 21 DPC observation period. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and 21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of comingling. The results of this study are critical for our understanding of the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment of the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 in felines and transmission to other animals and humans.","Gaudreault, N.

73,Pathogenetic Perspective of Missense Mutations of ORF3a Protein of SARS-CoV2,"One of the most important proteins for COVID-19 pathogenesis in SARS-CoV2 is the ORF3a protein which is the largest accessory protein among others accessory proteins coded by coronavirus genome. The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non- synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","Hassan, S.

75,Lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation is a hallmark of severe COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a broad clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. Different features associated with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation and reduction of peripheral CD8+ T cell counts are strongly associated with severe disease. Here, we confirm the reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells both in relative and absolute terms and identify T cell apoptosis and migration into inflamed tissues as possible mechanisms driving peripheral T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, we find evidence of elevated serum interleukin-7, thus indicating systemic T cell paucity and signs of increased T cell proliferation in patients with severe lymphopenia. Following T cell lymphopenia in our pseudo-longitudinal time course, we observed expansion and recovery of poly-specific antiviral T cells, thus arguing for lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation. In summary, this study suggests that extensive T cell loss and subsequent T cell proliferation are characteristic of severe COVID-19.","Adamo, S.; Chevrier, S.; Cervia, C.; Zurbuchen, Y.; Räber, M.

We investigated the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains and present the first data on viruses circulating in the country.

MethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing and data analysis of SARS-CoV-2 eleven strains isolated in March and May.

ResultsStrains from travelers clustered with those from China, Saudi Arabia, India, USA and Australia. Five of eight SARS-CoV-2 strains were GH clade with Spike glycoprotein D614G, Ns3 gene Q57H, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P4715L mutations. Two were S (ORF8 L84S and N S202N) and three were L clade and one was an I clade strain. One GH and one L strain each displayed Orf1ab L3606F indicating further evolutionary transitions.

ConclusionsThis data reveals SARS-CoV-2 strains of L, G, S and I have been circulating in Pakistan from March, at the start of the pandemic. It indicates viral diversity regarding infection in this populous region. Continuing molecular genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of disease severity will be important to understand virus transmission patterns and host related determinants of COVID-19 in Pakistan.","Ghanchi, N.

At this date more than 680 thousand people have died due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Unfortunately, until now no effective treatment to combat the virus and vaccine are available. We performed experiments to test if hypertonic saline solution is able to inhibit virus replication in vitro. Our data shows that 260 mM NaCl (1.5%) inhibits 100% SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the virus replication inhibition is due to an intracellular mechanism and not due to the dissociation between spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. NaCl depolarizes the plasma membrane supposedly associated with the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. This observation could lead to simple, safe and low cost interventions at various stages of COVID-19 treatment, improving the prognosis of infected patients, thereby mitigating the social and economic costs of the pandemic.","Machado, R.

78,Analytical validity of nanopore sequencing for rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis,"Viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides critical insight into the transmission and evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, we performed viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. Despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >98% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives.","Bull, R.

A safe and effective vaccine that can provide herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to stop the spread of this virus among humans. Many human viral vaccines are live attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe the development of a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03-CA22{degrees}C/2020) by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37{degrees}C to 22{degrees}C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans through nasal spray. Its single dose was observed to strongly induce the neutralising antibody (>640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibody in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show loss of body weight, death, and the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys.

82,SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98,"RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 {Delta}22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

ImportanceSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-2s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins, Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.","Addetia, A.; Lieberman, N.

84,Mechanism of duplex unwinding by coronavirus nsp13 helicases,"The current COVID-19 pandemic urges in-depth investigation into proteins encoded with coronavirus (CoV), especially conserved CoV replicases. The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3 or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible 1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family.

O_LIWhen dTTP was used as the energy source, 4 hidden steps in each individual unwinding step after 3 - 4 NTP hydrolysis were observed.

Here we determined a crystal structure of COVA1-16 Fab with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and a negative-stain EM reconstruction with the spike glycoprotein trimer, to elucidate the structural basis of its cross-reactivity. COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly through a long CDR H3, and competes with ACE2 binding due to steric hindrance rather than epitope overlap. COVA1-16 binds to a flexible up conformation of the RBD on the spike and relies on antibody avidity for neutralization. These findings, along with structural and functional rationale for the epitope conservation, provide a blueprint for development of more universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines and therapies.","Liu, H.; Wu, N.

Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate-immune TRAIL suppress transformed and virally-infected cells. ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity. We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine increase cleaved active SP-domain of TMPRSS2, and this is potentiated by MEKi. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19- (+) patient plasma (N=9) versus control (N=11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M- CSF, IL-1a, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or in combination with remdesivir. MEKi enhance NK cell (but not T-cell) killing of target-cells, without suppressing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity.

Heterodimer structures are determined with the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or the SAH analog sinefungin (SFG). Furthermore, structures of nsp16/nsp10 with the methylated Cap-0 analog (m7GpppA) and SAM or SAH bound were obtained. Comparative analysis revealed flexible loops in open and closed conformations at the m7GpppA binding pocket. Bound sulfates in several structures suggested the location of the phosphates in the ribonucleotide binding groove. Additional nucleotide binding sites were found on the face of the protein opposite the active site. These various sites and the conserved dimer interface could be exploited for development of antiviral inhibitors.","Rosas-Lemus, M.; Minasov, G.; Shuvalova, L.; Inniss, N.; Kiryukhina, O.; Brunzelle, J.; Satchell, K.

89,Similarity between mutation spectra in hypermutated genomes of rubella virus and in SARS-CoV-2 genomes accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Genomes of tens of thousands of SARS-CoV2 isolates have been sequenced across the world and the total number of changes (predominantly single base substitutions) in these isolates exceeds ten thousand. We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella - another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2 - likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","Gordenin, D.

90,De novo design of picomolar SARS-CoV-2 miniprotein inhibitors,"We used two approaches to design proteins with shape and chemical complementarity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein near the binding site for the human ACE2 receptor. Scaffolds were built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the RBD, or de novo designed scaffolds were docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes. In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these -- 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach -- are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC50 ~ 0.23 ng/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously. These hyperstable minibinders provide promising starting points for new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, and illustrate the power of computational protein design for rapidly generating potential therapeutic candidates against pandemic threats.","Baker, D.; Cao, L.; Goreshnik, I.; Coventry, B.; Case, J.

91,De novo design of ACE2 protein decoys to neutralize SARS-CoV-2,"There is an urgent need for the ability to rapidly develop effective countermeasures for emerging biological threats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a generalized computational design strategy to rapidly engineer de novo proteins that precisely recapitulate the protein surface targeted by biological agents, like viruses, to gain entry into cells. The designed proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational escape. Using our novel platform, in less than ten weeks, we engineered, validated, and optimized de novo protein decoys of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the membrane-associated protein that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect cells. Our optimized designs are hyperstable de novo proteins ([~]18-37 kDa), have high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and can potently inhibit the virus infection and replication in vitro. Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid development of other therapeutic de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to cause disease.","Linsky, T.

92,PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Reveals Important Insights into the Outbreak,"The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium has achieved its initial goal of completing the sequencing of 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs collected from individuals testing positive for COVID-19 by Real Time PCR. The samples were collected across 10 states covering different zones within India. Given the importance of this information for public health response initiatives investigating transmission of COVID-19, the sequence data is being released in GISAID database. This information will improve our understanding on how the virus is spreading, ultimately helping to interrupt the transmission chains, prevent new cases of infection, and provide impetus to research on intervention measures. This will also provide us with information on evolution of the virus, genetic predisposition (if any) and adaptation to human hosts.

One thousand and fifty two sequences were used for phylodynamic, temporal and geographic mutation patterns and haplotype network analyses. Initial results indicate that multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in India, probably introduced by travel from Europe, USA and East Asia. A2a (20A/B/C) was found to be predominant, along with few parental haplotypes 19A/B. In particular, there is a predominance of the D614G mutation, which is found to be emerging in almost all regions of the country. Additionally, mutations in important regions of the viral genome with significant geographical clustering have also been observed. The temporal haplotype diversities landscape in each region appears to be similar pan India, with haplotype diversities peaking between March-May, while by June A2a (20A/B/C) emerged as the predominant one. Within haplotypes, different states appear to have different proportions. Temporal and geographic patterns in the sequences obtained reveal interesting clustering of mutations. Some mutations are present at particularly high frequencies in one state as compared to others. The negative estimate Tajimas D (D = -2.26817) is consistent with the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 population in India. Detailed mutational analysis across India to understand the gradual emergence of mutants at different regions of the country and its possible implication will help in better disease management.","Maitra, A.; Raghav, S.; Dalal, A.; Ali, F.; Paynter, V.

The cyclic peptide inhibitor is designed to mimic the conformation of a substrate at a C-terminal autolytic cleavage site of Mpro. Synthesis and evaluation of a first-generation cyclic peptide inhibitor reveals that the inhibitor is active against Mpro in vitro and is non-toxic toward human cells in culture. The initial hit described in this manuscript, UCI-1, lays the groundwork for the development of additional cyclic peptide inhibitors against Mpro with improved activities.","Kreutzer, A.

94,"Purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike, its receptor binding domain, and CR3022 mAb for serological assay","Serology testing for COVID-19 is highly attractive because of the relatively short diagnosis time and the ability to test for an active immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. In many types of serology tests, the sensitivity and the specificity are directly influenced by the quality of the antigens manufactured. Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins [most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spike-expressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time. HSPG-spike interaction could play a functional role in the pathology and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","Tee, K. L.; Jackson, P. J.; Scarrott, J. M.; Jaffe, S.

95,A Systemic and Molecular Study of Subcellular Localization of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,"Coronavirus possesses the largest RNA genome among all the RNA viruses. Its genome encodes about 29 proteins. Most of the viral proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) except envelop (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins that constitute the viral nucleocapsid, envelop and surface. We have recently cloned all the 29 SARS-CoV-2 genes into vectors for their expressions in mammalian cells except NSP11 that has only 14 amino acids (aa). We are able to express all the 28 cloned SARS-CoV-2 genes in human cells to characterize their subcellular distributions. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly cytoplasmic but some are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Those punctate staining proteins were further investigated by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using specific antibodies or by co-transfection with an organelle marker-expressing plasmid. As a result, we found that NSP15, ORF6, M and ORF7a are related to Golgi apparatus, and that ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, ORF3a distributes in cell membrane, early endosome, endosome, late endosome and lysosome, which suggests that ORF3a might help the infected virus to usurp endosome and lysosome for viral use. Furthermore, we revealed that NSP13 colocalized with SC35, a protein standing for splicing compartments in the nucleus. Our studies for the first time visualized the subcellular locations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and might provide novel insights into the viral proteins biological functions.","Zhang, J.; Cruz-cosme, R.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Liu, D.; Liu, Y.; Teng, S.; Wang, P.-H.; Tang, Q.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.02.233023v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.02.233023v1?rss=1,2020-08-02,2020-08-02,,False
96,A New Model of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Based on (Hydroxy)Chloroquine Activity,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (H)CQ are well known anti-malarial drugs, while their use against COVID-19 is more controversial. (H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis. The description of (H)CQ function presented here, together with its implications for understanding SARS-CO-V2 infection, makes testable predictions about disease progression and identifies new approaches for treating COVID-19.","Sheaff, R.

97,Rapid Inactivation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) Photocatalysis,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets and, likely, via smaller droplet nuclei light enough to remain suspended in the air for hours and contaminate surfaces particularly in indoor conditions. Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor environments.","Ghezzi, S.; Pagani, I.; Poli, G.; Perboni, S.; Vicenzi, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.232199v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.232199v1?rss=1,2020-08-02,2020-08-02,,False
98,Hybrid capture-based sequencing enables unbiased recovery of SAR-CoV-2 genomes from fecal samples and characterization of the dynamics of intra-host variants,"BackgroundIn response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to understand the origin, transmission, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, which relies on close surveillance of genomic diversity in clinical samples. Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples.

MethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.

ResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.

ConclusionsThe hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.","Li, M.; Xu, Y.; Kang, L.; Shen, Z.; Li, X.; Wu, W.; Ma, W.; Fang, C.; Yang, F.; Jiang, X.; Gong, S.; Zhang, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.230102v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.230102v1?rss=1,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,,False

The scientific literature on clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh is scarce. This study aimed to report the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study at three dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. The severity of the COVID-19 cases was assessed based on the WHO interim guidance. Data were collected only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critical patients required immediate intensive care admission making them unable to respond to the questions. A total of 103 RT-PCR confirmed non-critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Most of the patients (71.8%) were male. Mild, moderate and severe illness were assessed in 74.76%, 9.71% and 15.53% of patients respectively. Nearly 52.4% of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (34%), followed by diabetes mellitus (21.4%) and ischemic heart disease (9.7%). Fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and cough (44.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered sensation of taste or smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). The median time from onset of symptom to attending hospitals was 7 days (IQR 4-10).
