0,"Comparing the Fit of N95, KN95, Surgical, and Cloth Face Masks and Assessing the Accuracy of Fit Checking","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has made well-fitting face masks a critical piece of protective equipment for healthcare workers and civilians. While the importance of wearing face masks has been acknowledged, there remains a lack of understanding about the role of good fit in rendering protective equipment useful. In addition, supply chain constraints have caused some organizations to abandon traditional quantitative or qualitative fit testing, and instead, have implemented subjective fit checking. Our study seeks to quantitatively evaluate the level of fit offered by various types of masks, and most importantly, assess the accuracy of implementing fit checks by comparing fit check results to quantitative fit testing results. Methods: Seven participants first evaluated N95 and KN95 masks by performing a fit check. Participants then underwent quantitative fit testing wearing five N95 masks, a KN95 mask, a surgical mask, and fabric masks. Results: N95 masks offered higher degrees of protection than the other categories of masks tested; however, it should be noted that most N95 masks failed to fit the participants adequately. Fit check responses had poor correlation with quantitative fit scores. All non-N95 masks achieved low fit scores. Conclusion: Fit is critical to the level of protection offered by masks. For an N95 mask to provide the promised protection, it must fit the participant. Performing a fit check was an unreliable way of determining fit.","O'Kelly, E.; Arora, A.; Pirog, S.; Ward, J.; Clarkson, P.

1,Real-time spatial health surveillance: mapping the UK COVID-19 epidemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for robust data linkage systems and methods for identifying outbreaks of disease in near real-time. Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. A pre-requisite to an effective control strategy is that predictions need to be accompanied by estimates of their precision, to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","Fry, R.; Hollinghurst, J.; Stagg, H.

2,Summer COVID-19 third wave: faster high altitude spread suggests high UV adaptation,"We present spread parameters for first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemy for USA states, and third wave for 32 regions (19 countries and 13 states of the USA) detected beginning of August 2020. USA first/second wave spreads increase/decrease with population density, are uncorrelated with temperature and median population age. Pooling all 32 regions, third wave spread is slower than for first wave, similar to second wave, and increases with mean altitude (second wave slopes decrease above 900m). Apparently, viruses adapted in spring (second wave) to high temperatures and infecting the young, and in summer (third) waves for spread at altitudes above 1000m. Third wave slopes are not correlated to temperature, so patterns with elevation presumably indicate resistance to relatively high UV regimes. Environmental trends of the COVID-19 pandemy change at incredible rates, making predictions based on classical epidemiological knowledge particularly uncertain.","Seligmann, H.; Vuillerme, N.; Demongeot, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176628v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176628v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
3,The Mental Health of Healthcare Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: It Depends on How Much They Work and Their Age,"Background: Healthcare staff are the forefront of fight against COVID-19 and they are under enormous pressure due to the fast growth in the number and severity of infected cases. This creates their mental issues such as distress, depression and anxiety. Exploring healthcare staff's mental health during the pandemic contributes to improving their persistence in the growing challenges created by COVID-19 and enabling effective management of their mental health. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all the 31 provinces of Iran was conducted during April 5 to 20, 2020. The survey assessed staff's distress, depression and anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff suffered from distress, depression and anxiety. Females and more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Compared to personnel who did not have COVID-19, those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression. The number of COVID-19 cases among the staff's colleagues or friends positively predicted their anxiety. Compared to radio technologists, doctors were less likely to experience distress and anxiety. Technicians and obstetrics experienced less anxiety. Analysis the interaction between weekly working days and age of the staff indicated the chance of experiencing distress and depression varied greatly by working days among younger but not older healthcare staff. Conclusion: Exploring the potential predictors of mental health issues assists healthcare organizations to develop approaches to prevent and decrease the issues among staff and improve their task performance in sever crises such as COVID-19, so they can stay motivated in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is useful to identify more working characteristic predictors for healthcare staff at different ages.","Xu, X.; Zhang, S.

4,Machine learning and AI aided tool to differentiate COVID 19 and non-COVID 19 lung CXR,"One of the main challenges in dealing with the current COVID 19 pandemic is how to detect and distinguish between the COVID 19 and non COVID 19 cases. This problem arises since COVID 19 symptoms resemble with other cases. One of the golden standards is by examining the lung using the chest X ray radiograph (CXR). Currently there is growing COVID 19 cases followed by the CXR images waiting to be analyzed and this may outnumber the health capacity. Learning from that current situation and to fulfill the demand for CXRs analysis, a novel solution is required. The tool is expected can detect and distinguish the COVID 19 case lung rely on CXR. Respectively, this study aims to propose the use of AI and machine learning aided tool to distinguish the COVID 19 and non COVID 19 cases based on the CXR lung image. The compared non COVID 19 CXR cases in this study include normal (healthy), influenza A, tuberculosis, and active smoker. The results confirm that the machine learning tool is able to distinguish the COVID 19 CXR lungs based on lung consolidation. Moreover, the tool is also able to recognize an abnormality of COVID 19 lung in the form of patchy ground glass opacity.","Adwibowo, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20175521v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20175521v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
5,Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy,"Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19. They point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways and set the stage for larger prospective trials that will benchmark these complement-targeting agents in COVID-19.","Mastellos, D.

6,"Pediatric surgical services in Bangladesh during the COVID 19 pandemic: How they are affected and how to overcome the backlog, keeping healthcare professionals safe.","Background: Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has turned into a pandemic. All countries have implemented multiple strategies to try mitigating the losses caused by this virus. To stop the rapid spread of the disease and in compliance with the World Health Organizations social distancing policy, the government of Bangladesh has implemented a number of strategies, one of which is to limit the spread of the virus in hospitals by postponing elective procedures and providing only emergency services in the hospitals. The objective of this survey was to assess the current status of pediatric surgical procedures in different hospitals in Bangladesh and assess the effects of the current restrictions along with their implications in the long run. Materials and Methods: A survey was performed among doctors from public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the status on pediatric surgery. Results: The results clearly revealed the lack of a significant reduction in doctors exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by postponing elective procedures. Conclusion: Keeping in mind the socioeconomic and health care conditions of the country, the author recommend resuming elective surgical procedures.

7,"Keep calm and carry on: safety, feasibility and early outcomes of head and neck cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Patients with cancer are considered at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and increased severity of infection. Anti-cancer treatment may further increase those risks. The aim of this work is to report early outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated during the pandemic. Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort study in a UK tertiary level oncology centre between 1st March and 23 June 2020, including patients with HNC who were either newly diagnosed, had developed new recurrent/metastatic disease, or were already scheduled to receive treatment during that period. Results 200 patients were evaluated. Median age was 64 years, 65.5% had multiple co-morbidities, 77.5% were current or ex-smokers and 59.5% lived in areas of deprivation. 99 patients were treated with 6 weeks of radical (chemo) radiotherapy. Systemic anti-cancer treatment was delivered to 40 patients. 2 (1.0%) patients with HNC had confirmed COVID-19 infection; 1 patient prior to primary radical RT - no delay to treatment was required and RT was completed as planned, 1 patient acquired COVID-19 after primary surgery but recovered well and started adjuvant RT 9.7 weeks after surgery. The proportion of patients receiving supportive care only (19.5%) was in keeping with that pre-COVID-19. The proportion of patients not completing (chemo) radiotherapy (3.4%) or with gaps in treatment (14.1%) was similar to pre-COVID-19. 30-day mortality after radical (chemo)radiotherapy was 2.3%, no higher than in previous years. Conclusions It is feasible and safe to deliver standard treatment for patients with HNC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Walker, S.; Thomson, M. C.; Campbell, F.; Hay, L.

8,"Use, reuse or discard: quantitatively defined variance in N95 respirator integrity following vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: COVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking. Aims: 1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination. Methods: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP. Findings: There was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions. Conclusions: Our data revealed variability in the integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and reuse programs.","Levine, C.; Grady, C.; Block, T.; Hurley, H.; Russo, R.; Peixoto, B.; Frees, A.; Ruiz, A.; Alland, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177071v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
9,Breastmilk; a source of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA antibodies,"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many put their hopes in the rapid development of effective immunizations. For now patient isolation, physical distancing and good hygiene are the sole measures for prevention. Processed breast milk with antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 may serve as additional protection. We aimed to determine the presence and neutralization capacity of antibodies against SaRS-CoV-2 in breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Serum and breastmilk was collected. To assess the presence of antibodies in breastmilk and serum, we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for total Ig. To assess the effect of pasteurization breastmilk was exposed to Holder Pasteurization and High Pressure Pasteurization. Results: Breastmilk contained antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using any of the assays in 24 out of 29 (83%) proven cases, in six out of nine (67%) suspected cases and in none of the 13 controls. In vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate virus strain was successful in a subset of serum (13%) and milk samples (26%). Although after pasteurization of the milk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected with both methods of pasteurization, virus neutralizing capacity of those antibodies was only retained with the HPP approach. Conclusion: Breastmilk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19 contains significant amounts of IgA against SARS-CoV-2, both before and after pasteurization.","van Keulen, B.

10,Clinical Characterisation of Lateral Flow Assays for Detection of COVID-19 Antibodies in a population,"Importance: Serological assays can help diagnose and determine the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population. Objective: We characterized and compared 11 different lateral flow assays for their performance in diagnostic or epidemiological settings. Design, Setting, Participants: We used two cohorts to determine the speci- ficity: (i) up to 350 blood donor samples from past influenza seasons and (ii) up to 110 samples which tested PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Switzerland. The sensitivity was determined using up to 370 samples which tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same time and is representative for age distribution and severity. Main Outcome: We found a single test usable for epidemiological studies in the current low-prevalence setting, all other tests showed lacking sensitivity or specificity for a usage in either epidemiological or diagnostic setting. However, orthogonal testing by combining two tests without common cross-reactivities makes testing in a low-prevalence setting feasible. Results: Nine out of the eleven tests showed specificities below 99%, only five of eleven tests showed sensitivities comparable to established ELISAs, and only one ful- filled both criteria. Contrary to previous results from lab assays, five tests measured an IgM response in >80% of the samples. We found no common cross-reactivities, which allows orthogonal testing schemes for five tests of sufficient sensitivities. Conclusions and Relevance: This study emphasizes the need for large and diverse negative cohorts when determining specificities, and for diverse and repre- sentative positive samples when determining sensitivities of lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Failure to adhere to statistically relevant sample sizes or cohorts exclusively made up of hospitalised patients fails to accurately capture the performance of these assays in epidemiological settings. Our results allow a rational choice between tests for different use cases.","rudolf, f.; Kaltenbach, H.-M.; linnik, J.; Ruf, M.-T.; Niederhauser, C.; Nickel, B.; Gygax, D.; Savic, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177204v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177204v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
11,"Decline of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and IgA in convalescent COVID-19 patients within 100 days after hospital discharge","Monitoring the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies such as IgG, M and A in COVID-19 patient is an alternative method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and an simple way to monitor immune responses in convalescent patients and after vaccination. Here, we assessed the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in twenty-seven COVID-19 convalescent patients over 28-99 days after hospital discharge. Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients' RBD-specific IgG reaches to an undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively. This investigation and report will aid current and future studies to develope SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are potent and long-lasting.","Ma, H.; Zhao, D.; Zeng, W.; Yang, Y.; Hu, X.; Zhou, P.; Weng, J.; Cheng, L.; Zheng, X.; Jin, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20175950v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20175950v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
12,"Accurately Differentiating COVID-19, Other Viral Infection, and Healthy Individuals Using Multimodal Features via Late Fusion Learning","Effectively identifying COVID-19 patients using non-PCR clinical data is critical for the optimal clinical outcomes. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of various biomedical features and appropriate technical approaches to accurately detecting COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients in non-severe (NS) and 148 in severe (S) clinical type, 198 non-infected healthy (H) participants and 129 non-COVID viral pneumonia (V) patients. The participants' clinical information (23 features), lab testing results (10 features), and thoracic CT scans upon admission were acquired as three input feature modalities. To enable late fusion of multimodality data, we developed a deep learning model to extract a 10-feature high-level representation of the CT scans. Exploratory analyses showed substantial differences of all features among the four classes. Three machine learning models (k-nearest neighbor kNN, random forest RF, and support vector machine SVM) were developed based on the 43 features combined from all three modalities to differentiate four classes (NS, S, V, and H) at once. All three models had high accuracy to differentiate the overall four classes (95.4%-97.7%) and each individual class (90.6%-99.9%). Multimodal features provided substantial performance gain from using any single feature modality. Compared to existing binary classification benchmarks often focusing on single feature modality, this study provided a novel and effective breakthrough for clinical applications. Findings and the analytical workflow can be used as clinical decision support for current COVID-19 and other clinical applications with high-dimensional multimodal biomedical features.","Xu, M.; Ouyang, L.; Gao, Y.; Chen, Y.; Yu, T.; Li, Q.; Sun, K.; Bao, F.

14,Iota carrageenan and xylitol inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell culture,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affecting millions of persons around the world. There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 mcg/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","Vega, J. C.; Bansal, S.; Jonsson, C. B.; Taylor, S.

15,Temporal landscape of mutation accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh: possible implications from the ongoing outbreak in Bangladesh,"Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population. Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","Saha, O.; Shatadru, R.

17,Targeting pentose phosphate pathway for SARS-CoV-2 therapy,"It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","Bojkova, D.; Costa, R.; Bechtel, M.; Ciesek, S.; Michaelis, M.; Cinatl, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
18,SARS-CoV-2 infects brain choroid plexus and disrupts the blood-CSF-barrier,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leads primarily to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal, particularly in at risk individuals. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","Pellegrini, L.; Albecka, A.; Mallery, D.

19,In Silico Modeling of Virus Particle Propagation and Infectivity along the Respiratory Tract: A Case Study for SARS-COV-2,"Respiratory viruses including Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus and cornaviruses such as Middle Eastern respiratory virus (MERS) and SARS-CoV-2 infect and cause serious and sometimes fatal disease in thousands of people annually. It is critical to understand virus propagation dynamics within the respiratory system because new insights will increase our understanding of virus pathogenesis and enable infection patterns to be more predictable in vivo, which will enhance targeting of vaccines and drug delivery. This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network.

20,Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic β-CoVs,"The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.","Pontes, C.; Ruiz-Serra, V.

21,Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.","Lapointe, C.

22,"Astodrimer sodium, dendrimer antiviral, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, J.

23,Ubiquitous Forbidden Order in R-group classified protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses,"Each amino acid in a polypeptide chain has a distinctive R-group associated with it. We report here a novel method of species characterization based upon the order of these R-group classified amino acids in the linear sequence of the side chains associated with the codon triplets. In an otherwise pseudo-random sequence, we search for forbidden combinations of kth order. We applied this method to analyze the available protein sequences of various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We found that these ubiquitous forbidden orders (UFO) are unique to each of the viruses we analyzed. This unique structure of the viruses may provide an insight into viruses chemical behavior and the folding patterns of the proteins.

24,Morphometry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 particles in ultrathin sections of infected Vero cell cultures.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative of the COVID-19 disease, which has spread pandemically around the globe within a few months. It is therefore of great interest to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 140 nm. SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The peplomer density was measured using very thin sections and showed a difference between the two virus isolates. SARS-CoV displayed one-third more peplomers per segmental particle volume than SARS-CoV-2. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, using another isolate of the SARS-CoV-2, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","Laue, M.; Kauter, A.; Hoffmann, T.; Michel, J.; Nitsche, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
25,COVID-19 and Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway: In silico Identification of an Interaction between alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and the Cryptic Epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR.

26,Characterization of cells susceptible to SARS-COV-2 and methods for detection of neutralizing antibody by focus forming assay,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the urgent need to determine what cells are susceptible to infection and for assays to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the ongoing efforts for vaccine development have necessitated the development of rapid, high-throughput methods of quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ability to screen human polyclonal sera samples for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, our lab has adapted focus forming assays for SARS-CoV-2 using Vero CCL-81 cells, referred to in this text as Vero WHO. Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test. We have shown that this assay is a sensitive tool for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer in human, non-human primate, and mouse polyclonal sera following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, we describe the viral growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of different immortalized cell lines and demonstrate via human ACE2 and viral spike protein expression that these cell lines can support viral entry and replication.","Stone, E.

27,Retrospective screening of routine respiratory samples revealed undetected community transmission and missed intervention opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom,"In the early phases of the SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, testing focused on individuals fitting a strict case definition involving a limited set of symptoms together with an identified epidemiological risk, such as contact with an infected individual or travel to a high-risk area. To assess whether this impaired our ability to detect and control early introductions of the virus into the UK, we PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to a large UK teaching hospital who retrospectively were identified as having a clinical presentation compatible with COVID-19. In addition, we screened available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, and dating back to early January 2020, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our data provides evidence for widespread community circulation of SARS-CoV2 in early February 2020 and into March that was undetected at the time due to restrictive case definitions informing testing policy. Genome sequence data showed that many of these early cases were infected with a distinct lineage of the virus. Sequences obtained from the first officially recorded case in Nottinghamshire - a traveller returning from Daegu, South Korea - also clustered with these early UK sequences suggesting acquisition of the virus occurred in the UK and not Daegu. Analysis of a larger sample of sequences obtained in the Nottinghamshire area revealed multiple viral introductions, mainly in late February and through March. These data highlight the importance of timely and extensive community testing to prevent future widespread transmission of the virus.","Chappell, J.

28,On COVID-19-safety ranking of seats in intercontinental commercial aircrafts: A preliminary multiphysics computational perspective,"The evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into a pandemic has severely hampered the usage of public transit systems. In a post-COVID-19 world, we may see an increased reliance on autonomous cars and personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with inherent physical distancing, over buses, trains, and aircraft for intracity, intercity, and interstate travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted from the nose/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy of the aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).","Desai, P.

29,Inadequate preparedness for response to COVID-19 is associated with stress and burnout among healthcare workers in Ghana,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the global crisis of stress and burnout among healthcare workers (HCWs). But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes. We examined the association between perceived preparedness to respond to the pandemic and HCW stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among HCWs in Ghana. Methods: Data are from HCWs in Ghana who completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey; 414 and 409 HCWs completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial measures. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. Results: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD=8.8), 16.3 (SD=5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD=15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress ({beta}=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and {beta}=-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) and burnout ({beta}=-7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and {beta}=-9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to - 4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. Conclusion: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions to increase HCWs' morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.","Afulani, P. A.; Gyamerah, A.

30,SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays in Control and Unknown Populations Demonstrate the Necessity of Virus Neutralization Testing.,"Background: To determine how serologic antibody testing outcome links with virus neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain immune protection status, we evaluated a unique set of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection and viral neutralization. Methods: Herein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In control populations, the best performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3 (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2), spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2). Conclusion: These data suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration. One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to neutralizing immunity.","Rathe, J.

32,Covid-19 transmission dynamics during the unlock phase and significance of testing,"The pandemic disease Covid-19 caused by SARS-COV-2, which emerged from Wuhan, China, has established itself as the most devastating disease in the history of infectious disease, affecting 216 countries/territories across the world. Different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. Though some countries have come out of this pandemic, the infection is still increasing and remains very serious in the rest of the world. Even when the disease is not under control, many countries have withdrawn the lockdown and going through the phase-wise unlocking process, causing a further increment in the infection rate. In such a scenario, the role of the undetected class of infected individuals has become very crucial. The present study is an attempt to understand and estimate the possible epidemic burden during the unlock phase in the presence of an undetected class. We proposed a modified SEIR model and dissected the epidemiological status of different countries with the available data. With the initial establishment of the model with the epidemic data of four countries, which have already attained the epidemic peak, the study focused more on countries like India and the USA, where the epidemic curve is still growing, but the unlock process has started. As a straightforward result, we noticed a significant increase in the undetected and detected infected cases under the ongoing unlock phase. Under such conditions, our recalibration exercise showed that an increase in the testing could revert the existing growth rate of the infected cases to the lower growth rate of the lockdown period. Our present study emphasizes on the implementation of 3T principles, trace, test, and treat, to contain the epidemic. The significance of large scale testing in controlling the epidemic is true for both India and the USA though they have different socio-economic conditions. The use of repurposing drugs may further decrease the infected cases and help the disease controlling process. We believe our proposed strategy obtained through a mathematical model will help to make a better policy for the unlock phase.","Paul, A.; Chatterjee, S.; Bairagi, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176354v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176354v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
33,Laboratory biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity and management.,"The heterogeneous disease course of COVID-19 is unpredictable, ranging from mild self-limiting symptoms to cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. Identification of high-risk cases will enable appropriate intervention and escalation. This study investigates the routine laboratory tests and cytokines implicated in COVID-19 for their potential application as biomarkers of disease severity, respiratory failure and need of higher-level care. From analysis of 203 samples, CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and LDH were most strongly correlated with the WHO ordinal scale of illness severity, the fraction of inspired oxygen delivery, radiological evidence of ARDS and level of respiratory support (p[&le;]0.001). IL-6 levels of >3.27pg/ml provide a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.64 for a requirement of ventilation, and a CRP of >37mg/L of 0.91 and 0.66. Reliable stratification of high-risk cases has significant implications on patient triage, resource management and potentially the initiation of novel therapies in severe patients.","Keddie, S.; Ziff, O.

34,"Severity-stratified and longitudinal analysis of VWF/ADAMTS13 imbalance, altered fibrin crosslinking and inhibition of fibrinolysis as contributors to COVID-19 coagulopathy","Background: Early clinical reports have suggested that the prevalence of thrombotic complications in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 may be as high as 30% in intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients and could be a major factor contributing to mortality. However, mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombo-coagulopathy, and its impact on patient morbidity and mortality, are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation and thromboinflammatory factors in plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Furthermore, we assessed the functional impact of these factors on clot formation and clot lysis. Results: Across all COVID-19 disease severities (mild, moderate and severe) we observed a significant increase (6-fold) in the concentration of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers compared to healthy controls. This is likely the result of an interleukin (IL)-6 driven imbalance of VWF and the regulatory protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Upregulation of this key pro-coagulant pathway may also be influenced by the observed increase (~6-fold) in plasma -defensins, a consequence of increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil activation. Markers of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte activation were accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of Factor XIII (FXIII) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. In patients with high FXIII we observed alteration of the fibrin network structure in in vitro assays of clot formation, which coupled with increased PAI-1, prolonged the time to clot lysis by the t-PA/plasmin fibrinolytic pathway by 52% across all COVID-19 patients (n=23). Conclusions: We show that an imbalance in the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis causing increased VWF reactivity may contribute to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Through immune and inflammatory responses, COVID-19 also alters the balance of factors involved in fibrin generation and fibrinolysis which accounts for the persistent fibrin deposition previously observed in post-mortem lung tissue.","South, K.; Roberts, L.; Morris, L.

35,SARS-CoV-2 Infections Among Children in the Biospecimens from Respiratory Virus-Exposed Kids (BRAVE Kids) Study,"BACKGROUND: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection typically have mild symptoms that do not require medical attention, leaving a gap in our understanding of the spectrum of illnesses that the virus causes in children. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","Hurst, J.

36,Convalescent plasma for patients with severe COVID-19: a matched cohort study,"Background The efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods A matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis. Results 64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 - 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR} 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused). Conclusions The use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly.

38,"Time-use and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a panel analysis of 55,204 adults followed across 11 weeks of lockdown in the UK","There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID 19 outbreak on mental health. But it remains unclear how individual behaviors could exacerbate or protect against adverse changes in mental health. This study aimed to examine the associations between specific activities (or time use) and mental health and wellbeing amongst people during the COVID 19 pandemic. Data were from the UCL COVID 19 Social Study; a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID 19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55,204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the strict 11 week lockdown period from 21st March to 31st May 2020. Data were analyzed using fixed effects and Arellano Bond models. We found that changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and wellbeing. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviors involving outdoor activities including gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing, while increased time spent on following news about COVID 19 predicted declines in mental health and wellbeing. These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies, and may help the public to maintain wellbeing during future pandemics.","Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Mak, H.

39,"Environmental risk factors of airborne viral transmission: Humidity, Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands","Objective: The relationship between specific humidity and influenza/SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands is evaluated over time and at regional level. Design: Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models-with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood-are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. Results: An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion: The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Public policies that promote higher levels of specific humidification-above 6 g/Kg-can lead to significant reductions in the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Ravelli, E.; Gonzales Martinez, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177444v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177444v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
40,Investigating dynamics of COVID-19 spread and containment with agent-based modeling,"Governments, policy makers and officials around the globe are trying to mitigate the effects and progress of the COVID-19 pandemic by making decisions which will save the most lives and impose the least costs. Making these decisions needs a comprehensive understanding about the dynamics by which the disease spreads. In this work, we propose an epidemic agent-based model that simulates the spread of the disease. We show that the model is able to generate an important aspect of the pandemic: multiple waves of infection. A key point in the model description is the aspect of 'fear' which can govern how agents behave under different conditions. We also show that the model provides an appropriate test-bed to apply different containment strategies and this work presents the results of applying two such strategies: testing, contact tracing, and travel restriction. The results show that while both strategies could result in flattening the epidemic curve and significantly reduce the maximum number of infected individuals; testing should be applied along with tracing previous contacts of the tested individuals to be effective. The results show how the curve is flattened with testing partnered with contact tracing, and the imposition of travel restrictions.","Rajabi, A.; Mantzaris, A. V.; Mutlu, E.

41,Role of IgM and IgA Antibodies to the Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people and is on a trajectory to kill more than one million globally. Virus entry depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although previous studies demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies as essential for protection and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes capable of blocking virus entry. Here, we studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in plasma/sera from two acutely infected and 29 convalescent individuals. Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 antibodies were produced by all or nearly all subjects at varying levels and detected at 7-8 days post-disease onset. IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgA2 were also present but at much lower levels. All samples also displayed neutralizing activity. IgM, IgG, and IgA were capable of mediating neutralization, but neutralization titers correlated better with binding levels of IgM and IgA1 than IgG.","Klingler, J.; Weiss, S.; Itri, V.; Liu, X.; Oguntuyo, K.

44,Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Modeling of COVID-19: Inequalities on Case-Fatality Risk,"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 challenges health systems and epidemiological responses of all countries worldwide. Although mitigation measures have been globally considered, the spatial heterogeneity of its effectiveness is evident, underscoring global health inequalities. Using Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, we evidenced that factors contributing to poverty are also risk factors for COVID-19 case-fatality, and unexpectedly, their impact on the case-fatality risk is comparable to that produced by health factors. Additionally, we confirm that both case-fatality risk and multidimensional poverty index have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, where the lastest consists of health, educational, dwelling, and employment dimensions. Spatio-temporal analysis reveals that the spatial heterogeneity in case-fatalities is associated with the percentage contribution of the health (RR 1.89 95%CI=1.43-2.48) and dwelling (RR 2.01 95%CI=1.37-2.63) dimensions to the multidimensional poverty, but also with the educational (RR 1.21 95%CI=1.03-1.49), and employment (RR 1.23 95%CI=1.02-1.47) dimensions. This spatial correlation indicates that the case-fatality risk increase by 189% and 201% in regions with a higher contribution of the health dimension (i.e., lack of health insurance and self-reporting) and dwelling dimension (i.e., lack of access to safe water, inadequate disposal of human feces, poor housing construction, and critical overcrowding), respectively. These findings assist policy-makers in the spatial and temporal planning of strategies focused on mitigating the case-fatality risk in most vulnerable communities and preparing for future pandemics by progressively reducing the factors that generate health inequality.","Polo, G.; Mera Acosta, C.; Soler-Tovar, D.; Porras Villamil, J.

45,Urban Sprawl of Covid-19 Epidemic in India: Lessons in the First Semester,"Background and Objective: The covid-19 epidemic is rapidly escalating in India and unlike developed countries there is no evidence of plateau or decline in the past 6 months. To evaluate association of state-level sociodemographics with incident cases and deaths we performed an ecological study. Methods: Publicly available data sources were used. Absolute number of covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained and cases and deaths/million in each state calculated from February to July 2020. To assess association of state level disease burden with sociodemographic variables (urbanization, human development, healthcare availability, healthcare access and quality etc.) we determined Pearson correlation and logarithmic trends. Results: Covid-19 in India has led to more than 2,000,000 cases and 45,000 deaths by end July 2020. There is large variation in state-level cases/million ranging from 7247 (Delhi), 3728 (Goa) and 3427 (Maharashtra) to less than 300/million in a few. Deaths/million range from 212 (Delhi), 122 (Maharashtra) and 51 (Tamilnadu) to 2 in north-eastern states. Most of the high burden states (except Delhi) are reporting increasing burden and deaths with the largest increase in July 2020. There is a significant positive correlation of urbanization with covid-19 cases (r= 0.65, R squared= 0.35) and deaths (r= 0.60, R squared= 0.28) and weaker correlation with other sociodemographic variables. From March to July 2020, stable R squared value for urbanization is observed with cases (0.37 to 0.39) while it is increasing for deaths (0.10 to 0.28).

The objective of the study was to report the clinical manifestation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: A online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted for initial recruitment of participants with subsequent telephone interview by the three trained physicians in 237 adults with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. The study period was between 27 April to 26th May, 2020. Consent was ensured before commencing the interview. Collected data were entered in a predesigned case report form and subsequently analyzed by SPSS 20. Results: The mean age at presentation was 41.59 (13.73 SD) years and most of the cases were male (73%). A total of 90.29% of patients reside in urban areas. Among the positive cases, 13.1% (n=31) were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic cases were significantly more common in households with 2 to 4 members (p=.008). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients shared similar ages of presentation (p=0.23), gender differences (p=0.30), and comorbidities (p=0.11). Only 5.3% of patients received ICU care during their treatment. The most frequent presentation was fever (88.3%), followed by cough (69.9%), chest pain (34.5%), body ache (31.1%), and sore throat (30.1%). Thirty-nine percent (n=92) of the patients had comorbidities, with diabetes and hypertension being the most frequently observed. Conclusion: There has been an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh.

47,COVID-19: Exhaled virus detected by Face Mask Sampling provides new links to disease severity and potential infectivity.,"Background Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) are the mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two studies. Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10/40 (25%) samples (4/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up. Interpretation FMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe disease.","Williams, C.; Pan, D.; Decker, J.; Wisniewska, A.; Sze, S.; Fletcher, E.; Haigh, R.; Abdulwhhab, M.; Bird, P.; Holmes, C.; Al-Taie, A.; Saleem, B.; Pan, J.; Garton, N.; Pareek, M.; Barer, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20176693v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
48,The ImmuneRACE Study: A Prospective Multicohort Study of Immune Response Action to COVID-19 Events with the ImmuneCODE™ Open Access Database,"Background: Adaptive Biotechnologies has built an immune medicine platform based on the sequencing of immune receptors (immunoglobulins, B-cell receptors [BCRs] and T-cell receptors [TCRs]) with myriad applications in health and disease. This broad platform technology can be used to assess the diversity of the cellular adaptive immune system and track disease-associated TCRs and BCRs during the course of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading rapidly throughout the world, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Researchers, governments, and biotechnology companies are mobilizing to develop and distribute diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives to try to curb this global pandemic. Methods: In collaboration with our partners LabCorp/Covance, Adaptive Biotechnologies has opened the ImmuneRACE study to prospectively collect samples from individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, or who have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2. Discussion: We believe that the information contained within the genetics of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can improve our understanding of the immunobiology of this devasting virus and may inform efforts to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate scientific and clinical advancement in the fight against COVID-19, the TCR sequence data resulting from the primary aims of this study will be made publicly available to scientists and researchers across the globe, an effort made possible through a collaboration with Microsoft. Trial registration: ImmunoRACE is registered with the US National Institutes of Health and can be accessed at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04494893).","Dines, J. N.; Manley, T.

49,A DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE NEED FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION USING CHEST X-RAY IMAGES IN HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 PATIENTS,"Purpose: Early identification of a potentially deteriorating clinical course in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical since there exists a resource-demand gap for the ventilators. Materials: We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based approach to predict the need for mechanical ventilation as early as at the time of initial radiographic evaluation. We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images derived from 528 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for purpose of validation. Results: We found that our deep learning model predicted the need for ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately three days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24-13.25%. Conclusion: Our deep learning model accurately predicted the need for mechanical ventilation early during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. Until effective preventive or treatment measures become widely available for COVID-19 patients, prognostic stratification as provided by our model is likely to be highly valuable.","Kulkarni, A.

Pregnant and puerperal women comprise the population most vulnerable to impacts on mental health. Objective: To synthesize the scientific evidence on the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women. Methods: systematic review focused on answering the question what is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnan and puerperal women?. In order to perform the search of the studies, we used combinations among the keywords: pregnan*, puerper*, prenatal, perinatal, mental health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. In total, we identified 150 studies from the databases and 14 studies were selected from preprints. We identified another four studies through manual search, totaling 18 studies to compose the final sample of this review. Results: Anxiety and depression were the main outcomes found, being shown in 15 and 11 studies, respectively. Other outcomes found in more than one study were: concerns related to several factors, loneliness, stress and fear. Conclusion: From this review, we can infer that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of pregnant and puerperal women, with depression and anxiety being the most frequent changes. The social detachment, the media pressure, the fear of contracting the infection, the economic scenario and the rupture of family rituals are shown as intensifying factors of psychological distress, thus causing changes in the mental health of these women.","Vieira, L.

52,First study on surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater systems and related environments in Wuhan: Post-lockdown,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as an effective environmental surveillance tool in monitoring fecal-oral pathogen infections within a community. Congruently, SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tissues, and be shed in feces. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater, sludge, surface water, ground water, and soil samples of municipal and hospital wastewater systems and related environment in Wuhan during the COVID-19 middle and low risk periods, and the viral RNA copies quantified using RT-qPCR. From the findings of this study, during the middle risk period, one influent sample and three secondary treatment effluents collected from Waste Water Treatment Plant 2 (WWTP2), as well as two influent samples from wastewater system of Hospital 2 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. One sludge sample collected from Hospital 4; which was obtained during low risk period, was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These study findings demonstrate the significance of WBE in continuous surveilling and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level, even when the COVID19 prevalence is low. Therefore, the application of WBE is principally useful in tracking the level of infections in communities and the risk assessment of the secondary environment.","Zhao, L.; Atoni, E.; Du, Y.; Zhang, H.; Donde, O.; Huang, D.; Xiao, S.; Ma, T.; Shu, Z.; Yuan, Z.; Tong, L.; Xia, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20172924v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20172924v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,True
53,"ESTIMATING CUMULATIVE COVID-19 INFECTIONS BY A NOVEL ""PANDEMIC RATE EQUATION""","A fundamental problem dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic has been to estimate the rate of infection, since so many cases are asymptomatic and contagious just for a few weeks. For example, in the US, estimate the proportion P(t) = N/330 where N is the US total who have ever been infected (in millions)at time t (months, t =0 being March 20). This is important for decisions on social restrictions, and allocation of medical resources, etc. However, the demand for extensive testing has not produced good estimates. In the US, the CDC has used the blood supply to sample for anti-bodies. Anti-bodies do not tell the whole picture, according to the Karolinska Instituet , many post infection cases show T-cell immunity, but no anti-bodies. We introduce a method based on a difference-differential equation (dde) for P(t). We emphasize that this is just for the present, with no prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The dde uses only x=x(s), which is the number/million testing positive, and y=y(s), the number/million who have been tested for all time 0 < s < t (months), with no assumptions on the dynamics of the pandemic. However, we need two parameters. First, R , the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected cases. Second, T , the period of active infection when the virus can be detected. Both are random variables with distribution which can be estimated. For fixed R, we prove uniform bounds (1+ R) x/(y +1) < P(t) < (1+ R) x(t) , are best possible, with range depending on T . One advantage of our theory is being able to estimate P for many regions and countries where x and y is the only information available.","Hamilton, D.

54,Comparisons of COVID-19 dynamics in the different countries of the World using Time-Series clustering,"In recent months, the world has suffered from the appearance of a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are great scientific efforts to find new treatments and vaccines, at the same time that governments, companies, and individuals have taken a series of actions in response to this pandemic. These efforts seek to decrease the speed of propagation, although with significant social and economic costs. Countries have taken different actions, also with different results. In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of the disease. It is concluded that the actions taken by the countries, the speed at which they were taken and the number of tests carried out may explain part of the differences in the dynamics of contagion.","Alvarez, E.; Brida, J.

55,Comprehensive Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Spread Using Wastewater-based Epidemiology Studies,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a devastating effect on human lives. Individuals who are symptomatic/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have/will have serious health complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control measure.","Manupati, H.; Kiran, U.; Kuncha, S. K.; Kopperi, H.; C.G., G.; S., V.

56,"The Prognostic Value of Eosinophil Recovery in COVID-19: A Multicentre, Retrospective Cohort Study on Patients Hospitalised in Spanish Hospitals.","Objectives: A decrease in blood cell counts, especially lymphocytes and eosinophils, has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), but there is no knowledge of the potential role of their recovery in these patients prognosis. This article aims to analyse the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Design: This work is a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study of 9,644 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Setting: This study examined patients hospitalised in 147 hospitals throughout Spain. Participants: This work analysed 9,644 patients (57.12% male) out of a cohort of 12,826 patients over 18 years of age hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry as of 29 May 2020. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure of this work is the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Univariate analysis was performed to determine possible predictors of death and then multivariate analysis was carried out to control for potential confounders. Results: An increase in the eosinophil count on the seventh day of hospitalisation was associated with a better prognosis, including lower mortality rates (5.2% vs 22.6% in non-recoverers, OR 0.234 [95% CI, 0.154 to 0.354]) and lower complication rates, especially regarding to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (8% vs 20.1%, p=0.000) and ICU admission (5.4% vs 10.8%, p=0.000). Lymphocyte recovery was found to have no effect on prognosis. Treatment with inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids was not found to be a confounding factor. Conclusion: Eosinophil recovery in patients with COVID-19 is a reliable marker of a good prognosis that is independent of prior treatment. This finding could be used to guide discharge decisions.","Mateos Gonzalez, M.; Sierra Gonzalo, E.; Casado Lopez, I.; Arnalich Fernandez, F.; Beato Perez, J. L.; Monge Monge, D.; Vargas Nunez, J.

Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes.

58,SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies provides insight into its genetic dynamics during infection,"A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first- to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as 'One-King'): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The 'One-King' model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","Sun, F.; Wang, X.; Tan, S.; Dan, Y.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Xu, J.; Tan, Z.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Zhang, W.; Chen, Y.; Tan, W.; Deng, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False

High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gorshkov, K.; Chen, C. Z.; de la Torre, J.

60,A Human-Immune-System mouse model for COVID-19 research(DRAGA mouse: HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2Rγc KO.NOD),"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates, and there is a compelling need for effective vaccines and therapeutic agents to lessen the severity of COVID-19 disease. Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R. gammac KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, T.-D.; Vir, P.; Shashikumar, S.; Karim, A.

The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally.

Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides a methodology for the generation of preventive and therapeutic antibody drugs for emerging infectious diseases.","Han, X.; Wang, Y.; Li, S.; Tang, N.; Hu, C.; Li, T.; Xie, Y.; Shen, M.; Wang, J.; Gu, C.; Hu, J.; Gong, F.; Wu, R.; Gao, F.; Huang, J.; Mu, S.; Luo, F.; Long, Y.; Song, S.; Long, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, Q.; Li, L.; Wu, Y.; Xu, W.; Cai, X.; Gao, Q.; Zhang, G.; He, C.; Wang, K.; Deng, K.; Du, L.; Nai, Y.; Wang, W.; Huang, A.; Jin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
64,"An effective, safe and cost-effective cell-based chimeric vaccine against SARS-CoV2","More than one hundred vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed and some of them have entered clinical trials, but the latest results revealed that these vaccines still face great challenges. Here, we developed a novel cell-based gp96-Ig-secreting chimeric vaccine which is composed of two viral antigens, the RBD of spike protein, and a truncated nucleocapsid protein that could induce epitope-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes but low antibody response. Syrian hamsters immunized with the cell-based vaccine produced high level of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs and specific T cell immunity which could eliminate RBD-truncated N-expressing cells, without the induction of antibody against N protein and other observed toxicity.

65,RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine BNT162b2 Selected for a Pivotal Efficacy Study,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have spread to millions of people globally. Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. Conclusion: These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.","Walsh, E. E.; Frenck, R.; Falsey, A.

67,Susceptibility of raccoon dogs for experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.","Freuling, C.

68,"Air pollution, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 outcomes: A state-of-the-science review of a rapidly evolving research area","Background: As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, 692,000 (August 7, 2020) human lives and counting have been lost worldwide to COVID-19. Understanding the relationship between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for developing solutions to this global crisis. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. Method: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria; we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional study design. Results: 27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes. Discussion: We discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability in testing, mitigation measures and pandemic stage, clustering of health outcomes, and a lack of publicly available data and code.","Bhaskar, A.; Chandra, J.; Braun, D.; Cellini, J.; Dominici, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175901v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,True
69,What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents? Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify mutation signatures and classify SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a Bag of Words (BoW) to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the distribution of the identified mutation signatures on the global map of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","Nagpal, S.; Srivastava, D.; Mande, S.

Objective. To quantify national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs in the US. Design. This is an observational study for which we obtained daily county level COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22, 2020 through the phased removal of social distancing protections. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT) analytical approach is used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Data include 3142 counties from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures. County-level NPIs were obtained from online county and state policy databases, then classified into four intervention levels: Level 1 (low), declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate), school closures, restricting nursing home access, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high), non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive). sheltering in place / stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. Additional county-level data were obtained to record racial (Black, Hispanic), economic (educational level, poverty), demographic (rural/urban) and climate factors (temperature, specific humidity, solar radiation). Main Outcomes. The primary outcomes are rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case doubling times. NPI effects are measured separately for nine US Census Region (Pacific, Mountain, West North Central, East North Central, West South Central, East South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England). Results. Aggressive NPIs (level 4) significantly reduced COVID-19 case and death rates in all US Census Regions, with effect sizes ranging from 4.1% to 25.7% and 5.5% to 25.5%, respectively, for each day they were active. No other intervention level achieved significance across all US Regions. Intervention levels 3 and 4 both increased COVID-19 doubling times, with effects peaking at 25 and 40 days after initiation of each policy, respectively. The effectiveness of level 3 NPIs varied, reducing case rates in all regions except North Central states, but associated with significantly higher death rates in all regions except Pacific states. Intervention levels 1 and 2 did not indicate any effect on COVID-19 propagation and, in some regions, these interventions were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Heterogeneity of NPI effects are associated with racial composition, poverty, urban-rural environment, and climate factors. Conclusion. Aggressive NPIs are effective tools to reduce COVID-19 propagation and mortality. Reducing social and environmental disparities may improve NPI effects in regions where less strict policies are in place.","Pan, W.; Tyrovolas, S.; Gine Vazquez, I.; Raj, R.; Fernandez, D.; Zaitchik, B.; Lantos, P.; Woods, C.

Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

73,Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

74,"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19, Prevalence of Pre-Existing Conditions, and Access to Essential Resources and Health Services in Somali IDP Camps","Background: Three million internally displaced Somalis live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities, and inaccessible health services. This vulnerable population is especially susceptible to COVID-19, which is expected to have worsened health outcomes and exacerbate existing structural challenges in the implementation of public health measures. This study examines knowledge of COVID-19, self-reported prevalence of preexisting conditions, and access to essential health services among residents of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Somalia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design assessing demographics, current health profiles, knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, and access to resources was used. 401 Somali IDP camp residents completed the survey. Results: Though 77% of respondents reported taking at least one COVID-19 preventative public health measure, respondents reported a severe lack of access to adequate sanitation, an inability to practice social distancing, and nearly universal inability to receive a COVID-19 screening exam. Questions assessing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 prevention and treatment yielded answers of ""I don't know"" for roughly 50% of responses. The majority were not familiar with basic information about the virus or confident that they could receive medical services if infected. Those who perceived their health status to be ""fair,"" as opposed to ""good,"" showed 5.69 times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19. Respondents who felt more anxious or nervous and those who introduced one behavioral change to protect against COVID-19 transmission showed 10.16 and 5.20 times increased odds of being concerned about disease contraction, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights immense gaps in the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 and access to treatment and preventative services among individuals living in Somali IDP camps. A massive influx of additional resources is required to adequately address COVID-19 in Somalia, starting with educating those individuals most vulnerable to infection.","Alawa, J.; Walz, L.

Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: All websites (n=27) selling direct to user home self-sampling and testing for COVID-19 (41 tests) in the UK (39 tests) and US (2 tests) identified by a website search on 23rd May 2020. Main outcome measures: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. Results: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32/41; 78%), when to use the test (10/41; 24%), test accuracy (12/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27/41 (66%) tests); we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values). For molecular virus tests, 9/23 (39%) websites explained that test positives should self-isolate, and 8/23 (35%) explained that test negatives may still have the disease. For antibody tests, 12/18 (67%) websites explained that testing positive does not necessarily infer immunity from future infection. Seven (39%) websites selling antibody tests claimed the test had a CE mark, when they were for a different intended use (venous blood rather than finger-prick samples). Conclusions: At the point of online purchase of home self-sampling COVID-19 tests, users in the UK are provided with incomplete, and in some cases misleading information on test accuracy, intended use and test interpretation.

77,Suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell response associated with the prominent HLA-A*02:01 phenotype,"An improved understanding of human T-cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 is important if we are to optimize therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T-cell memory to shared peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2. Following re-infection, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells enhance recovery and diminish clinical severity. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in vitro, with CD4+ sets being typically robust. For CD8+ T-cells taken directly ex vivo, we identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, A2/S269-277 and A2/Orf1ab3183-3191. Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of the A2/S269+CD8+ and A2/Orf1ab3183+CD8+ populations indicated that the more prominent A2/S269+CD8+ set was detected at comparable frequency (1.3x10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. But, while the numbers were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (2.5x10-6), they were low when compared with frequencies for influenza-specific (A2/M158) and EBV-specific (A2/BMLF1280) (1.38x10-4) populations. Phenotypic analysis ex vivo of A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents showed that A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells were predominantly negative for the CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T-cells were granzyme and/or perforin-positive. Furthermore, the bias towards naive, stem cell memory and central memory A2/S269+CD8+ T-cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T-cell activation. Priming with an appropriate vaccine may thus have great value for optimizing protective CD8+ T-cell immunity in COVID-19.","Habel, J. R.; Nguyen, T. H. O.; van de Sandt, C. E.; Juno, J.

78,Erythroid precursors and progenitors suppress adaptive immunity and get invaded by SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization. This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, S.; Xu, L.; Osman, M.; Sligl, W.; Shields, J.; Joyce, M.; Tyrrell, L.; Oyegbami, O.; Elahi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255927v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False
79,A Lymph Node Targeted Amphiphile Vaccine Induces Potent Cellular and Humoral Immunity to SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to public health, economic, and social consequences that mandate urgent development of effective vaccines to contain or eradicate infection. To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, M. P.; Seenappa, L.

80,Drug Repurposing Screen for Compounds Inhibiting the Cytopathic Effect of SARS-CoV-2,"Drug repurposing is a rapid approach to identifying therapeutics for the treatment of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. To address the urgent need for treatment options, we carried out a quantitative high-throughput screen using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic assay with a compound collection of 8,810 approved and investigational drugs, mechanism-based bioactive compounds, and natural products. Three hundred and nineteen compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were identified and confirmed, including 91 approved drug and 49 investigational drugs. Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported. Chlorprothixene, methotrimeprazine, and piperacetazine were the three most potent FDA approved drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These three compounds have not been previously reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, although their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus have been reported. These results demonstrate that this comprehensive data set of drug repurposing screen for SARS-CoV-2 is useful for drug repurposing efforts including design of new drug combinations for clinical trials.","Chen, C.

81,Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers,"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab')2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab')2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","Cunha, L.

82,In-depth blood proteome profiling analysis revealed distinct functional characteristics of plasma proteins between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over ten million patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor.

83,Bacterial modification of the host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modulates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization.

However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues. Our finding that IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under conditions approximating the in vivo situation shows that they may promote viral invasion during COVID-19.

88,Spike protein mutational landscape in India: Could Mullers ratchet be a future game-changer for COVID-19?,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

SignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, R.; Basak, K.; Ghosh, A.; Rajachandran, V.; Sureka, K.; Ganguly, D.; Chattopadhyay, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

We utilize, genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries regional information such as deaths and cases per million as well as covid-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.","Oulas, A.; Zanti, M.; Tomazou, M.; Zachariou, M.; Minadakis, G.; Bourdakou, M.

Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V.

91,"SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b Antagonizes Type I and III Interferons by Targeting Multiple Components of RIG-I/MDA-5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, and cGAS-STING Signaling Pathways","Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a catastrophic effect on human health and society. Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, L.; Zhuang, M.-W.; Zheng, Y.; Zhang, J.; Nan, M.-L.; Wang, P.-H.; Gao, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.252973v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
92,A lesson from COVID-19 on inaccessibility of web-based information for disabled populations worldwide,"Many government websites and mobile content are inaccessible for people with vision, hearing, and cognitive disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these disparities when health authority website information, critical in providing resources for curbing the spread of the virus, remained inaccessible for disabled populations. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provide comparatively universally accepted guidelines for website accessibility. We utilized these parameters to examine the number of countries with or without accessible health authority websites. The resulting data indicate a dearth of countries with websites accessible for persons with disabilities. Methods of information dissemination must take into consideration individuals with disabilities, particularly in times of global health crises.","Dror, A.

93,"SARS-Cov-2-, HIV-1-, Ebola-neutralizing and anti-PD1 clones are predisposed","Antibody repertoire refers to the totality of the superbly diversified antibodies within an individual to cope with the vast array of possible pathogens. Despite this extreme diversity, antibodies of the same clonotype, namely public clones, have been discovered among individuals. Although some public clones could be explained by antibody convergence, public clones in naive repertoire or virus-neutralizing clones from not infected people were also discovered. All these findings indicated that public clones might not occur by random and they might exert essential functions. However, the frequencies and functions of public clones in a population have never been studied. Here, we integrated 2,449 Rep-seq datasets from 767 donors and discovered 5.07 million public clones - ~10% of the repertoire are public in population. We found 38 therapeutic clones out of 3,390 annotated public clones including anti-PD1 clones in healthy people. Moreover, we also revealed clones neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV-1 viruses in healthy individuals. Our result demonstrated that these clones are predisposed in the human antibody repertoire and may exert critical functions during particular immunological stimuli and consequently benefit the donors. We also implemented RAPID - a Rep-seq Analysis Platform with Integrated Databases, which may serve as a useful tool for others in the field.","Zhang, Y.; Xu, Q.; Zeng, H.; Wang, M.; Zhang, Y.; Lan, C.; Yang, X.; Zhu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Wang, Q.; Tang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Wu, J.; Wang, C.; Xie, W.; Ma, C.; Guan, J.; Guo, S.; Chen, S.; Chang, C.; Yang, W.; Wei, L.; Ren, J.; Yu, X.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.249086v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.249086v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
94,A SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody protects from lung pathology in a COVID-19 hamster model,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 [A] revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, weight loss and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising therapeutic strategy.","Kreye, J.; Reincke, S.

Here we use the power of these predicted models to assess the sequence diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 proteomes in the context of an individuals CD8 T-cell immune repertoire to identify potential. defined regions of immunogenicity. Using this approach of expedited and rational CD8 T-cell vaccine design, it may be possible to develop a therapeutic vaccine candidate with the potential for both global and local coverage.","Hare, J.; Morrison, D.; Nielsen, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.250647v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.250647v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,False
96,Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, D.

97,High titers of multiple antibody isotypes against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and nucleoprotein associate with better neutralization.,"Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, M.

99,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations on Protein Structures and Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions,"Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, S.; Tian, C.; Liu, P.; Guo, D.; Zheng, W.; Huang, X.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,False
