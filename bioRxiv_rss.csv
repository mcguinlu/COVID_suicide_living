0,SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control in a hospital setting: an individual-based modelling study,"Background: Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of COVID-19 is now a top global public health priority. We sought to assess strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation, tracing and quarantine, wearing facial masks/ personal protective equipment. Methods: We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan in a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. Results: We estimated that work-related stress increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers by 52% (90% Credible Interval (CrI): 16.4% - 93.0%). The use of high efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% CrI: 73.1% - 85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0% - 92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. A strict quarantine policy with the isolation of symptomatic cases and a high fraction of pre-symptomatic/ asymptomatic cases (via contact tracing or high test rate), could only prolong outbreak duration with minimal impact on the outbreak size. Our results indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures.","Huang, Q.; Mondal, A.; Jiang, X.; Horn, M.

1,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in hospitalized patients in a tertiary referral center in North India,"Background: Seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is an important tool to estimate the true extent of infection in a population. However, seroprevalence studies have been scarce in South East Asia including India, which, as of now, carries the third largest burden of confirmed cases in the world. The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody among hospitalized patients at one of the largest government hospital in India. Method: This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, recruited consecutive patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or CB-NAAT. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels targeting recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS CoV-2 were estimated in serum samples by the ELISA method. Results: A total of 212 hospitalized patients were recruited in the study with mean age (+/-SD) of 41.2 (+/-15.4) years and 55% male population. Positive serology against SARS CoV-2 was detected in 19.8% patients(95% CI 14.7-25.8). Residency in Delhi conferred a higher frequency of seropositivity 26.5% (95% CI 19.3-34.7) as compared to that of other states 8% (95% CI 3.0-16.4) with p-value 0.001. No particular age groups or socio-economic strata showed a higher proportion of seropositivity. Conclusion: Around, one-fifth of hospitalized patients, who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 before, demonstrated seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2. While there was no significant difference in the different age groups and socio-economic classes; residence in Delhi was associated with increased risk (relative risk of 3.62, 95% CI 1.59-8.21) Key Words: SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody, Seroprevalence, Hospitalized patient, COVID-19","Ray, A.; Singh, K.; Chattopadhyay, S.; Mehdi, F.; Batra, G.; Gupta, A.; Agarwal, A.; M, B.; Sahni, S.; R, C.; Agarwal, S.; Nagpal, C.; B H, G.; Arora, U.; Sharma, K.

2,ANALYSIS OF SARS-COV-2 GENOME SEQUENCES FROM THE PHILIPPINES: GENETIC SURVEILLANCE AND TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS,"The spread of the corona virus around the world has spurred travel restrictions and community lockdowns to manage the transmission of infection. In the Philippines, with a large population of overseas Filipino contract workers (OFWs), as well as foreign workers in the local online gaming industry and visitors from nearby countries, the first reported cases were from a Chinese couple visiting the country in mid-January 2020. Three months on, by mid-March, the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines had reached its first 100, before it exploded to the present 178,022 cases (as of August 20, 2020). Here, we report a genomic survey of six (6) whole genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus collected from COVID-19 patients seen at the Philippine General Hospital, the major referral hospital for COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila at about the time the Philippines had over a hundred cases. Analysis of commonly observed variants did not reveal a clear pattern of the virus evolving towards a more infectious and severe strain. When combined with other available viral sequences from the Philippines and from GISAID, phylogenomic analysis reveal that the sequenced Philippine isolates can be classified into three primary groups based on collection dates and possible infection sources: (1) January samples collected in the early phases of the pandemic that are closely associated with isolates from Wuhan, China; (2) March samples that are mainly linked to the M/V Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak; and (3) June samples that clustered with European isolates, one of which already harbor the globally prevalent D614G mutation which initially circulated in Europe. The presence of community-acquired viral transmission amidst compulsory and strict quarantine protocols, particularly for repatriated Filipino workers, highlights the need for a refinement of the quarantine, testing, and tracing strategies currently being implemented to adapt to the current pandemic situation.","Tablizo, F.

3,The analysis of the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular immune system in individuals recovering from COVID-19 reveals a profound NKT cell impairment,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects millions of people and killed hundred-thousands of individuals. While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation. Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.","liu, j.; Yang, X.; Wang, H.; Li, Z.; Deng, H.; jing, L.; Xiong, S.; He, J.; Guo, C.; Wang, W.; Zelinskyy, G.; Trilling, M.; Dittmer, U.; Lu, M.; Sutter, K.; Senff, T.; Menne, C.; Timm, J.; Zhang, Y.; Deng, F.; Feng, X.; Lu, Y.; Wu, J.; Yang, D.; Wang, B.; Zheng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
4,"COVID-19: Estimation of the Actual Onset of Local Epidemic Cycles, Determination of Total Number of Infective, and Duration of the Incubation Period","Background: Most studies of the epidemic cycles of the pandemic of Sars-CoV-2, or COVID-19 as it became known, define the beginning of specific cycles in countries from the laboratory identification of the first cases of infection, however, there is the awareness that cycles may have started earlier, without proper identification. This influences all the parameters that govern the statistical models used for controlling the infection. Purpose: This work proposes two models based on experimental data. The Logistic Model it is used to obtain three parameters of the epidemic cycle of COVID-19, namely: the final count for the total infected, the daily infection rate and the lag time. Complimentary, a novel inventory model is proposed to calculate the number of infective persons, as well as to determine the incubation period. Methods: The data on epidemic cycles of Germany, Italy, and Sweden are treated previously by the Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI), then a variation of the Logistic Model, obtained through curve-fitting, is used to obtain the three parameters. The inventory model is introduced to calculate the actual number of infected persons and the behavior of the incubation period is analyzed. Results: After comparing data from the three countries it is possible to determine the actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles for each one, determine the size of the incubation period, as well as to determine the total number of infective persons during the cycle. Conclusions: The actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles in the countries analyzed are determined, the total number of infected is determined, and it is statistically proven that the incubation cycle for Sars-CoV-2 is five days.","De Carvalho, R.

5,Mask Wearing and Control of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in the United States,"Introduction: Cloth face coverings and surgical masks have become commonplace across the United States in response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. While evidence suggests masks help curb the spread of respiratory pathogens, research is limited. Face masks have quickly become a topic of public debate as government mandates have started requiring their use. Here we investigate the association between self-reported mask wearing, social distancing and community SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States, as well as the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. Methods: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered June 3 through July 31, 2020 via web platform. Surveys queried individuals' likelihood to wear a face mask to the grocery store or with family and friends. Responses (N=378,207) were aggregated by week and state and combined with measures of the instantaneous reproductive number (Rt), social distancing proxies, respondent demographics and other potential sources of confounding. We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (Rt <1) for each state and week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were considered to corroborate findings across mask wearing definitions, Rt estimators and data sources. Additionally, mask wearing in 12 states was evaluated two weeks before and after statewide mandates. Results: We find an upward trend in mask usage across the U.S., although uptake varies by geography and demographic groups. A multivariate logistic model controlling for social distancing and other variables found a 10% increase in mask wearing was associated with a 3.53 (95% CI: 2.03, 6.43) odds of transmission control (Rt <1). We also find that communities with high mask wearing and social distancing have the highest predicted probability of a controlled epidemic. These positive associations were maintained across sensitivity analyses. Segmented regression analysis of mask wearing found no statistical change following mandates, however the positive trend of increased mask wearing over time was preserved. Conclusion: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.","Rader, B.; White, L.

Formulation of a ""Protected"" population P, which can be viewed as a ""Sheltered in Place"", unexposed population which, starting at time t = Tau_P, builds up and stores a reservoir of unexposed Population; 2. This ""Protection Intervention"" provides the basis for a second, ""Timed Release"" Intervention: on receiving a ""reopening signal"" at time t = tau_R$, this second intervention initiates a release of the stored population P back into the general population S. 3. Selection of model parameters to ""optimize"" the approximation of the model up to the present, and then projecting simulation of the model based on the value thus obtained 100,200, 365, and 730 days into the future.

7,Epidemiologically most successful SARS-CoV-2 variant: concurrent mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein,"The D614G mutation of the Spike protein is thought to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Ilmjärv, S.; Abdul, F.; Acosta-Gutierrez, S.; Estarellas, C.; Galdadas, I.; Casimir, M.; Alessandrini, M.; Gervasio, F.

8,SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cells frequency in recovered patient remains stable while antibodies decay over time,"The breadth of the humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection was indicated to be important for recovery from COVID-19. Recent studies have provided valuable insights regarding the dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, the information regarding the dynamics of the serological and cellular memory in COVID-19 recovered patients in scarce. It is imperative to determine the persistence of humoral memory in COVID-19 recovered patients as it will help to evaluate the susceptibility of recovered patients to re-infection. Here, we describe the dynamics of both the SARS-CoV-2 specific serological and B cell response in COVID-19 recovered patients. We found that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients mount a robust antibody response following infection however, the serological memory decays in recovered patients over the period of 6 months. On the other hand, the B cell response as observed in the SARS-CoV-2 specific memory B cell compartment, was found to be stable over time. Moreover, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell plasmablasts was found to be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels. These data, suggests that the differentiation of short-lived plasmablasts to become long-lived plasma cells is impaired and the main contributor of antibody production are the short-lived plasmablasts. Overall, our data provides insights regarding the humoral memory persistence in recovered COVID-19 patients. Notwithstanding the insights from this study, it is still to be determined if the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells can be considered as a correlate of protection in the absence of serological memory.","Vaisman-Mentesh, A.; Dror, Y.; Tur-Kaspa, R.; Markovitch, D.; Kournos, T.; Dicker, D.; Wine, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179796v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179796v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
9,Declining SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity with time and dependence on clinical features: consequences for control,"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on upper respiratory tract (URT) samples is the primary method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections and guide public health measures, with a supportive role for serology. However, the clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR remains uncertain. In the present study, Bayesian statistical modeling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 79-95%; while increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases. Negative URT RT-PCR results should therefore be interpreted in the context of clinical characteristics, especially with regard to containment of viral transmission based on the 'test, trace and isolate' principle.","Bergmans, B.

10,"Impacts of K-12 school reopening on the COVID-19 epidemic in Indiana, USA","Importance: In the United States, schools closed in March 2020 to reduce the burden of COVID-19. They are now reopening amid high incidence in many places, necessitating analyses of the associated risks and benefits. Objective: To determine the impact of school reopening with varying levels of operating capacity and face-mask adherence on COVID-19 burden. Design: Modeling study using an agent-based model that simulates daily activities of the population. Transmission can occur in places such as schools, workplaces, community, and households. Model parameters were calibrated to and validated against multiple types of COVID-19 data. Setting: Indiana, United States of America. Participants: Synthetic population of Indiana. K-12 students, teachers, their families, and others in the state were studied separately. Interventions: Reopening of schools under three levels of school operating capacity (50%, 75%, and 100%), as well as three assumptions about face-mask adherence in schools (50%, 75%, and 100%). We compared the impact of these scenarios to reopening at full capacity without face masks and a scenario with schools operating remotely, for a total of 11 scenarios. Main outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic cases, and deaths due to COVID-19 from August 24 to December 31. Results: We projected 19,527 (95% CrI: 4,641-56,502) infections and 360 (95% CrI: 67-967) deaths in the scenario where schools operated remotely from August 24 to December 31. Reopening at full capacity with low face-mask adherence in schools resulted in a proportional increase of 81.7 (95% CrI: 78.2-85.3) times the number of infections and 13.4 (95% CrI: 12.8-14.0) times the number of deaths. High face-mask adherence resulted in a proportional increase of 3.0 (95% CrI: 2.8-3.1) times the number of infections. Operating at reduced capacity with high face-mask adherence resulted in only an 11.6% (95% CrI: 5.50%-17.9%) increase in the number of infections. Conclusions and Relevance: Reduced capacity and high face-mask adherence in schools would substantially reduce the burden of COVID-19 in schools and across the state. We did not explore the impact of other reopening scenarios, such as alternating days of attendance. Heterogeneous decisions could be made across different districts throughout the state, which our model does not capture. Hence, caution should be taken in interpreting our results as specific quantitative targets for operating capacity or face-mask adherence. Rather, our results suggest that schools should give serious consideration to reducing capacity as much as is feasible and enforcing adherence to wearing face masks.","Espana, G.; Cavany, S.; Oidtman, R.

11,Monitoring COVID-19 transmission risks by RT-PCR tracing of droplets in hospital and living environments,"SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination occurs through droplets and biological fluids released in the surroundings from patients or asymptomatic carriers. Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of COVID-19. We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex RT-PCR on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S-amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swab) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (3 hospitals and 3 public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID-hospital, but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplets traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions and faecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by RT-PCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for Coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment.","Piana, A.; Colucci, M.

12,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in children: accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate.,"The tests currently used for the direct identification of SARS-CoV-2 include specimens taken from upper and lower respiratory tract; recommendations from Word Health Organization prioritise nasopharyngeal swab (NS). In literature there are not available paediatric studies about the identification of SARS-CoV-2 through nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), but the use of NPA is deemed to be better than NS to identify respiratory viruses in children. The aim of our study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of NS compared to NPA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([&ge;] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","Di Pietro, G.

Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and ML. A total of 128 qualified articles were reviewed and analyzed based on the study objectives. Results: The 128 publications selected were classified into three themes based on ML applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology (CE), Early Detection and Diagnosis (EDD), and Disease Progression (DP). Of the 128 studies, 70 focused on predicting the outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were grouped into the CE theme. For the EDD, we grouped forty studies that applied ML techniques to detect the presence of COVID-19 using the patient's radiological images or lab results. Eighteen publications that focused on predicting the disease progression, outcomes (recovery and mortality), Length of Stay (LOS), and number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days for COVID-19 positive patients were classified under the DP theme. Conclusions: In this systematic review, we assembled the current COVID-19 literature that utilized ML methods to provide insights into the COVID-19 themes, highlighting the important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research.","Syeda, H.

14,The Relationship between Deteriorating Mental Health Conditions and Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Usages among College Students in the United States during COVID-19: Observational Study,"Background: Mental health problems among the global population are worsened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Yet, current methods for screening mental health issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, blocked by social stigmas and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in mental health profiles of users through a non-invasive manner. Objective: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. Methods: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental health profiles in terms of these features. Results: Of the 49 participants, 41% (n=20) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the PHQ-9 score > 5) in depression, denoted as DEP; 45% (n=22) of them reported a significant increase (increase in the GAD-7 score > 5) in anxiety, denoted as ANX. Of the 5 features proposed to quantify online behavior changes, statistical significances were found between the DEP and non-DEP groups for all of them (P<.01, effect sizes eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.130 to 0.320); statistical significances were found between the ANX and non-ANX groups for 4 of them (P<.02, effect sizes eta_{partial}^2 ranging between 0.115 to 0.231). Significant features included late-night online activities, continuous usages and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Conclusions: The results suggested strong discrepancies between college student groups with and without deteriorating mental health conditions in terms of behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube usages during the COVID-19. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zaman, A.; Zhang, B.; Hoque, E.; Silenzio, V.; Kautz, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20178640v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20178640v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
15,SARS-CoV-2 infections and antibody responses among health care workers in a Spanish hospital after a month of follow-up,"Background. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%. Methods. A follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and/or antibody seropositivity. Results. The cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565) for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups. The decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","Moncunill, G.; Mayor, A.; Santano, R.; Jimenez, A.; Vidal, M.; Tortajada, M.; Sanz, S.; Mendez, S.; Llupia, A.; Aguilar, R.; Alonso, S.; Barrios, D.; Carolis, C.; Cistero, P.; Choliz, E.; Cruz, A.; Fochs, S.; Jairoce, C.; Hecht, J.; Lamoglia, M.; Martinez, M.; Moreno, J.; Mitchell, R.; Ortega, N.; Pey, N.; Puyol, L.; Ribes, M.; Rosell, N.; Sotomayor, P.; Torres, S.; Williams, S.; Barroso, S.; Vilella, A.; Trilla, A.; Varela, P.; Dobano, C.; Garcia-Basteiro, A.

16,Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines Under Limited Supply,"This paper considers how to allocate Covid-19 vaccines to different age groups when limited vaccines are available over time. The disease dynamics is specified by an age-structured SAPHIRE model whose parameters are estimated by the standard least square method using the epidemic data from New York City. We derive optimal static allocation policies with different objectives under different amounts of daily available vaccines, and examine several dynamic allocation heuristics including old-first policy, infection-first policy, myopic policy, death-weighted myopic policy, and two-day myopic policy. For static policies, our numerical study shows that to minimize the total deaths, it is optimal to allocate limited vaccines to the oldest group first and then the younger group if there are capacities remaining. In contrast, to minimize the total confirmed cases, the optimal static policy allocates a considerable portion of vaccines to younger groups even if the daily available vaccines are very limited. The optimal static policies achieve a much smaller number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to two benchmark policies: a uniform allocation policy that allocates available vaccines equally to each age group, and a proportional allocation policy that allocates available vaccines proportionally to the population of each age group. For dynamic allocation policies, the myopic policy and the two-day myopic policy have similar performance and significantly outperforms the other dynamic heuristics and the static policies in terms of the confirmed cases and deaths.","Chen, X.; Li, M.; Simchi-Levi, D.; Zhao, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179820v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179820v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
17,Projecting COVID-19 disease severity in cancer patients using purposefully-designed machine learning,"Background: Accurately predicting outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19 has been clinically challenging. Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. Methods: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 354 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using clinical variables only collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). Results: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an AUROC ranging from 70-85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables -- including patient demographics, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type -- suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. Conclusions: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.","Navlakha, S.; Morjaria, S.; Perez-Johnston, R.; Zhang, A.; Taur, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179838v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179838v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True

20,"Therapeutic Prospects for Th-17 Cell Immune Storm Syndrome and Neurological Symptoms in COVID-19: Thiamine Efficacy and Safety, In-vitro Evidence and Pharmacokinetic Profile","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg/day equivalent (0.01 ug/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. Further studies using thiamine as an interventional/prevention strategy in severe COVID-19 patients could identify its precise anti-inflammatory role.","Vatsalya, V.; Li, F.; Frimodig, J.

21,Role of interfering substances in the survival of coronaviruses on surfaces and their impact on the efficiency of hand and surface disinfection,"Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for hospital-acquired viral infections. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of interfering substances on SARS-CoV-2 surface stability and virucidal efficiency of hand sanitizers and surface disinfectant. To this end, surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 was measured on stainless steel in different experimental conditions, with or without an artificial mucus/saliva mixture and compared against that of human coronavirus HCoV-229E and feline coronavirus FCoV. The impact of the mucus/saliva mixture on the virucidal efficiency of 3 commercial alcohol hand sanitizers and 1 surface chemical disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and FCoV was then measured. Our results indicate that mucus/saliva mixture did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on the surface survival of tested viruses, with temperature being an important parameter. In addition, we demonstrated that interfering substances may play an important role in the virucidal efficacy of hand sanitizers and disinfectants, highlighting the need for adapted testing protocols that better reflect current - real life -conditions of use.","Szpiro, L.; Pizzorno, A.; Durimel, L.; Julien, T.; Traversier, A.; Bouchami, D.; Marie, Y.; Rosa-Calatrava, M.; Terrier, O.; Moules, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
22,Evaluation of the current therapeutic approaches for COVID-19: a meta-analysis,"Background and rationale: Limited data on the efficacy and safety of currently applied COVID-19 therapeutics and their impact on COVID-19 outcomes have raised additional concern. Aim and Methods: We estimated the impact of the current treatments on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 by a meta-analysis. The comprehensive search included studies reporting clinical features and treatment strategies published from January 21, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Results: We included 52 studies that involved 13,966 COVID-19 patients. We found that the most prevalent treatments were antivirals (proportion: 0.74, 95% CI : [0.65, 0.83]) and antibiotics (proportion: 0.73, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.83]). The COVID-19 severity increased among patients taking glucocorticoids (risk ratio (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.76]) or immunoglobulins (RR = 3.83, 95% CI: [1.27, 11.53]), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) and glucocorticoids increased the length of ICU stay (RRT : RR= 11.89, 95% CI: [3.26, 43.39]; glucocorticoids: RR = 3.10, 95% CI: [1.52, 6.29]). The COVID-19 severity and mortality increased among patients taking tocilizumab (severity: F = 25.53, P = 0.02; mortality: F = 19.37, P = 0.02). The most effective treatment was the combination of arbidol with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with placebo (mean difference = 0.5, 95% CI [-0.60, 1.66]), and the safest combination was remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir (RR= 0.78, 95% CI [0.32, 1.91]). Conclusion: glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, RRT, and tocilizumab might worsen COVID-19 outcomes, and the most effective and safest treatment strategy for COVID-19 is the combination of different antivirals.","Abdelrahman, Z.; Liu, Q.; Jiang, S.; Li, M.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180638v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180638v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
23,Wastewater sample site selection to estimate geographically-resolved community prevalence of COVID-19: A research protocol,"Background: Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States.","Yeager, R.

24,COVID-19 is associated with relative ADAMTS13 deficiency and VWF multimer formation resembling TTP,"Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, A. A.

26,Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of outpatients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19: A multi-center observational study,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has not been associated with improved survival among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the majority of observational studies and similarly was not identified as an effective prophylaxis following exposure in a prospective randomized trial. We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","Ip, A.; Ahn, J.; Zhou, Y.; Goy, A. H.; Hansen, E.; Pecora, A. L.; Sinclaire, B.

27,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","Lemieux, J.; Siddle, K.

28,FLOW CYTOMETRY MULTIPLEXED METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF NEUTRALIZING HUMAN ANTIBODIES TO THE NATIVE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN,"A correct identification of seropositive individuals for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is of paramount relevance to assess the degree of protection of a human population to present and future outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe here a sensitive and quantitative flow cytometry method using the cytometer-friendly non-adherent Jurkat T cell line that stably expresses the full-length native spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a truncated form of the human EGFR that serves a normalizing role. S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self-cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti-S immunoglobulins by calculating a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensities obtained by double- staining with the sera and a monoclonal antibody specific for EGFR. We show that the method allows to detect immune individuals regardless of the result of other serological tests or even repeated PCR monitoring. It can also be employed to detect neutralizing activity in the sera of individuals. Finally, the method can be used in a multiplexed format to simultaneously measure all anti-S human immunoglobulin isotypes in blood and mucosal fluids including total saliva.","Horndler, L.; Delgado, P.; Balabanov, I.; Cornish, G.; Llamas, M.

29,Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa: Phylogenetic and mutation analysis study,"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is the subject of an immune selective pressure which increases the variability in such region. This study aimed to identify mutations in the S gene among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focusing on the D614G mutation, that has a presumed fitness advantage. Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year based on large clusters' Bayesian analyses. The D614G mutation appeared to be taking over the COVID-19 infections in the MENA. Bayesian analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have been circulating in MENA earlier than previously reported.","Sallam, M.; Ababneh, N.; Dababseh, D.; Bakri, F.; Mahafzah, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20176792v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20176792v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
30,Suitability of Google Trends ™ for digital surveillance during ongoing COVID-19 epidemic: a case study from India,"Background: India went into the largest population-level lockdown on 25th March 2020 in response to the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Digital surveillance has been shown to be useful to supplement the traditional surveillance. Google Trends  (GT) is one such platform reported to be useful during pandemics of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India. Google searches in India during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reflects mostly curiosity and apprehension of citizens. GT can also complement traditional surveillance in India as well as high burden states.","Satpathy, P.

We conducted a global survey in June 2020 of 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine potential acceptance rates of a COVID-19 vaccine and factors influencing acceptance. We ran univariate logistic regressions to examine the associations with demographic variables. 71.5% reported they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine; 61.4% reported they would accept their employer's recommendation to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Differences in acceptance across countries ranged from almost 9 in 10 (China) to fewer than 6 in 10 (Russia). Respondents reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were more likely to accept a vaccine, and take their employer's advice to do so. Targeted interventions addressing age, sex, income, and education level are required to increase and sustain public acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Lazarus, J.

32,A deterministic linear infection model to inform Risk-Cost-Benefit Analysis of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Risk-cost-benefit analysis requires the enumeration of decision alternatives, their associated outcomes, and the quantification of uncertainty. Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, J.

33,Teamwork in the manufacturing workplace may hinder social distance,"The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections show no signs of stopping. Therefore, if the era of With-Colona will continue for a while, we must consider how to deal with this disaster well. The practice of social distance is one of the powerful tools for that purpose. In previous research, analysis of the factors that influence social distance has also been carried out using information from the US occupation information site O*NET. However, they targeted all industries, not specific industries. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the factors that influence Physical Proximity in the manufacturing industry, which has a large impact on the economy given the scale of employment. As the method, first, exploratory factor analysis is performed using O*NET information, and the extracted 7 variables, Sitting Work, Adverse Conditions, Information Processing, Bridging Work, Teamwork, Response to Aggression, and Intelligent Work, are used in the regression analysis. As a result, it was shown that Teamwork is the biggest factor that influences Physical Proximity. Also, Adverse Conditions and Response to Aggression showed a positive correlation and Sitting Work showed a negative correlation.

34,3D Printed N95 Equivalent for PPE Shortages: The Kansas City Mask,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was well-reported and discussed, not only in the healthcare sector but across all of society as the demands for PPE skyrocketed. As hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness continue to increase, many recent reports indicate the supply of PPE is persistently and significantly less than the demand. These PPE shortages encouraged communities of 3D printing experts and hobbyists to design and distribute homemade, 3D-printed PPE, including N95 mask substitutes. The mask presented, the Kansas City Mask (KC Mask), is one such product which was created from the maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This report discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the KC Mask design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods: The KC Mask was adapted from a similar design called the Montana Mask. Mask components were 3D printed and assembled then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, MO as a proof of concept. Results: The QLFT was successful and the KC Mask was approved for use by pandemic response administration staff at the hospital. Fortunately, the KC Mask has not required wide utilization, however, because supply chains for Kansas City area hospitals have, at the time of this publication, not yet been exhausted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The results of Truman Medical Center approval of the KC Mask are promising for this N95 stop-gap substitute. Although further analysis and study is needed for this design, persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitate an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for the KC Mask as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse the KC Mask as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage based on CDC guidelines.","Dalla, S.; Bacon, B.; Ayres, J.

35,An examination of COVID-19 mitigation efficiency among 23 countries,"The purpose of this paper is to compare the relative mitigation efficiency of COVID-19 transmission among 23 selected countries, including 19 countries in the G20, two heavily infected countries (Iran and Spain), and two highly populous countries (Pakistan and Nigeria). This paper evaluated the mitigation efficiency for each country at each stage by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) tools and analyzed changes in mitigation efficiency across stages. Pearson correlation tests were conducted between each change to examine the impact of efficiency ranks in the previous stage on subsequent stages. An indicator was developed to judge epidemic stability and was applied to practical cases involving lifting travel restrictions and restarting the economy in some countries. The results showed that Korea and Australia performed with the highest efficiency in preventing the diffusion of COVID-19 for the whole period covering 120 days since the first confirmed case, while the USA ranked at the bottom. China, Japan, Korea and Australia were judged to have recovered from the attack of COVID-19 due to higher epidemic stability.","Chen, Y.-T.; Yu, S.-H.; Su, E.

36,The health sector cost of different policy responses to COVID-19 in low- and middle- income countries,"Much attention has focussed in recent months on the impact that COVID-19 has on health sector capacity, including critical care bed capacity and resources such as personal protective equipment. However, much less attention has focussed on the overall cost to health sectors, including the full human resource costs and the health system costs to address the pandemic. Here we present estimates of the total costs of COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries for different scenarios of COVID-19 mitigation over a one year period. We find costs vary substantially by setting, but in some settings even mitigation scenarios place a substantial fiscal impact on the health system. We conclude that the choices facing many low- and middle- income countries, without further rapid emergency financial support, are stark, between fully funding an effective COVID-19 reponse or other core essential health services.","Torres Rueda, S.; Sweeney, S.; Bozzani, F.; Vassall, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20180299v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20180299v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True

38,Dynamics of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein drives dsRNA melting in a counterintuitive tweezer-like mechanism,"The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs' Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.","Caruso, I.

We designed a series of peptides mimicking the N-terminal helix of hACE2 protein which contains most of the contacting residues at the binding site and have a high helical folding propensity in aqueous solution. Our best peptide mimics bind to the virus spike protein with high affinity and are able to block SARS-CoV-2 human pulmonary cell infection with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range.

40,The inhaled steroid ciclesonide blocks SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by targeting viral replication-transcription complex in culture cells,"We screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and MERS-CoV replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Matsuyama, S.; Kawase, M.; Nao, N.; Shirato, K.; Ujike, M.; Kamitani, W.; Shimojima, M.; Fukushi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
41,A negative feedback model to explain regulation of SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription,"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been preliminarily revealed recently, their regulation is still unclear. Results: By reanalysis of public data, we proposed a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription of, but not limited to coronavirus (CoVs). The key step leading to new discoveries is that we identified the cleavage sites of nps15, an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) or genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleavage of transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs. The increase of nsp15 results in the decrease of itself to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs. Conclusions: The replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback strategy. This is a basic mechanism to influence the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our study indicates that nsp15 is an important and ideal target for drug development against CoVs.","Shan, G.; Zhi, C.; Xiufeng, J.; Fang, W.; Yibo, X.; Hao, Z.; Chang, L.; Jishou, R.; Guangyou, D.; Xin, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False

We show that hamsters treated with a high dose of human convalescent plasma or a monoclonal antibody were protected against weight loss showing reduced pneumonia and pulmonary virus replication compared to control animals. However, a ten-fold lower dose of convalescent plasma showed no protective effect. Thus, variable and relatively low levels of virus neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma may limit their use for effective antiviral therapy, favouring concentrated, purified (monoclonal) antibodies.","Haagmans, B.

43,Antiviral activity of lambda-carrageenan against influenza viruses in mice and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro,"Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan ({lambda}-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with EC50 values ranging from 0.3-1.4 g/ml. No toxicity to host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 g/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that {lambda}-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing entry. Moreover, intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, {lambda}-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection by several respiratory viruses.","Jang, Y. J.; Shin, H.; Lee, M. K.; Kwon, O. S.; Shin, J.

44,Impaired cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response in elderly COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a T cell response that most likely contributes to virus control in COVID-19 patients, but may also induce immunopathology. Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients.

Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.

ImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group in comparison to younger patients.","Westmeier, J.; Paniskaki, K.; Karaköse, Z.; Werner, T.; Sutter, K.; Dolff, S.; Overbeck, M.; Limmer, A.; Liu, J.; Zheng, X.; Brenner, T.; Berger, M.

45,Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases the expression of the SARS-CoV2 entry protease TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells,"The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic pulmonary respiratory diseases (COPD). Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are playing a critical role in the immune response and in COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. In this report we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its virulence factor flagellin, a ligand of Toll-Like receptor 5 are able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in control and CF AEC. In contrast, no effect was observed with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium flagellin, used as an adjuvant in the clinical development of new vaccines against respiratory viruses. Considering the urgency of the health situation, this result is of major significance for patients with CRD (COPD, CF) which are frequently infected and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of the disease. In the general population, a P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 patients under intubation in intensive care units could be also deleterious and should be monitored with care.","Ruffin, M.; Bigot, J.; Calmel, C.; Corvol, H.; Balloy, V.; Guillot, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
46,"The SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Membrane proteins modulate maturation and retention of the Spike protein, allowing optimal formation of VLPs in presence of Nucleoprotein","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a {beta}-coronavirus, is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely {beta}-coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and/or N. By combining biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically, its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal production of virus like-particles. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.","Boson, B.; Legros, V.; Zhou, B.; Mathieu, C.; Cosset, F.-L.; Lavillette, D.; Denolly, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.260901v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.260901v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False

We previously reported that virus variants with spike protein S1/S2 junction deletions spanning this motif are attenuated. Here we characterize a further cell-adapted SARS-CoV-2 variant, Ca-DelMut. Ca-DelMut replicates more efficiently than wild type or parental virus in cells, but causes no apparent disease in hamsters, despite replicating in respiratory tissues. Unlike wild type virus, Ca-DelMut does not induce proinflammatory cytokines in hamster infections, but still triggers a strong neutralizing antibody response.

48,Discovery of drugs to treat cytokine storm-induced cardiac dysfunction using human cardiac organoids,"SARS-CoV2 infection leads to cardiac injury and dysfunction in 20-30% of hospitalized patients and higher rates of mortality in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Inflammatory factors released as part of the 'cytokine storm' are thought to play a critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients. Here we use human cardiac organoids combined with high sensitivity phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing to identify inflammatory targets inducing cardiac dysfunction. This state-of-the-art pipeline allowed rapid deconvolution of mechanisms and identification of putative therapeutics. We identify a novel interferon-{gamma} driven BRD4 (bromodomain protein 4)-fibrosis/iNOS axis as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This axis is therapeutically targetable using BRD4 inhibitors, which promoted full recovery of function in human cardiac organoids and prevented severe inflammation and death in a cytokine-storm mouse model. The BRD inhibitor INCB054329 was the most efficacious, and is a prime candidate for drug repurposing to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and improve COVID-19 mortality in humans.","Mills, R.

49,"Versatile, Multivalent Nanobody Cocktails for Highly Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization","The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global health and economy. Cost-effective therapeutics are urgently needed. Here, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered multiple elite Nbs of picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at as low as sub-ng/ml concentration, more potent than some of the best human neutralizing antibodies. We then determined a crystal structure of such an elite neutralizing Nb in complex with RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. Structural characterization facilitated the bioengineering of novel multivalent Nb constructs into multi-epitope cocktails that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. Our Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist heat, lyophilization, and aerosolization. These highly promising agents are readily translated into efficient, economic, and convenient therapeutics to help end this once-in-a-century health crisis.","Shi, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264333v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264333v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
50,Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2,"Previous work has indicated that contact tracing and isolation of index case and quarantine of potential secondary cases can, in concert with physical distancing measures, be an effective strategy for reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, contacts traced manually through the NHS Test and Trace scheme in the UK are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were exposed to the index case, which represents the upper bound for the incubation period. However, following previous work on screening strategies for air travellers it may be possible that this quarantine period could be reduced if combined with PCR testing. Adapting the simulation model for contact tracing, we find that quarantine periods of at least 10 days combined with a PCR test on day 9 may largely emulate the results from a 14-day quarantine period in terms of the averted transmission potential from secondary cases (72% (95%UI: 3%, 100%) vs 75% (4%, 100%), respectively). These results assume the delays from testing index cases' and tracing their contacts are minimised (no longer than 4.5 days on average). If secondary cases are traced and quarantined 1 day earlier on average, shorter quarantine periods of 8 days with a test on day 7 (76% (7%, 100%)) approach parity with the 14 day quarantine period with a 1 day longer delay to the index cases' test. However, the risk of false-negative PCR tests early in a traced case's infectious period likely prevents the use of testing to reduce quarantine periods further than this, and testing immediately upon tracing, with release if negative, will avert just 17% of transmission potential on average. In conclusion, the use of PCR testing is an effective strategy for reducing quarantine periods for secondary cases, while still reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially if delays in the test and trace system can be reduced, and may improve quarantine compliance rates.","Quilty, B.

51,Potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses are Associated with Better Prognosis in Hospital Inpatient COVID-19 Disease,"COVID-19 continues to cause a pandemic, having infected more than 20 million people globally. Successful elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will require an effective vaccine. However, the immune correlates of infection are currently poorly understood. While neutralizing antibodies are believed to be essential for protection against infection, the contribution of the neutralizing antibody response to resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been defined. In this study the antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins were investigated in a UK patient cohort, using optimised immunoassays and a retrovirus-based pseudotype entry assay. It was discovered that in severe COVID-19 infections an early antibody response to both antigens was associated with improved prognosis of infection. While not all SARS-CoV-2-reactive sera were found to possess neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing potency of sera was found to be greater in patients who went on to resolve infection, compared with those that died from COVID-19. Furthermore, viral genetic variation in spike protein was found to influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Infection with the recently described spike protein variant 614G produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to viruses possessing the 614D variant. These findings support the assertion that vaccines targeting generation of neutralizing antibodies may be useful at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 at time of diagnosis will be a useful addition to the diagnostic toolkit, enabling stratification of clinical intervention for severe COVID-19 disease.","Tighe, P.

52,Impact of population density on Covid 19 infected and mortality rate in India,"The residents living in areas with high population density, such as big or metropolitan cities have higher probability to come into close contact with others and consequently any contagious disease are expected to spread rapidly in dense areas. However, recently after analyzing Covid-19 cases in US researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, London school of economics and IZA Institute of Labor Economics conclude that spread of Covid-19 is not linked with population density. Here we investigate the influence of population density on Covid-19 spread and related mortality in the context of India.

53,Control Strategies against COVID-19 in China: Significance of Effective Testing in the Long Run,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is reasonably contained in China. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of different containment strategies in halting the pandemic spread in both short- and long-term. We combined a networked metapopulation SEIR model featuring undocumented infections, actual mobility data and Bayesian inference to simulate the counterfactual outbreak scenarios removing each one or a combination of the following three policies in place: i) city lockdowns, ii) intercity travel bans, and iii) testing, detection, and quarantine. Our estimates revealed that 11.4% [95% credible interval (CI): 9.7-13.0%] of the infected cases were unidentified before January 23, 2020. The rate grew to 92.5% [95% credible interval (CI): 85.9-94.5%] in early March, thanks to the boost in coronavirus testing capacity. We show that increasing the detection rate of infections from 11.4% to 92.5% alone would explain 75% of the reduction in infections from a no-policy baseline by March 15, 2020. The most pronounced policy implication is that city lockdowns appeared to be the more effective intervention in the short-run but effective testing is essential in containing the COVID-19 spread in the long run. By March 15, restoring within-city personal contact to its 2019 level would lead to a 678% growth in infections with all the other interventions remaining unaffected. Removing intercity travel restrictions and effective detection measures would lead to 3% and 477% growth, respectively. Extending the time horizon to July 15, the counterfactual increase in infections would become 581%, 3% and 30000% had the three classes of interventions been lifted individually.","Lin, Y.; Peng, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179697v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179697v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
54,Examining the status of improved air quality due to COVID-19 lockdown and an associated reduction in anthropogenic emissions,"Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. The COVID-19 lockdown worldwide resulted in controls on anthropogenic emission that have a significant synergistic effect on air quality ecosystem services (ESs). This study utilised both satellite and surface monitored measurements to estimate air pollution for 20 cities across the world. Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data were used for evaluating tropospheric air quality status during the lockdown period. Surface measurement data were retrieved from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, USA) for a more explicit assessment of air quality ESs. Google Earth Engine TROPOMI application was utilised for a time series assessment of air pollution during the lockdown (1 Feb to 11 May 2020) compared with the lockdown equivalent periods (1 Feb to 11 May 2019). The economic valuation for air pollution reduction services was measured using two approaches: (1) median externality value coefficient approach; and (2) public health burden approach. Human mobility data from Apple (for city-scale) and Google (for country scale) was used for examining the connection between human interferences on air quality ESs. Using satellite data, the spatial and temporal concentration of four major pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol index (AI) were measured. For NO2, the highest reduction was found in Paris (46%), followed by Detroit (40%), Milan (37%), Turin (37%), Frankfurt (36%), Philadelphia (34%), London (34%), and Madrid (34%), respectively. At the same time, a comparably lower reduction of NO2 is observed in Los Angeles (11%), Sao Paulo (17%), Antwerp (24%), Tehran (25%), and Rotterdam (27%), during the lockdown period. Using the adjusted value coefficients, the economic value of the air quality ESs was calculated for different pollutants. Using the public health burden valuation method, the highest economic benefits due to the reduced anthropogenic emission (for NO2) was estimated in US$ for New York (501M $), followed by London (375M $), Chicago (137M $), Paris (124M $), Madrid (90M $), Philadelphia (89M $), Milan (78M $), Cologne (67M $), Los Angeles (67M $), Frankfurt (52M $), Turin (45M $), Detroit (43M $), Barcelona (41M $), Sao Paulo (40M $), Tehran (37M $), Denver (30M $), Antwerp (16M $), Utrecht (14 million $), Brussels (9 million $), Rotterdam (9 million $), respectively. In this study, the public health burden and median externality valuation approaches were adopted for the economic valuation and subsequent interpretation. This one dimension and linear valuation may not be able to track the overall economic impact of air pollution on human welfare. Therefore, research that broadens the scope of valuation in environmental capitals needs to be initiated for exploring the importance of proper monetary valuation in natural capital accounting.","Sannigrahi, S.; Molter, A.; Kumar, P.; Zhang, Q.; Basu, B.; Basu, A.

To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-02-01 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.","Fisher, E.; Padula, L.; Podack, K.; O'Neill, K.; Seavey, M.

56,Modeling Hospital Energy and Economic Costs for COVID-19 Infection Control Interventions,"The objective of this study was to assess the energy demand and economic cost of two hospital-based COVID-19 infection control interventions. The intervention control measures evaluated include use of negative pressure (NP) treatment rooms and xenon pulsed ultraviolet (XP-UV) infection control equipment. After projecting COVID-19 hospitalizations, a Hospital Energy Model and Infection De-escalation Models are applied to quantify increases in energy demand and reductions in secondary infections. The scope of the interventions consisted of implementing NP in 11, 22, and 44 rooms (at small, medium, and large hospitals) while the XP-UV equipment was used eight, nine, and ten hours a day, respectively. The annum kilowatt-hours (kWh) for NP (and costs were at $0.1015 per kWh) were 116,700 ($11,845), 332,530 ($33,752), 795,675 ($80,761) for small, medium, and large hospitals ($1,077, $1,534, $1,836 added annum energy cost per NP room). For XP-UV, the annum kilowatt-hours and costs were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. There are other initial costs associated with the purchase and installation of the equipment, with XP-UV having a higher initial cost. XP-UV had a greater reduction in secondary COVID-19 infections in large and medium hospitals. NP rooms had a greater reduction in secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission in small hospitals. Early implementation of interventions can result in realized cost savings through reduced hospital-acquired infections.","Squire, M.

Design: A longitudinal, national, multi-centre, retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted for the first six weeks from March 17, 2020 from start of the national social distancing and then lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 as a comparative baseline. Setting: Hospitals from seven major urban cities were recruited around the UK, including London, representing a comprehensive national picture of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown at its peak. Participants: A total of 4840 clinical encounters were initially recorded. Exclusion criterion consisted of spinal pathology only. Post-exclusion, 4668 clinical encounters were recorded and analysed within the two timeframes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included the number of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, patient demographics, mortality rates, and the proportion of patients contracting COVID-19. Secondary outcomes consisted of the mechanism of injury, type of operative intervention and proportion of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia utilised. Demographics for each patient was recorded along with underlying medical co-morbidities. Sub-group analysis compared mortalities between both cohorts. Statistical analyses included mean (+/-SD), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance (p = 0.05). Results: During the COVID-19 period there was a 34% reduction in acute orthopaedic trauma referrals compared to 2019 (1792 down to 1183 referrals), and 29.5% less surgical interventions (993 down to 700 operations). The mortality rate significantly (both statistically and clinically) more than doubled for both risk and odds ratios during the COVID period in all referrals (1.3% vs 3.8%, p=0.0005) and in those undergoing operative intervention (2.2% vs 4.9%, p=0.004). Moreover, mortality due to COVID-related complications (versus non-COVID causes) had greater odds by a factor of at least 20 times. The odds ratios of road traffic accidents, sporting injuries, infection, and lower limb injuries were significantly less (by a third to a half) during the COVID period; albeit, the odds of sustaining neck of femur fractures and having falls <1.5m increased by more than 50%. For the operative cohorts, there was a greater odds of aerosolising-generating anaesthesia (including those with superimposed regional blocks) by three-quarters as well as doubling of the odds of a Consultant acting as the primary surgeon. Nevertheless, the odds of open reduction and internal fixation reduced by a quarter whereas removal of metalwork or foreign bodies reduced by three-quarters. Six-week Kaplan-Meier survival probability analysis confirmed those patients with neck of femur fracture and pre-existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were most at risk of mortality during the COVID-19 era. Conclusion: Although there was a reduction of acute trauma referrals and those undergoing operative intervention, the mortality rate still more than doubled in odds during the peak of the pandemic compared to the same time interval one year ago. Elderly patients with neck of femur fractures and existing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities were at the highest risk stratification for mortality. This was the first national study to assess impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute Orthopaedic trauma and it will aid clinicians in counselling trauma patients of the increased risk of mortality during the era of COVID-19 as well as acting as a risk-prediction tool influencing policymaking as the pandemic continues with potential subsequent waves.

58,How do socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviours?,"This study assesses how socio-demographic status and personal attributes influence protection behaviours during a pandemic, with protection behaviours being assessed through three perspectives: social distancing, personal protection behaviour and social responsibility awareness. The COVID-19 preventive behaviours were explored and compared based on the social-demographic and personal attributes of individuals. Using a publicly available and recently collected dataset on Japanese citizens during the COVID-19 early outbreak and exploiting both Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and regression analysis, the study notes that socio-demographic and personal attributes of individuals indeed shape the subjective prevention actions and thereby the control of the spread of a pandemic. Three socio-demographic attributes (sex, marital family status and having children) appear to have played an influential role in abiding by the COVID-19 protection behaviours by Japanese citizens, especially with women having children being noted more conscious than the male counterparts. Work status also appears to have some impact especially concerning social distancing and personal protection behaviour.

59,"Comparing the COVID-19 pandemic in space and over time in Europe, using numbers of deaths, crude rates and adjusted mortality trend ratios","Background Since COVID19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case/fatality proportion. Given the age and sex distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID19, the underlying sex and age distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for monitoring trends of COVID19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR). Methods Age and sex mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age and sex specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex and age adjusted mortality for COVID19 per million population in each country. Results The cumulative mortality from COVID19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland (which had a CMR in line with the total European population) emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of COVID19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy. Conclusions In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID19, comparable international data is a priority. Our methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the comparative mortality from COVID19 pandemic worldwide.","Gallo, V.; Chiodini, P.; Bruzzese, D.; Kondilis, E.; Howdon, D.; Mierau, J.; Bhopal, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179218v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179218v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
60,The effect of BMI and physical activity levels on the duration of symptomatic days with Covid-19 infection,"Regular exercise is known to boost immunity, increase immune response to fight infection, as well as speeding up recovery times and healing processes. This study seeks to assess if exercising regularly pre- SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and/or BMI status has an effect on recovery time. A total of 215 people infected with COVD-19 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took part in this study (age 36 years, mass 72 kg, stature 166 cm). Only 10 patients were physically active and fulfil WHO physical activity requirement (Age 30 years, Mass 77 kg, Stature 176 cm). There was a significant difference in recovery time between active and inactive patients (P=0.00) with active patients recovery 2.7 times faster than inactive patients. Active patients showed a lower BMI level (p=0.043). Anthropometric measurement characteristics and the fitness level could be used in decision making scenarios for the estimation of the risk of complications in patients with COVID-19.","Boukelia, B.; S Alataibi, A.

61,Correlation of National and Healthcare Workers COVID-19 Infection Data; Implications for Large-scale Viral Testing Programs,"Time analysis of the course of an infectious disease epidemic is a critical way to understand the dynamics of pathogen transmission and the effect of population scale interventions. Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, D.; Mac Aonghusa, P.; O'Shea, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179283v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,True
62,The unintended consequences of inconsistent pandemic control policies,"Controlling the spread of COVID-19 -- even after a licensed vaccine is available -- requires the effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, e.g., physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing, etc.. To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the United States of America (US), some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our mathematical model reveals that, across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than no measures at all. In the most severe cases, individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring jurisdictions can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.","Althouse, B.

63,Lipid droplets fuels SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammatory response,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that make use of the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic needs, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, as CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in human monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA. The pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.","Gomes Dias, S.

64,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using a vesicular stomatitis virus possessing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Tani, H.; Tan, L.; Kimura, M.; Yoshida, Y.; Yamada, H.; Fukushi, S.; Saijo, M.; Kawasuji, H.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Sakamaki, I.; Yamamoto, Y.; Morinaga, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1,2020-08-23,2020-08-23,,False
65,The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike is the key target of neutralizing antibody in human polyclonal sera.,"Natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans leads to the development of a strong neutralizing antibody response, however the immunodominant targets of the polyclonal neutralizing antibody response are still unknown. Here, we functionally define the role SARS-CoV-2 spike plays as a target of the human neutralizing antibody response. In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response. These data provide critical information for vaccine development and development of sensitive and specific serological testing.","Steffen, T.; Stone, E. T.; Hassert, M.; Geerling, E.; Grimberg, B.

66,Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD molecule with a T helper epitope as a built in adjuvant induces strong neutralization antibody response,"Without approved vaccines and specific treatment, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the world with above 20 million COVID-19 cases and approximately 700 thousand deaths until now. An efficacious and affordable vaccine is urgently needed. The Val308 - Gly548 of Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 linked with Gln830 - Glu843 of Tetanus toxoid (TT peptide) (designated as S1-4) and without TT peptide (designated as S1-5), and prokaryotic expression, chromatography purification and the rational renaturation of the protein were performed. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 protein was evaluated by Western Blotting (WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency of it was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256.

67,Ferrets not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-exposure domestic setting,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic COVID-19. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein (Spike) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data support that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. This may be overcome in laboratory settings using concentrated viral inoculum, but the effects of ferret host-adaptations require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, K.; Hill, N. J.; Puryear, W.

With the purpose of contributing to the development of effective therapeutics, this work provides an overview of the viral machinery and functional role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein, and a thorough analysis of the structure and druggability assessment of the viral proteome. All structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied, and whenever experimental structural data of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were not available, homology models were built based on solved SARS-CoV structures.

69,Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic β-CoVs,"The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.

SignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.","Pontes, C.; Ruiz-Serra, V.

70,Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","Lapointe, C. P.; Grosely, R.; Johnson, A. G.; Wang, J.; Fernandez, I.

However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in patients, including headache, seizures, stroke, and fatigue. The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","Pellegrini, L.; Albecka, A.; Mallery, D.

74,Targeting pentose phosphate pathway for SARS-CoV-2 therapy,"It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","Bojkova, D.; Costa, R.; Bechtel, M.; Ciesek, S.; Michaelis, M.; Cinatl, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.257022v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
75,Temporal landscape of mutation accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh: possible implications from the ongoing outbreak in Bangladesh,"Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population. Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","Saha, O.; Shatadru, R.

76,Characterization of cells susceptible to SARS-COV-2 and methods for detection of neutralizing antibody by focus forming assay,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the urgent need to determine what cells are susceptible to infection and for assays to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the ongoing efforts for vaccine development have necessitated the development of rapid, high-throughput methods of quantifying infectious SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ability to screen human polyclonal sera samples for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, our lab has adapted focus forming assays for SARS-CoV-2 using Vero CCL-81 cells, referred to in this text as Vero WHO. Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test. We have shown that this assay is a sensitive tool for determining SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer in human, non-human primate, and mouse polyclonal sera following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Additionally, we describe the viral growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of different immortalized cell lines and demonstrate via human ACE2 and viral spike protein expression that these cell lines can support viral entry and replication.","Stone, E.

77,COVID-19 and Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway: In silico Identification of an Interaction between alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and the Cryptic Epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR. We found that the interface of all studied protein complexes involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human 7 nAChR.","Lagoumintzis, G.; Chasapis, C.; Alexandris, N.; Tzartos, S.; Eliopoulos, E.; Farsalinos, K.; Poulas, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259747v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259747v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
78,Limited window for donation of convalescent plasma with high live-virus neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19 immunotherapy,"The optimal timeframe for donating convalescent plasma to be used for COVID-19 immunotherapy is unknown. To address this important knowledge deficit, we determined in vitro live-virus neutralizing capacity and persistence of IgM and IgG antibody responses against the receptor-binding domain and S1 ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in 540 convalescent plasma samples obtained from 175 COVID-19 plasma donors for up to 142 days post-symptom onset. Robust IgM, IgG, and viral neutralization responses to SARS-CoV-2 persist, in the aggregate, for at least 100 days post-symptom onset. However, a notable acceleration in decline in virus neutralization titers [&ge;]160, a value suitable for convalescent plasma therapy, was observed starting 60 days after first symptom onset. Together, these findings better define the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma useful for immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients and reveal important predictors of an ideal plasma donor, including age and COVID-19 disease severity score.

In an otherwise pseudo-random sequence, we search for forbidden combinations of kth order. We applied this method to analyze the available protein sequences of various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We found that these ubiquitous forbidden orders (UFO) are unique to each of the viruses we analyzed.

There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 {micro}g/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","Vega, J. C.; Bansal, S.; Jonsson, C. B.; Taylor, S.

81,"Astodrimer sodium, dendrimer antiviral, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, J.

82,Morphometry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 particles in ultrathin sections of infected Vero cell cultures.,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative of the COVID-19 disease, which has spread pandemically around the globe within a few months. It is therefore necessary to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution ([~]100 nm, without peplomers). SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The segmental peplomer density of SARS-CoV was approximately 30% higher than the corresponding peplomer density of SARS-CoV-2. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","Laue, M.; Kauter, A.; Hoffmann, T.; Michel, J.; Nitsche, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259531v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False

84,A Human-Immune-System mouse model for COVID-19 research(DRAGA mouse: HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2Rγc KO.NOD),"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates, and there is a compelling need for effective vaccines and therapeutic agents to lessen the severity of COVID-19 disease. Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R{gamma}c KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, T.-D.; Vir, P.; Shashikumar, S.; Karim, A.

85,Exploring G and C-quadruplex structures as potential targets against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"In this paper we report the analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.

To facilitate these objectives, we have profiled the repertoire of human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II)-bound peptides presented by HLA-DR diverse monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region.

High-throughput screening (HTS) offers the research field an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal.

Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild-moderate COVID-19 cases, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. RNA sequencing of single cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes allowed a high-resolution analysis of virus replication and host responses over time. Viral replication was mainly localized to the lower respiratory tract, with evidence of replication in the pneumocytes. Macrophages were found to play a role in initiating a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs, while also interacting with infected pneumocytes.

89,What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents? Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify mutation signatures and classify SARS-CoV-2 genomes,"Topic modeling is frequently employed for discovering structures (or patterns) in a corpus of documents. Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens/microbes).","Nagpal, S.; Srivastava, D.; Mande, S.

90,Susceptibility of raccoon dogs for experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.

The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","Sun, F.; Wang, X.; Tan, S.; Dan, Y.; Lu, Y.; Zhang, J.; Xu, J.; Tan, Z.; Xiang, X.; Zhou, Y.; He, W.; Wan, X.; Zhang, W.; Chen, Y.; Tan, W.; Deng, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.258376v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
92,A rapid and efficient screening system for neutralizing antibodies and its application for the discovery of potent neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD,"Neutralizing antibodies (Abs) have been considered as promising therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of pathogens. After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng/ml and 11.13 ng/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides a methodology for the generation of preventive and therapeutic antibody drugs for emerging infectious diseases.","Han, X.; Wang, Y.; Li, S.; Tang, N.; Hu, C.; Li, T.; Xie, Y.; Shen, M.; Wang, J.; Gu, C.; Hu, J.; Gong, F.; Wu, R.; Gao, F.; Huang, J.; Mu, S.; Luo, F.; Long, Y.; Song, S.; Long, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, Q.; Li, L.; Wu, Y.; Xu, W.; Cai, X.; Gao, Q.; Zhang, G.; He, C.; Wang, K.; Deng, K.; Du, L.; Nai, Y.; Wang, W.; Huang, A.; Jin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.253369v1?rss=1,2020-08-20,2020-08-20,,False
93,Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-{gamma} and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-{gamma} specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-{gamma} has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

Author SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate their efficacy in vivo.

94,SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c Is a Membrane-Associated Protein that Suppresses Antiviral Responses in Cells,"Disrupted antiviral immune responses are associated with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by SAR-CoV-2. Here, we show that the 73-amino-acid protein encoded by ORF9c of the viral genome contains a putative transmembrane domain, interacts with membrane proteins in multiple cellular compartments, and impairs antiviral processes in a lung epithelial cell line. Proteomic, interactome, and transcriptomic analyses, combined with bioinformatic analysis, revealed that expression of only this highly unstable small viral protein impaired interferon signaling, antigen presentation, and complement signaling, while inducing IL-6 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that interfering with ORF9c degradation by either proteasome inhibition or inhibition of the ATPase VCP blunted the effects of ORF9c. Our study indicated that ORF9c enables immune evasion and coordinates cellular changes essential for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

95,Identification of potential key genes for SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids based on bioinformatics analysis,"There is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that leads to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. Our study is to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological signaling pathways by using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression profiles of the GSE150819 datasets were originally produced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 (Homo sapiens). KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) were utilized to identify functional categories and significant pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that the Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, P53 signaling pathway, and Apoptosis are the main signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected human bronchial organoids (hBOs). Furthermore, NFKBIA, C3, and CCL20 may be key genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected hBOs.

Here, we report the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) produced from the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with NVX-CoV2373 and the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant induced anti-S antibody that was neutralizing and blocked binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Following intranasal and intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, immunized macaques were protected against upper and lower infection and pulmonary disease. These results support ongoing phase 1/2 clinical studies of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2327 vaccine (NCT04368988).

97,Spike protein mutational landscape in India: Could Mullers ratchet be a future game-changer for COVID-19?,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

SignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, R.; Basak, K.; Ghosh, A.; Rajachandran, V.; Sureka, K.; Ganguly, D.; Chattopadhyay, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255570v1?rss=1,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,,False

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and virus dissemination by dendritic cells. Notably, potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, underscoring the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as receptors and uncover that SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfates is an important mechanism for neutralization.
