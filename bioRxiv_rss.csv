0,Higher Comorbidities and Early Death is Characteristic of Hospitalized African-American Patients with COVID-19,"Background African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (53%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 'obese' range. 97% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic kidney disease (24%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age >60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87% died and of the remaining patients, 32% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","Gupta, R.; Agrawal, R.; Bukhari, Z.; Jabbar, A.; Wang, D.; Diks, J.; Alshal, M.; Emechebe, D.

1,The First Consecutive 5000 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 from Qatar; a Nation-wide Cohort Study,"Background There are limited data on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes at a national level, and none after 60 days of follow up. The aim of this study was to describe national, 60-day all-cause mortality associated with COVID-19, and to identify risk factors associated with admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods This was a retrospective cohort study including the first consecutive 5000 patients with COVID-19 in Qatar who completed 60 days of follow up by June 17, 2020. Outcomes included all-cause mortality at 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and risk factors for admission to ICU. Results Included patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 28 and April 17, 2020. The majority (4436, 88.7%) were males and the median age was 35 years [interquartile range (IQR) 28-43]. By 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 14 patients (0.28%) had died, 10 (0.2%) were still in hospital, and two (0.04%) were still in ICU. Fatal COVID-19 cases had a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 55.8-68), and were mostly males (13, 92.9%). All included pregnant women (26, 0.5%), children (131, 2.6%), and healthcare workers (135, 2.7%) were alive and not hospitalized at the end of follow up. A total of 1424 patients (28.5%) required hospitalization, out of which 108 (7.6%) were admitted to ICU. Most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized adults were diabetes (23.2%), and hypertension (20.7%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.061 per year increase; P <0.001], male sex (aOR 4.375, 95% CI 1.964-9.744; P <0.001), diabetes (aOR 1.698, 95% CI 1.050-2.746; P 0.031), chronic kidney disease (aOR 3.590, 95% CI 1.596-8.079, P 0.002), and higher BMI (aOR 1.067, 95% CI 1.027-1.108 per unit increase; P 0.001), were all independently associated with increased risk of ICU admission. Conclusions In a relatively younger national cohort with a low co-morbidity burden, COVID-19 was associated with low all-cause mortality. Independent risk factors for ICU admission included older age, male sex, higher BMI, and co-existing diabetes or chronic kidney disease.","Omrani, A. S.; Almaslamani, M. A.; Daghfal, J.; Alattar, R.

2,Improved COVID-19 Serology Test Performance by Integrating Multiple Lateral Flow Assays using Machine Learning,"Mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been complicated by the inaccessibility and, in some cases, inadequacy of testing options to detect present or past infection. Immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFAs) are a cheap and scalable modality for tracking viral transmission by testing for serological immunity, though systematic evaluations have revealed the low performance of some SARS-CoV-2 LFAs. Here, we re-analyzed existing data to present a proof-of-principle machine learning framework that may be used to inform the pairing of LFAs to achieve superior classification performance while enabling tunable False Positive Rates optimized for the estimated seroprevalence of the population being tested.","Mowery, C.

3,Coagulopathy in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Patients with COVID-19 frequently manifest coagulation abnormalities and thrombotic events. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the role of coagulopathy on the severity differences in patients with COVID-19. We conducted systematic literature search via Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang Database, CNKI, and medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, to identify all original studies that reports on coagulation parameters (D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB) during COVID-19 infection. Thereafter, we compared the coagulation parameters between less severe and more severe cases. All Statistical analyses were performed via Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were included from 25 studies. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibited significantly higher levels of D-dimer, PT, and FIB (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9%; SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2 42.4% respectively). However, difference in PLT and APTT levels between less severe and more severe patients was not statistically significant (SMD-0.26, 95% CI: -0.56-0.05, I2 82.2%; SMD-0.14,95% CI: -0.45-0.18, I2 75.5% respectively) This meta-analysis revealed coagulopathy is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Notably, D-dimer, PT, and FIB are the dominant parameters that should be considered in evaluating coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, X.; Yang, X.; Jiao, H.; Liu, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154138v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154138v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
4,Time-dependent dynamic transmission potential and instantaneous reproduction number of COVID-19 pandemic in India.,"Introduction: Dynamic tools and methods to assess the ongoing transmission potential of COVID-19 in India are required. We aim to estimate time-dependent transmissibility of COVID-19 for India using a reproducible framework. Methods: Daily COVID-19 case incidence time series for India and its states were obtained from https://api.covid19india.org/ and pre-processed. The Bayesian approach was adopted to quantify transmissibility at a given location and time, as indicated by the instantaneous reproduction number (Reff). The analysis was carried out in R version 4.0.2 using -EpiEstim_2.2-3- package. Serial interval distribution was estimated using -uncertain_si- algorithm with inputs of mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of mean serial intervals as 5.1, 1.2, 3.9 and 7.5 days respectively; and mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of standard deviations of the serial interval as 3.7, 0.9, 2.3, and 4.7 respectively with 100 simulations and moving average of seven days. Results. A total of 9,07,544 cumulative incident cases till July 13th, 2020 were analysed. Daily COVID-19 incidence in the country was seen on the rise; however, transmissibility showed a decline from the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic in India. The maximum Reff reached at the national level during the study period was 2.57 (sliding week ending April 4th, 2020). Reff on July 13th, 2020 for India was 1.16 with a range from 0.59 to 2.98 across various states/UTs. Conclusion. Reff provides critical feedback for assessment of transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus is a potential dynamic decision support tool for on-ground public health decision making","Singh, G.; Patrikar, S.; Sarma, P.; Soman, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154971v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154971v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
5,Utrametric diffusion model for spread of covid-19 in socially clustered population: Can herd immunity be approached in Sweden?,"We present a new mathematical model of disease spread reflecting specialties of covid-19 epidemic by elevating the role social clustering of population. The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus' spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting our purely diffusional model.","Khrennikov, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154419v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154419v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
6,Possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context,"The determination of the adequate time for house confinement and when social distancing restrictions should end are now two of the main challenges that any country has to face in an effective battle against. The possibility of a new outbreak of the pandemic and how to avoid it is, nowadays, one of the primary objectives of epidemiological research. In this work, we go deep in this subject by presenting an innovative compartmental model, that explicitly introduces the number of active cases, and employing it as a conceptual tool to explore the possible fates of the dispersion of SARS-COV-2 in the Mexican context. We incorporated the impact of starting, inattention, and end of restrictive social policies on the time evolution of the pandemics via time-in-run corrections to the infection rates. The magnitude and impact on the epidemic due to post-social restrictive policies are also studied. The scenarios generated by the model can help authorities to determine an adequate time and population load that may be allowed to reassume normal activities.","Santamaria-Holek, I.; Castano, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154526v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154526v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
7,Inference of COVID-19 epidemiological distributions from Brazilian hospital data,"Knowing COVID-19 epidemiological distributions, such as the time from patient admission to death, is directly relevant to effective primary and secondary care planning, and moreover, the mathematical modelling of the pandemic generally. Here we determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 using a large dataset (range N=21,000-157,000) from the Brazilian SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informacao de Vigilancia Epidemiologica da Gripe) database. We fit a set of probability distribution functions and estimate a symptom-onset-to-death mean of $15.2$ days for Brazil, which is lower than earlier estimates of 17.8 days based on early Chinese data. A joint Bayesian subnational model is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability distribution function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-discharge. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, I.; Mellan, T.

8,"Causal analysis of COVID-19 observational data in German districts reveals effects of mobility, awareness, and temperature","Mobility, awareness, and weather are suspected to be causal drivers for new cases of COVID-19 infection. Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated their causal effects on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable causal effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy), and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects of public mobility in retail and recreational areas, awareness measured by searches for ""corona"" in Google, and higher rainfall, leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases. This comprehensive causal analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","Steiger, E.; Mussgnug, T.; Kroll, L.

9,Short-term analysis and long-term predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in a seasonality regime: the Italian case,"As of July 14th, COVID-19 has caused in Italy 34.984 deaths and 243.344 infection cases. Strict lockdown policies were necessary to contain the first outbreak wave and prevent the Italian healthcare system from being overwhelmed by patients requiring intensive care. After the progressive reopening, predicting how the epidemic situation will evolve is urgent and fundamental to control any future outbreak and prevent a second wave. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to repeatedly calibrate the SIDARTHE model with data up to June 24th. The computed parameter distributions allow us to robustly analyse how the epidemic situation evolved and outline possible future scenarios. Assuming a seasonal regime for COVID-19, we tested different lockdown policies. Our results suggest that an intermittent lockdown where six ""open days"" are allowed every other week may prevent a resurgent exponential outbreak and, at the same time, ease the societal burden of an extensive lockdown.","Simoni, G.; Fochesato, A.; Reali, F.; Giordano, G.; Domenici, E.; Marchetti, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154500v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
10,Estimate of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using real time tracking of health care workers.,"BACKGROUND: Whether and to what degree SARS-CoV-2 is spread via the airborne route is unknown. Using data collected from health care worker interactions with hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness, we calculated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 via the airborne route. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: Healthcare worker interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tracked using a real time location system between March 18 and March 31. A value for q, the transmissibility expressed as quanta per hour, was estimated using a well-established model for airborne transmission. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among tracked HCWs was 2.21% (0.07-4.35). Transmissibility was estimated to be 0.225 quanta per hour, well below other well-characterized airborne pathogens. Simulations demonstrated that risk of infection is substantially reduced with increased ventilation of rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not well transmitted via the airborne route in controlled conditions. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be only opportunistically airborne, with most transmission occurring via droplet methods.","Hota, B.; Stein, B.; Lin, M.; Tomich, A.; Segreti, J.; Weinstein, R.

11,"Home-based and remote exercise testing in chronic respiratory disease, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: a rapid review","Objectives: To identify exercise tests that are suitable for home-based or remote administration in people with chronic lung disease. Methods: Rapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric properties. Results: 84 studies were included. Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, 2 studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, 5 studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (2 studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. Discussion: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","Holland, A. E.; Malaguti, C.; Hoffman, M.; Lahham, A.; Burge, A.

12,Projecting the second outbreaks for global COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 is now in an epidemic phase, with a second outbreak likely to appear at any time. The intensity and timing of a second outbreak is a common concern worldwide. In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded. We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking by governments and international organizations.","Huang, J.; Liu, X.; Zhang, L.; Yang, K.; Chen, Y.; Huang, Z.; Liu, C.; Lian, X.; Wang, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154161v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
13,Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a nationwide registry,"Objective. To analyze the spectrum and characteristics of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods. We conducted a nationwide, multicentric, retrospective study during the French COVID-19 epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurological manifestations were eligible. Results. We included 222 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations from 46 centers throughout the country. Median age was 65 years (IQR 53-72), and 136 patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in almost half of the patients (102, 45.2%). Brain imaging was performed in 192 patients (86.5%), including 157 MRI (70.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 97 patients (43.7%), with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in 2 out of 75 tested (2.7%). The most common neurological diseases were COVID-19 associated encephalopathy (CAE, 67/222, 30.2%), acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (AICS, 57/222, 25.7%), encephalitis (21/222, 9.5%), and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS, 15/222, 6.8%). Neurological manifestations appeared after first COVID-19 symptoms with a median delay of 6 days in CAE, 7 days in encephalitis, 12 days in AICS and 18 days in GBS. Around 25% of CAE and AICS were inaugural and 30% of CAE and encephalitis were diagnosed after discontinuation of sedation. Less common manifestations were also described, including meningitis and cranial neuropathy. The median follow-up of the patients was 24 days, with a particularly high short-term mortality rate in patients with CAE and AICS (19/124, 15.3%). Interpretation. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 mainly included CAE, AICS, encephalitis and GBS.

Mean age (SD) was 35.8(12.0) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had 3 or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Presence of hypertension or diabetes were associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. The epidemiologic curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers, and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic.

15,"Seasonality of non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses and the impact of meteorological factors","Background: Seasonality is a characteristic of some respiratory viruses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the seasonality and the potential effects of different meteorological factors on the detection rate of the non-SARS Corona Virus detection by PCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 12763 respiratory tract sample results (288 positive and 12475 negative) for non-SARS, non-MERS Corona viruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). The effect of seven single weather factors on the Corona virus detection rate was fitted in a logistic regression model with and without adjusting for other weather factors. Results: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern peaking from December to March and plunging from July to September. The seasonal effect was less pronounced in immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent. Different automatic variable selection processes agreed to select the predictors temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover and precipitation as remaining predictors in the multivariable logistic regression model including all weather factors, with low ambient temperature, low relative humidity, high cloud cover and high precipitation being linked to increased Corona virus detection rates. Conclusions: Corona virus infections followed a seasonal pattern, which was more pronounced in immunocompetent patients compared to immunosuppressed. Several meteorological factors were associated with the Corona virus detection rate. However, when mutually adjusting for all weather factors, only temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and cloud cover contributed independently to predicting the Corona virus detection rate.","Anastasiou, O.

16,The impact of host resistance on cumulative mortality and the threshold of herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2,"It is widely believed that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) required to prevent a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 is in excess of 50% for any epidemiological setting. Here, we demonstrate that HIT may be greatly reduced if a fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus due to innate resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses. The drop in HIT is proportional to the fraction of the population resistant only when that fraction is effectively segregated from the general population; however, when mixing is random, the drop in HIT is more precipitous. Significant reductions in expected mortality can also be observed in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection. These results help to explain the large degree of regional variation observed in seroprevalence and cumulative deaths and suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave.","Lourenco, J.; Pinotti, F.; Thompson, C.; Gupta, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154294v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154294v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

It was found that no seasonality in this form {varepsilon} occurs as far as a seasonality forcing behavior {varepsilon}' assumes most of the influence in SARS-COV-2 spreading patterns. Putting in order {varepsilon}' of influence, there were identified three main forms of SARS-COV-2 of transmission behavior: during epidemics growth, policies are the main stronger seasonality forcing behavior of the epidemics followed by secondary and weaker environmental and urban spaces driving patterns of transmission. At outbreaks and control phase, environmental and urban spaces are the main seasonality forcing behavior due to policies/ALE limitations to address heterogeneity and confounding scenario of infection. Finally regarding S and R compartments of SIR model equations, control phases are the most reliable phase to predictive analysis. These seasonality forcing behaviors cause environmental driven seasonality researches to face hidden or false observations due to policy/ALE interventions for each country and urban spaces characteristics. And also, it causes policies/ALE limitations to address urban spaces and environmental seasonality instabilities, thus generating posterior waves or uncontrolled patterns of transmission (fluctuations). All this components affect the SARS-COV-2 spreading patterns simultaneously being not possible to observe environmental seasonality not associated intrinsically with policies/ALE and urban spaces, therefore conferring to these three forms of transmission spreading patterns, specific regions of analysis for time series data extraction.","Telles, C.

18,Are the upper bounds for new SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany useful?,"At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus, called SARS--CoV--2, was reported in China and later in other parts of the world. First infections were reported in Germany by the end of January and on March 16th the federal government announced a partial lockdown in order to mitigate the spread. Since the dynamics of new infections started to slow down, German states started to relax the confinement measures as to the beginning of May. As a fall back option, a limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days was introduced for each city or district in Germany. If a district exceeds this limit, measures to control the spread of the virus should be taken. Based on a multi--patch SEAIRD--type model, we will simulate the effect of choosing a specific upper limit for new infections. We investigate, whether the politically motivated bound is low enough to detect new outbreaks at an early stage. Subsequently, we introduce an optimal control problem to tackle the multi--criteria problem of finding a bound for new infections that is low enough to avoid new outbreaks, which might lead to an overload of the health care system, but is large enough to curb the expected economic losses.","Bock, W.; Goetz, T.; Jayathunga, Y.; Rockenfeller, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155036v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155036v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

Design: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China. Self-administered questionnaires were collected via online platform in April 2020. Participants: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme in Hong Kong or Fujian. Setting: Students were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian (a prefecture-level city in eastern Fujian province). The institutions offered various healthcare programmes in degree or sub-degree levels. Main outcome measures: Compliances to social distancing and personal hygiene measures were assessed by 10-item Social Distancing Scale and 5-item Personal Hygiene Scale respectively. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the compliance outcomes. Results: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance to social distancing ({beta}=-0.31, p<0.001; {beta}=0.35, p=0.015; {beta}=0.33, p<0.001 respectively) and personal hygiene measures ({beta}=-0.16, p<0.001; {beta}=0.21, p<0.001; {beta}=0.16, p<0.001 respectively). Gender, geographical location, and clinical experience were the only three demographic variables having direct and/or indirect effects on social distancing and personal hygiene measures.

Conclusions: The predictive model constructed in this study is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance to infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance to social distancing and personal hygiene measures. Wishful thinking, contrasting to previous studies, was first found to positively associate with adherence to COVID-19 control measures.","Tang, A. C. Y.; Kwong, E. W. Y.; Chen, L.; Cheng, W. L.

20,"Estimating the burden of COVID-19 on mortality, life expectancy and lifespan inequality in England and Wales: A population-level study","Objective: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, life expectancy and lifespan inequality in the first half of 2020 (from week 1 to week 26 starting June 22) in England and Wales. Design: Demographic analysis of all-cause mortality from week 1 through week 26 of 2020 using publicly available death registration data from the Office for National Statistics. Setting and population: England and Wales population by age and sex in 2020. Main outcome measure: Age and sex-specific excess mortality risk and deaths above a baseline adjusted for seasonality in the first half of 2020. We additionally provide estimates of life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality defined as the standard deviation in age at death. Results: We estimate that there have been 53,937 (95% Prediction Interval: 53,092, 54,746) excess deaths in the first half of 2020, 54% of which occurred in men. Excess deaths increased sharply with age and men experienced elevated risks of death in all age groups. Life expectancy at birth dropped 1.7 and 1.9 years for females and males relative to the 2019 levels, respectively. Lifespan inequality also fell over the same period. Conclusions: Quantifying excess deaths and their impact on life expectancy at birth provides a more comprehensive picture of the full COVID-19 burden on mortality. Whether mortality will return to - or even fall below - the baseline level remains to be seen as the pandemic continues to unfold and diverse interventions are put in place.","Aburto, J.

21,A parsimonious model for spatial transmission and heterogeneity in the COVID-19 propagation,"Raw data on the cumulative number of deaths at a country level generally indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19 disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions, during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here, in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.","Roques, L.; Bonnefon, O.; Baudrot, V.; Soubeyrand, S.; Berestycki, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154740v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154740v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
22,Protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial of normobaric versus hyperbaric oxygen therapy for hypoxemic COVID-19 patients,"Background: At least 1 in 6 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and receiving supplemental oxygen will die of complications. More than 50% of patients with COVID-19 that receive invasive treatment such as mechanical ventilation will die in hospital. Such impacts overwhelm the limited intensive care unit resources and may lead to further deaths given inadequate access to care. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is defined as breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure higher than 1.4 atmosphere absolute (ATA). HBOT is safe, including for lungs, when administered by experienced teams and is routinely administrated for a number of approved indications. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests clinical improvement when hypoxemic COVID-19 patients are treated with HBOT. Objective: We aim to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for improving oxygenation, morbidity, and mortality among hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Methods and analysis: This trial is a sequential Bayesian Parallel-group, individually Randomized, Open, Blinded Endpoint controlled trial. Admitted hypoxemic COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen (without high flow and mechanical ventilation) to maintain a satisfying tissue oxygenation will be eligible to participate. The anticipated sample size of 234 patients is informed by data from a treatment trial of COVID patients recently published. The intervention group will receive one HBOT per day at 2.0 ATA for 75 minutes. Daily HBOT will be administered until either the patient does not require any oxygen supplementation or requires any type of mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygenation until day 28 post-randomization. Patients in the control group will receive the current standard of care treatment (no HBOT). The primary outcome of this trial will be the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale assessed on Day 7 post-randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: (a) clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, days with oxygen supplementation, oxygen flow values to obtain a saturation by pulse oximetry [&ge;]90%, intensive care admission and length of stay, days on invasive mechanical ventilation or high flow oxygen, sleep quality, fatigue, major thrombotic events, the 7-level COVID ordinal outcomes scale on Day 28; mortality, safety); (b) biological outcomes (plasma inflammatory markers); and (c) health system outcomes (cost of care and cost-effectiveness). Predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria have been specified. The analytical approach for the primary outcome will use a Bayesian proportional odds ordinal logistic semiparametric model. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Bayesian posterior probabilities will be calculated every 20 patients to assess accumulating evidence for benefit or harm. A planned subgroup analysis will be performed for pre-specified variables known to impact COVID-19 prognosis and/or HBOT (biologic sex and age). Discussion: Based on the mortality rate and substantial burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system, it is imperative that solutions be found. HBOT is a non-invasive and low-risk intervention when contraindications are respected. The established safety and relatively low cost of providing HBOT along with its potential to improve the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients make this intervention worth studying, despite the current limited number of HBOT centres. If this trial finds that HBOT significantly improves outcome and prevents further deterioration leading to critical care for severe COVID-19 patients, practice will change internationally. If no benefit is found from the intervention, then the current standard of care (no HBOT) will be supported by level I evidence.","Boet, S.; Katznelson, R.; Castelluci, L.

23,Obesity has an impact on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Background Recent observational studies suggested obesity to be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality as well as the role of body fat distribution in this context still unclear. Thus, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated the causal impact of obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Methods Obesity was quantified by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these anthropometric measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium (Locke et al. (n=322154); Shungin et al. (n=232101)) and for the COVID-19 susceptibility (n=1079768) as well as hospitalization (n = 900687) from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Causal estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques. Results Genetically predicted BMI was significantly associated (per one SD) with both, COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.72; P-value=0.001) and hospitalization (OR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.14; P-value=0.006). WC was associated with the susceptibility (OR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.78; P-value=0.015) but not with hospitalization. WHR was not associated with any of the COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions This study provides evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a risk group. Future research is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking obesity with COVID-19.","Freuer, D.; Linseisen, J.; Meisinger, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153825v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153825v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True

The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR, with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside internal controls that monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by nose-and-throat swabbing.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [&ge;]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

29,"The utility of established prognostic scores in COVID-19 hospital admissions: a multicentre prospective evaluation of CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA","INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing yet, due to the lack of a COVID-19 specific tool, clinicians must use pre-existing illness severity scores for initial prognostication. However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting. New prognostic tools including a focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse are needed. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","Frost, F.; Bradley, P.; Tharmaratnam, K.; North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR),; Wootton, D.

30,"Space-time patterns, change, and propagation of COVID-19 risk relative to the intervention scenarios in Bangladesh","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a significant public health threat worldwide. As of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 7.7 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths. The impacts are substantial particularly in developing and densely populated countries like Bangladesh with inadequate health care facilities, where COVID-19 cases are currently surging. While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not be pragmatically implementable in developing countries primarily due to social and economic reasons (i.e. poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). To shed light on COVID-19 transmission dynamics and impacts of NPI scenarios, e.g. social distancing, this study conducted emerging pattern analysis using the space-time scan statistic at district and thana (i.e. a sub-district or 'upazila' with at least one police station) levels in Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka city, respectively. We found that the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh are currently exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Dhaka megacity remains as the highest risk ""active"" cluster since early April. The space-time progression of COVID-19 infection, when validated against the chronicle of government press releases and newspaper reports, suggests that Bangladesh have experienced a community level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020) primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus-affected countries in the Europe and the Middle East. A linkage is evident between the violation of NPIs and post-incubation period emergence of new clusters with elevated exposure risk around Bangladesh. This study provides novel insights into the space-time patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and recommends pragmatic NPI implementation for reducing disease transmission and minimizing impacts in a resource-scarce country with Bangladesh as a case-study example.","Masrur, A.; Yu, M.; Luo, W.; Dewan, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154757v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154757v1?rss=1,2020-07-16,2020-07-16,,True
31,"COVID-19 effective reproductive ratio determination: An application, and analysis of issues and influential factors","An essential indicator of COVID-19 transmission is the effective reproduction number (Rt), the number of cases which an infected individual is expected to infect at a particular moment of time; curves of the evolution of Rt over time (transmission curves) reflect the impact of preventive measures and whether an epidemic is controlled. We have created a Shiny/R web application with user-selectable features: open data sources with daily COVID-19 incidences from all countries and many regions, customizable preprocessing options (smoothing, proportional increment, backwards distribution of negative corrections, etc), different MonteCarlo-Markov-Chain estimates of the generation time or serial interval distributions and state-of-the-art Rt estimation frameworks (EpiEstim, R0). We have analyzed the impact of these factors in the obtained transmission curves. We also have obtained curves at the national and sub-national level and analyzed the impact of epidemic control strategies, superspreading events, socioeconomic factors and outbreaks. We conclude that country wealth and, to a lesser extent, mitigation strategies, were associated with poorer epidemic control. Dataset quality was an important factor, and sometimes dictated the necessity of time series smoothing. We couldn't find conclusive evidence regarding the impact of alleged superspreading events. In the reopening phase, outbreaks had an impact on transmission curves. This application could be used interactively as a tool both to obtain transmission estimates and to perform interactive sensitivity analysis.","Bautista Balb&aacutes, L.

32,"Community-level SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey in urban slum dwellers of Buenos Aires City, Argentina: a participatory research.","Background By July 1st, the incidence rate of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.9% in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City. This study aimed to establish the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 three months after the first case was reported. Methods Between June 10th and July 1st, a cross-sectional design was carried out on people over 14 years old, selected from a probabilistic sample of households. A finger prick sample was tested by ELISA to detect IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Multilevel model was applied to understand sector, household and individual conditions associated with seroconvert. Results Prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95%IC 52.8% to 54.1%). Among the IgG positive cases, 15% reported having compatible symptoms at some point in the past two months. There is evidence of within-household clustering effect (rho=0.52; 95% IC 0.36-0.67); living with a PCR-confirmed case doubled the chance of being SARS-CoV2 IgG positive (OR 2.13; 95% IC 1.17-3.85). The highest risk of infection was found in one of the most deprived areas of the slum, the Bajo autopista sector. Discussion High seroprevalence is shown, for each symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed diagnosis, 9 people were IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probable asymptomatic) infections. Given that transmission among family members is a leading driver of the disease`s spread, it is unsurprising that crowded housing situations in slums are directly associated with higher risk of infection and consequently high seroprevalence levels. This study contributes to the understanding of population immunity against SARS-CoV2, its relation to living conditions and viral spread, for future decision making.","Figar, S.; Pagotto, V.; Luna, L.; Salto, J.; Wagner Manslau, M.; Mistchenko, A.; GAMARNIK, A.; Gomez Saldano, A.

33,Immuno-epidemiological life-history and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the next five years,"Uncertainty in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for future outbreaks. We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future Covid-19 cases given different impacts of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to dramatically different immunity landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination. Our findings illustrate likely complexities in future Covid-19 dynamics, and highlight the importance of immunological characterization beyond the measurement of active infections for adequately characterizing the immune landscape generated by SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Saad-Roy, C.

Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001). Individuals who engaged in more physical activity reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Although there were no differences in physical activity between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Conclusion: The COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon the physical activity habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage physical activity should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.","Faulkner, J.; O'Brien, W.; McGrane, B.; Wadsworth, D.; Batten, J.; Askew, C.

35,COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. before vs. after relaxation of social distancing measures,"Background: All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia implemented social distancing measures that interrupted transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reduced morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 51 jurisdictions have since begun to relax these measures, albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Methods: We obtained state-level data on implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures. We fitted mixed-effects linear regression models with a random effect for state, specifying the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt, the expected number of secondary infections generated by each index case given date-specific population susceptibility and risk behavior). Explanatory variables included time in days, implementation period (1-21 days prior to first relaxation of any statewide social distancing measure vs. time from relaxation through May 28, 2020), and a time-by-period product term. Results: During the three weeks prior to relaxation, the estimated Rt was declining by an average of 0.0016 units per day (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.0025 to -0.0008). At the time of initial relaxation, states had reported a median 7,628 cases (range, 337-361,313) and 289 COVID-attributable deaths (range, 7-28,663), and the median estimated Rt was 1.0 (range, 0.8-1.3) (i.e., the median rate of epidemic growth across states was estimated to be zero). After the first relaxation of statewide social distancing measures, the estimated Rt began increasing by an average of 0.0047 units per day (95% CI, 0.0037 to 0.0058) compared with the pre-relaxation period. If these trends continue, the estimated state-level Rt would reach an average value of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03-1.07) by 30 days after relaxation and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.18) by 60 days. A similar upward trajectory in the estimated Rt was observed after relaxation of statewide restrictions on internal movement. Conclusions: Relaxation of U.S. statewide social distancing measures was associated with a subsequent reversal of an earlier downward trend in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in states with less active epidemics at the time of relaxation.","Tsai, A.

The whole world is working relentlessly to find some solutions to fight against this deadly virus to reduce the number of deaths. Strategic planning with predictive modelling and short term forecasting for analyzing the situations based on the worldwide available data allow us to realize the future exponential behaviour of the COVID-19 disease. Time series forecasting plays a vital role in developing an efficient forecasting model for a future prediction about the spread of this contagious disease. In this paper, the ARIMA (Auto regression integrated moving average) and Holt-Winters time series exponential smoothing are used to develop an efficient 20- days ahead short-term forecast model to predict the effect of COVID-19 epidemic. The modelling and forecasting are done with the publicly available dataset from Kaggle as a perspective to India and its five states such as Odisha, Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.

To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020. Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals). Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18-44 years old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions; a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp (fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged 45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent) have been resolved remotely. Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics, an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case resolutions.","Zeltzer, D.; Vodonos Zilberg, A.; Paz, Y.

38,Interpreting Deep Ensemble Learning through Radiologist Annotations for COVID-19 Detection in Chest Radiographs,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, using these models in medical computer vision tasks suffers from several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations for COVID-19 detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution benefits from (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance compared to individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages to validate our claims; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We observe that: (i) ensemble approaches improved classification and localization performance; and, (ii) inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helped guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, S.; Sornapudi, S.; Alderson, P.

39,Graduate students significantly more concerned than undergraduates about returning to campus in the era of COVID-19,"Introduction: As students return to colleges and universities in the fall of 2020, it is important to understand their perception of risk and their desire for in person versus online learning, which may differ between undergraduate and graduate students. Methods: We anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their preferred learning strategies once back. We compared Strongly agree/Agree with Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree using a chi-square test. Results: Graduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% masters vs 20.8% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Graduate students were also less likely to prefer to be in the classroom as much as possible in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% masters vs 74.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Most were not concerned about their ability to conduct research. Students generally supported wearing of facemasks indoors. Conclusions: There are important differences in perception of risk and desire for online versus in-person learning between undergraduate and graduate students.

41,Observational Study of Chlorpromazine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,"On the grounds of its anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, chlorpromazine has been suggested to be effective treatment for Covid-19. We examined the association between chlorpromazine use and respiratory failure among all hospitalized adults with Covid-19 at the 39 Greater Paris University hospitals since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis adjusting for numerous potential confounders. We used a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Of the 12,217 adult inpatients with a positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test included in the analyses, 57 (0.47%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint occurred in 29 patients (50.9%) exposed to chlorpromazine and 1,899 patients (15.6%) who were not. In the main analysis, there was a positive significant association between chlorpromazine use and the outcome (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.56, p=0.019), while a Cox regression in a matched analytic sample yielded non-significant association (1.38; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.09, p=0.123).

42,Controlling COVID-19 via test-trace-quarantine,"COVID-19 containment efforts in the United States so far have largely focused on physical distancing, including school and workplace closures. However, these interventions have come at an enormous societal and economic cost. Here, we use an agent-based model, calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region, to investigate the feasibility of alternative control strategies, focusing on ""test-trace-quarantine"": a combination of (a) routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, (b) tracing and testing their known contacts, and (c) placing their contacts in quarantine. We assess the requirements for implementing this strategy, including its robustness to low compliance, delays, and other factors such as variability in overall transmission rates. We find that for the Seattle setting, if mask compliance remains high and schools remain closed, realistic levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control under a return to full workplace and community mobility.","Kerr, C.

43,Cell-based culture of SARS-CoV-2 informs infectivity and safe de-isolation assessments during COVID-19,"Background The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples collected from persons recovered from COVID-19 does not necessarily indicate shedding of infective virions. By contrast, the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based culture likely indicates infectivity, but there are limited data on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 culture and PCR. Here we review our experience using SARS-CoV-2 culture to determine infectivity and safe de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. Methods 195 patients with diverse severity of COVID-19 were tested (outpatients [n=178]), inpatients [n=12] and ICU [n=5]). SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were cultured in Vero C1008 cells and inspected daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE was confirmed by PCR of culture supernatant. Where no CPE was documented, PCR was performed on day four to confirm absence of virus replication. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of the day four PCR (Ctculture) and the PCR of the original clinical sample (Ctsample) were compared, and positive cultures were defined as a Ctsample - Ctculture value of greater than or equal to 3. Findings Of 234 samples collected, 228 (97%) were from the upper respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 was only successfully isolated from samples with Ctsample values <32, including in 28/181 (15%), 19/42 (45%) and 9/11 samples (82%) collected from outpatients, inpatients and ICU patients, respectively. The mean duration from symptom onset to culture positivity was 4.5 days (range 0-18 days). SARS-CoV-2 was significantly more likely to be isolated from samples collected from inpatients (p<0.001) and ICU patients (p<0001) compared with outpatients, and in samples with lower Ctsample values.

We report rapid early detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people. Methods Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection. Findings All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness (OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or cough. Interpretation RT-PCR rapidly and reliably detects early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak. RT-PCR testing in primary care should be prioritised for effective COVID-19 prevention and control.","Leber, W.; Lammel, O.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Mustafa-Korninger, M. E.; Stiasny, K.; Glehr, R.

45,Asthma in COVID-19: An extra chain fitting around the neck?,"Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.","Hussein, M.

46,A Quantitative Lung Computed Tomography Image Feature for Multi-Center Severity Assessment of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions and congested healthcare systems globally. Hence an objective severity assessment is crucial in making therapeutic decisions judiciously. Computed Tomography (CT)-scans can provide demarcating features to identify the severity of pneumonia, commonly associated with COVID-19, in the affected lungs. Here, a semi-quantitative severity assessing lung CT image feature is demonstrated for COVID-19 patients. An open-source multi-center Italian database was used, among which 61 cases were incorporated in the study (age 27-86, 71% males) from 27 CT imaging centers. Lesions in the form of opacifications, crazy-paving patterns, and consolidations were heuristically marked and the severity determining feature L_norm was quantified and established to be statistically distinct for the three classes i.e., mild, moderate, and severe (p-value < 0.0001). The thresholds of L_norm for a 3-class classification were determined based on the optimum sensitivity/specificity combination from ROC analyses. The feature L_norm classified the cases in the three severity categories with 89.34% accuracy when L_norm was calculated based on experts' heuristic annotations. Substantial to almost-perfect intra-rater and inter-rater agreements were achieved involving expert and non-expert based evaluations ({kappa}-score 0.79-0.97). We trained machine learning based classification models and showed L_norm alone has a superior diagnostic accuracy over standard image intensity and texture features. Classification accuracy was further increased when L_norm was used to delineate the severe cases from non-severe ones (98.9%) with high sensitivity (97.7%), and specificity (97.49%). Therefore, key highlights of this severity assessment feature are accuracy, lower dependency on expert availability, and wide utility across multiple imaging centers.","Ghosh, B.; Kumar, N.; Sadhu, A.

47,Size Dependent Particle Removal Efficiency and Pressure Drop of a Dust Cleaning Material For Use as Facemask Filters for Protection during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe demand for facemasks, and this has resulted in the use of those made from alternate media. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily due to airborne droplets, it is critical to verify the filtration efficiency of these alternate media based facemasks. While several media are being tested and used, commercially available dust cleaners have shown reasonable filtration efficiency. This may also be due to the potential electrostatic charge on the surface which enhances capture of the fine particles. In this manuscript, we report the size dependent filtration efficiency studied systematically in a filter holder-based system as 47 mm punches; and test results on a mannequin that was 3D printed wearing a bandana mask that was placed in a chamber.","Dhanraj, D.; Choudhary, S.; Raven, P.; Biswas, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151985v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151985v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
48,"The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier: Kinetics, distribution, mechanisms, and influence of ApoE genotype, sex, and inflammation","Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 +/- 0.024 microL/g-min and 0.294 +/- 0.032 microL/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood. ApoE isoform or sex did not affect whole brain uptake, but had variable effects on olfactory bulb, liver, spleen, and kidney uptakes. In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.","Rhea, E. M.; Logsdon, A.

49,Prophylactic and Therapeutic Inhibition of In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Oleandrin,"With continued expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, antiviral drugs are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease and even to limit spread if administered early during infection. Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98 ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07 ng/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.","Plante, K.

50,A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells,"SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","Schmidt, N.; Lareau, C.

51,Women in power: Female leadership and public health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Some countries have been more successful than others at dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. When we explore the different policy approaches adopted as well as the underlying socio-economic factors, we note an interesting set of correlations: countries led by women leaders have fared significantly better than those led by men on a wide range of dimensions concerning the global health crisis. In this paper, we analyze available data for 35 countries, focusing on the following variables: number of deaths per capita due to COVID-19, number of days with reported deaths, peaks in daily deaths, deaths occurred on the first day of lockdown, and excess mortality. Results show that countries governed by female leaders experienced much fewer COVID-19 deaths per capita and were more effective and rapid at flattening the epidemic's curve, with lower peaks in daily deaths. We argue that there are both contingent and structural reasons that may explain these stark differences. First of all, most women-led governments were more prompt at introducing restrictive measures in the initial phase of the epidemic, prioritizing public health over economic concerns, and more successful at eliciting collaboration from the population. Secondly, most countries led by women are also those with a stronger focus on social equality, human needs and generosity. These societies are more receptive to political agendas that place social and environmental wellbeing at the core of national policymaking.","Coscieme, L.; Fioramonti, L.; Mortensen, L.

52,Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"Background and Purpose Reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology. Methods We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022). Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","Ayub, N.; Cohen, J.; Jing, J.; Jain, A.; Tesh, R.; Mukerji, S.

54,Antigenic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in response to immune pressure,"The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is expected to be at least partially driven by the selective pressure imposed by the human immune system. We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the virus.","Forni, D.; Cagliani, R.; Pontremoli, C.; Mozzi, A.; Pozzoli, U.; Clerici, M.; Sironi, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204610v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
55,Alignment-free machine learning approaches for the lethality prediction of potential novel human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide,"A newly emerging novel coronavirus appeared and rapidly spread worldwide and World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The roles and characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe on humans. The detection of the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide perspective for treatment. We developed alignment-free machine learning approaches for an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted coronavirus using genomic nucleotide. We performed extensive experiments through six different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms in combination with digital signal processing to infer the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses using previous existing strains. The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human coronaviruses. Our study achieves high levels of prediction performance based on raw RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge. The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this alignment-free machine learning-based approach can offer a reliable real-time estimation for its viral lethality.","YIN, R.; Luo, Z.; Kwoh, C.

56,Bioinformatic analysis of shared B and T cell epitopes amongst relevant coronaviruses to human health: Is there cross-protection?,"Within the last 30 years 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have evolved and adapted to cause disease and spread amongst the human population. From the three, SARS-CoV-2 has spread world-wide and to July 2020 it has been responsible for more than 11 million confirmed cases and over half a million deaths. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, social distancing has been the most effective measure to control the pandemic. However it has become evident that as the virus spreads the only tool that will allow us to fully control it is an effective vaccine. There are currently more than 150 vaccine candidates in different stages of development using a variety of viral antigens, with the S protein being the most targeted antigen. Although some new experimental evidence suggests cross-reacting responses between coronaviruses are present in the population, it remains unknown whether potential shared antigens between different coronaviruses could provide cross-protection. Given that coronaviruses are emerging pathogens and continue to represent a threat to global health, the development of a SARS-Cov-2 vaccine that could provide universal protection against other coronaviruses should be pushed forward. Here we present a thorough review of reported B and T cell epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and other relevant coronaviruses, in addition we used web-based tools to predict novel B and T cell epitopes that have not been reported before. Analysis of experimental evidence that is constantly emerging complemented with the findings of this study allow us support the hypothesis that cross-reactive responses, particularly those coming from T cells, might play a key role in controlling infection by SARS-CoV-2. We hope that with the evidence presented in this manuscript we provide arguments to encourage the study of cross-reactive responses in order to elucidate their role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Finally we expect our findings will aid targeted analysis of antigen-specific immune responses and guide future vaccine design aiming to develop a cross reactive effective vaccine against respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.","Pacheco-Olvera, D.

57,Comparative multiplexed interactomics of SARS-CoV-2 and homologous coronavirus non-structural proteins identifies unique and shared host-cell dependencies,"Human coronaviruses (hCoV) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-OC43 - an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains. We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response (UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4 interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins.

58,Quantifying the impacts of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19: an empirical analysis from 344 cities of China,"Abstract Objective Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), human mobility restriction measures have raised controversies, partly due to inconsistent findings. Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","Tan, J.; Xiong, Y.-q.; Zhao, S.; Liu, C.; Huang, S.; Lu, X.; Thabane, L.; Xie, F.; Sun, X.; Li, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20148668v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20148668v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
59,Comprehensive analysis of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in different geographic regions of India: An endeavour to classify Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains on the basis of co-existing mutations,"Accumulation of mutations within the genome is the primary driving force for viral evolution within an endemic setting. This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility as well as antigenic shift to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we aimed at genome-wide analyses of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses for the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their spatial distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 441 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 21 being distinctive to India. Emergence of novel mutations were observed in S glycoprotein (7/33), NSP3 (6/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33) and N (2/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.4 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on the co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that representative strain of each group divided themselves into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. India was dominated by A2a clade (55.60%) followed by A3 (37.38%) and B (7%), but exhibited heterogeneous distribution among various geographical regions. The A2a clade mostly predominated in East India, Western India and Central India, whereas A3 clade prevailed in South and North India. In conclusion, this study highlights the divergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains and co-circulation of multiple clades in India. Monitoring of the emerging mutations would pave ways for vaccine formulation and designing of antiviral drugs.","Sarkar, R.; Mitra, S.; Chandra, P.; Saha, P.; Banerjee, A.; Dutta, S.; Chawla-Sarkar, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.203463v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False
60,Bivalent binding of a fully human IgG to the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins reveals mechanisms of potent neutralization,"In vitro antibody selection against pathogens from naive combinatorial libraries can yield various classes of antigen-specific binders that are distinct from those evolved from natural infection. Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction. Here we report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naive human Fab library. Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the ""up"" and the other in the ""down"" position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, B.; Asarnow, D.; Lee, W.-H.; Huang, C.-W.; Faust, B.; Ng, P. M. L.; Ngoh, E. Z.

61,Evidence of SARS-CoV2 entry protein ACE2 in the human nose and olfactory bulb,"Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptom. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human, post-mortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia of via the olfactory pathway.","Klingenstein, M.; Klingenstein, S.; Neckel, P.

62,Evaluation of NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome characterisation,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been performed at unprecedented rate worldwide with the use of very diverse Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2/8 and 1/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct [&ge;]25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","Charre, C.; Ginevra, C.; Sabatier, M.; Regue, H.; Brun, S.; Burfin, G.; Scholtes, C.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Bal, A.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201947v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,False

We report herein a therapeutic based on catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species, which are excessively produced resulting from the infection and inflammatory process. Catalase assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity.

64,The Effect Of Famotidine On SARS-CoV-2 Proteases And Virus Replication,"The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","Loffredo, M.; Lucero, H.; Chen, D.-Y.; O'Connell, A.; Bergqvist, S.; Munawar, A.; Bandara, A.; DeGraef, S.; Weeks, S.

65,Comparison of the COVID-19 infection risks by close contact and aerosol transmission,"A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human-to-human transmission by close contact where large respiratory droplets play a significant role has been established as the main transmission route. At the same time the transmission by small aerosol is getting increasing attention. There is no distinct boundary between droplets and aerosol in nature so it is natural to investigate the infection risk due to aerosol. Here, we utilized a newly developed dose-response relation, combined with a box model for the exposure estimation, to quantitatively evaluate the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol transmission and compared with the risk due to close contact. The results indicated that the median infection risk via aerosol transmission was about 3.7x10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5x10-6 to 4.4x10-4) for one hour of exposure in a room with the size of 10 m (width)x10 m (length)x3 m (height) with one infected individual in it. The risk was more than three orders of magnitude lower than the risk at short distance, about 12.8% within 1 m, based on a meta-analysis. A simple exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90xD+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be utilized to characterize the magnitude of infection risk in the considered scenario based on the distance D from the infected individual. With prolonged exposure duration and large exposed population, the infection caused by aerosol transmission could be considerable, thus it is necessary to be cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in such situations.","Zhang, X.; Wang, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152900v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152900v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
66,Connecting in COVID 19: Neurology tele-follow-up experience,"Introduction: The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic led to temporary closure of routine hospital services. This prompted the initiation of teleconsult follow-up in our department. The study outlines the experience of tele-follow-up at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, and the perspective of neurologists about this novel approach. Methods: The tele-follow-up was started from 26th March 2020. Data of follow up appointments was provided by the medical record section. The faculty and senior residents conducted the tele-follow-up. Communication was made via voice calls. The data for initial ten days was analyzed to find the utility and experience of the new service. Results: In the initial ten working days, data of 968 patients was provided for tele-follow-up. A successful communication was made in 50.3% patients (contact with patients: 27.7% and family members 22.6%). The phone numbers which were not contactable/invalid/not available constituted 36.8% of the data. A total of 35 faculty and residents conducted the tele-follow-up. The utility of tele-follow-up was perceived as good by 71.4% of neurologists. Majority of neurologists (71.4%) observed that [&ge;]90% of patients were continuing medications. Patients outside the city constituted 50-75% of the list.

67,Estimating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections: systematic review,"Abstract Background: Accurate seroprevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations could help gauge the true magnitude and spread of the infection seroprevalence. Reported estimates have varied greatly, but many have derived from biased samples, and inadequate testing methods. Objective: To estimate the range of valid seroprevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations, and compare these seroprevalence estimates with the cumulative cases seen in the same population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe-PMC for published studies and pre-prints from January 2020 to 25 May 2020 that reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and/or IgA antibodies for serosurveys of either the general community or of defined sub-populations, such healthcare workers and other organizations. Results: Of the 837 studies identified, 49 were assessed and 14 were includable. Included studies represented 10 countries and 100,557 subjects: 9 from randomly selected populations, 2 from healthcare workers, 2 from industry populations, and 1of parturient women. The seroprevalence proportions in 10 studies ranged between 1%-10%, and 2 study estimates under 1%, and 2 over 10% - from the notably hard-hit regions of Gangelt in Germany and from Northwest Iran. The two studies in healthcare workers, in Italy and Spain, had seroprevalence rates at higher range of estimates, with the Barcelona hospitals having a higher rate than the Spanish national survey. For only one study was the seroprevalence estimate higher than the cumulative incidence, though these were proximate for several studies. In five studies, the seroprevalence was similar to the cumulative case numbers in the same population. For seropositive cases not previously detected as COVID-19 cases, the majority had prior COVID-like symptoms. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 mostly less than 10% with the level of infection lower in the general community, suggesting levels well below herd immunity. The similarity of seroprevalence and reported cases is several studies, and high symptom rates in seropositive cases suggest that gaps between seroprevalence rates and reported cases are likely due to undertesting of symptomatic people.","Byambasuren, O.; Dobler, C.

Pooling methods can enhance testing efficiency, but they are viable only at very low prevalences of the disease. We propose Smart Pooling, a machine learning method that uses sociodemographic data from patients to increase the efficiency of pooled molecular testing for COVID-19 by arranging samples into all-negative pools. We show efficiency gains of 42% with respect to individual testing at disease prevalence of up to 25%, a regime in which two-step pooling offers marginal efficiency gains. Additionally, we calculate the possible efficiency gains of one- and two-dimensional two-step pooling strategies and present the optimal strategies for disease prevalences up to 25%.

69,Work Related and Personal Predictors of Covid 19 transmission,"The paper provides new evidence from a survey of 2000 individuals in the US and UK related to predictors of Covid-19 transmission. Specifically, it investigates work and personal predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker, evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, risk-aversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to prevent or contain transmission.","Anand, P.; Allen, H.; Ferrer, R.; Gold, N.; Gonzales Martinez, R.

70,Dissemination and co-circulation of SARS-CoV2 subclades exhibiting enhanced transmission associated with increased mortality in Western Europe and the United States,"Mechanisms underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like clinical manifestations leading to deaths in patients who develop COVID-19 remain uncharacterized. While multiple factors could influence these clinical outcomes, we explored if differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 variants could contribute to these terminal clinical consequences of COVID-19. We analyzed 34,412 SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV2 sequence database to determine if regional differences in circulating strain variants correlated with increased mortality in Europe, the United States, and California. We found two subclades descending from the Wuhan HU-1 strain that rapidly became dominant in Western Europe and the United States. These variants contained nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations in the Orf1ab segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (C14408T), the spike protein gene (A23403G), and Orf1a (G25563T), which resulted in non-conservative amino acid substitutions P323L, D614G, and Q57H, respectively. In Western Europe, the A23403G-C14408T subclade dominated, while in the US, the A23403G-C14408T-G25563T mutant became the dominant strain in New York and parts of California. The high cumulative frequencies of both subclades showed inconsistent but significant association with high cumulative CFRs in some of the regions. When the frequencies of the subclades were analyzed by their 7-day moving averages across each epidemic, we found co-circulation of both subclades to temporally correlate with peak mortality periods. We postulate that in areas with high numbers of these co-circulating subclades, a person may get serially infected. The second infection may trigger a hyperinflammatory response similar to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) response, which could explain the ARDS-like manifestations observed in people with co-morbidity, who may not mount sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies against the first infection. Further studies are necessary but the implication of such a mechanism will need to be considered for all current COVID-19 vaccine designs.","Hu, Y.; Riley, L.

71,Association between epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 infection and ABO blood group types,"Background: Covid-19 pandemic is the most critical challenge nowadays for the manhood, and the infection and death cases are still speedily increasing. Since there are no available vaccine and specifically effective treatment, to break the infectious way of the pandemic remains the unique measure to efficiently combat Covid-19 infection. Understanding factors that affect the Covid-19 infection can help make better balance between activity restriction and infection dynamics. This study sought to investigate association between Covid-19 infection and blood type distribution. Methods: The big data provided by World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University were taken to assess epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 infection. Growth rate and doubling time of infection and death cases, reproductive number, infection and death cases in the mid-exponential phase were analyzed in relation to blood type distribution. Results: Growth rate of infection and death cases correlated significantly to blood type A proportion of the population positively while to blood type B proportion negatively. In comparison with lower blood type A population (< 30%) people with higher blood type A ([&ge;] 30%) had more infection and death cases in the early exponential phase, higher growth rates, and shorter case doubling time for infection and death. Discussion: Covid-19 infection is significantly associated with blood type distribution and people with blood type A are more susceptible to Covid-19 infection and have higher epidemic dynamics and higher case fatality rate.

Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine were less likely to be discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60.3% vs. 62.8%; rate ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99) and those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (29.8% vs. 26.5%; risk ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25). There was no excess of new major cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality but was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.","Horby, P.; Mafham, M.; Linsell, L.; Bell, J.

73,Covid-19 infection and attributable mortality in UK Long Term Care Facilities: Cohort study using active surveillance and electronic records (March-June 2020),"Background: Rates of Covid-19 infection have declined in many countries, but outbreaks persist in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) who are at high risk of severe outcomes. Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

74,Endocrine disrupting chemicals and COVID-19 relationships: a computational systems biology approach,"Background: Patients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might aggravate the course of COVID-19. Objectives: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative systems biology approach was constructed and applied. Methods: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources. Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19 comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis. Results: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways were particularly promising. Conclusions: Pathways were identified as possible targets of EDCs and as contributors to COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby contributing to toxicology prediction.","Wu, Q.; Coumoul, X.; Grandjean, P.; Barouki, R.; Audouze, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150714v1?rss=1,2020-07-15,2020-07-15,,True
75,CHEST DRAIN AEROSOL GENERATION IN COVID-19 AND EMISSION REDUCTION USING A SIMPLE ANTI-VIRAL FILTER,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by significant in-hospital virus transmission and deaths among healthcare workers. Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 microns). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs, reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count/cubic foot (pc/ft3) within six channel sizes: 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and >10 microns. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p-values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS Aerosol emissions increased with increased air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3-3 microns). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 microns) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc/ft3 at 1, 3 and 5 L/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H2O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSIONS A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter. These data should be considered when designing measures to reduce in-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2.","DUFFY, C.; KIDD, A.; FRANCIS, S.; TSIM, S.; MCNAUGHTON, L.; FERGUSON, K.; FERGUSON, J.; RODGERS, G.; McGROARTY, C.; SAYER, R.; BLYTH, K.

78,COVID-19 misinformation: mere harmless delusions or much more? A knowledge and attitude cross-sectional study among the general public residing in Jordan,"Abstract Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.","Sallam, M.; Dababseh, D.; Yaseen, A.; Al-Haidar, A.; Taim, D.; Eid, H.; Ababneh, N.

79,Effects of Tocilizumab in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Quasi-Experimental Study,"Critically ill patients with COVID-19 may suffer from a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by remarkably high levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We assessed the effects of tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, on intra-hospital mortality and development of positive cultures in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. In this study, patients with COVID 19 admitted in the ICU who were treated with tocilizumab plus standard care were enrolled and compared to controls. Main outcome: 1) intra-hospital mortality; Secondary Outcomes: 1) the need for renal replacement therapy, 2) use of antibiotics and positive culture, and 3) inflammatory and oxygenation markers. Results: There was no difference in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, use of antibiotics or positive cultures between the two groups. The use of corticosteroids was more frequent in the treatment group. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and WBC (white blood cells) counts declined significantly faster in the treatment group. Oxygenation markers rose significantly higher in patients in the tocilizumab group as compared to controls.

80,"Post lockdown COVID-19 seroprevalence and circulation at the time of delivery, France","Background To fight the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown has been decreed in many countries worldwide. The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever, myalgia and anosmia, was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic in order to adapt public health measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as social distancing and teleworking for this specific population.","Mattern, J.; Vauloup-Fellous, C.; Zakaria, H.; Benachi, A.; Carrara, J.; Letourneau, A.; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, N.; De Luca, D.; Doucet-Populaire, F.; Vivanti, A.

81,Mechanistic Transmission Modeling of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship Demonstrates the Importance of Aerosol Transmission,"Background The current prevailing position is that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted primarily through large respiratory droplets within close proximity (i.e., 1-2 m) of infected individuals. However, quantitative information on the relative importance of specific transmission pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (i.e., droplets, aerosols, and fomites across short- and long-range distances) remains limited. Methods To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We developed a framework that combines stochastic Markov chain and negative exponential dose-response modeling with available empirical data on mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and human behaviors, which informs a modified version of the Reed-Frost epidemic model to predict daily and cumulative daily case counts on the ship. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors, including the magnitude of droplet and aerosol emissions from infected individuals, the infectious dose for deposition of droplets and aerosols to the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and others. Findings A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations yields insights into the likely values for uncertain parameters and quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases aboard the ship across the entire simulation time period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of large respiratory droplets and small respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%. Short-range transmission was the dominant mode after passenger quarantine began, albeit due primarily to aerosol transmission, not droplets. Interpretation Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions. Although cruise ships represent unique built environments with high ventilation rates and no air recirculation, these findings underscore the importance of implementing public health measures that target the control of inhalation of aerosols in addition to ongoing measures targeting control of large droplet and fomite transmission, not only aboard cruise ships but in other indoor environments as well.","Azimi, P.; Keshavarz, Z.; Cedeno Laurent, J.

82,"Low SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence based on anonymized residual sero-survey before and after first wave measures in British Columbia, Canada, March-May 2020","Background: The province of British Columbia (BC) has been recognized for successful SARS-CoV-2 control, with surveillance data showing amongst the lowest case and death rates in Canada. We estimate sero-prevalence for two periods flanking the start (March) and end (May) of first-wave mitigation measures in BC. Methods: Serial cross-sectional sampling was conducted using anonymized residual sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network, including children and adults in the Greater Vancouver Area (population ~3 million) where community attack rates were expected to be highest. Screening used two chemiluminescent immuno-assays for spike (S1) and nucleocapsid antibodies. Samples sero-positive on either screening assay were assessed by a third assay targeting the S1 receptor binding domain plus a neutralization assay. Age-standardized sero-prevalence estimates were based on dual-assay positivity. The May sero-prevalence estimate was extrapolated to the source population to assess surveillance under-ascertainment, quantified as the ratio of estimated infections versus reported cases. Results: Serum collection dates spanned March 5-13 and May 15-27, 2020. In March, two of 869 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.28% (95%CI=0.03-0.95). Neither specimen had detectable neutralizing antibodies. In May, four of 885 specimens were dual-assay positive, with age-standardized sero-prevalence of 0.55% (95%CI=0.15-1.37%). All four specimens had detectable neutralizing antibodies. We estimate ~8 times more infections than reported cases. Conclusions: Less than 1% of British Columbians had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 when first-wave mitigation measures were relaxed in May 2020. Our findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in BC, but also substantial residual susceptibility. Further sero-survey snapshots are planned as the pandemic unfolds.","Skowronski, D. M.; Sekirov, I.; Sabaiduc, S.; Zou, M.; Morshed, M.; Lawrence, D.; Smolina, K.; Ahmed, M.

Although a number of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, we still lack an understanding of the overall landscape of B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires in COVID-19 patients. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of BCR repertoires collected over multiple time points during an infection to characterize statistical and dynamical signatures of the B-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 patients with different disease severities. Based on principled statistical approaches, we determined differential sequence features of BCRs associated with different disease severity. We identified 34 significantly expanded rare clonal lineages shared among patients as candidates for a specific response to SARS-CoV-2.

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 requiring ventilation is acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with multi-functional failure as a result of a cytokine storm with increased serum levels of cytokines such as TNF- and IL-6 being reported. TNF- levels are increased during the cytokine storm in very ill patients and soluble receptors for IL-6 and IL-2 are present in the blood of COVID-19 patients, Objectives: To elucidate the involvement of serum levels of soluble TNF-Receptor of severe and mild COVID-19 patients to determine for severity of disease. Method: We recruited 16 severe COVID-19 patients in the ICU on ventilator support and 26 milder COVID-19 patients who were hospitalised but not within the intensive care unit (ICU) between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. After harvesting of whole blood the serum was isolated and soluble TNF-Receptor levels measured by ELISA. Results: Serum levels of the usually inhibitory soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFaR1) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients at admission to ICU. High serum levels of sTNFaR1 were associated with mortality of severe COVID-19 patients treated within ICU. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates for role of STNF-aR1 receptor in severity of disease. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFaR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Mortaz, E.; Tabarsi, P.; Jamaati, H.; Dalil Roofchayee, N.; KakaDezfuli, N.; Hashemian, S.

Design: Retrospective analysis of the trajectory of reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county. Setting: United States. Participants: Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases. Exposures: Metropolitan designation, Social Deprivation Index (SDI), 2016 Republican Presidential Candidate Victory. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Results: 1023/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66.3%) had increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In univariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had a significantly higher SDI (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0.009). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts. Limitations: The data examines county-level voting patterns and does not account for individual voting behavior, subjecting this work to the potential for ecologic fallacy. Conclusion: Increasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US are likely driven by a combination of social disadvantage, social networks, and behavioral factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will be essential for pandemic control.","Mourad, A.; Turner, N. A.; Baker, A.

88,'Trained immunity' from  Mycobacterium spp. exposure or BCG vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes,"Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown. 'Trained immunity' of the populace as a result of BCG policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning 'trained immunity' has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any correlation. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any mandatory BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of Mycobacterium spp.(including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations is consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections per million population at all the time points evaluated [r(20): -0.5511 to -0.6338; p-value: 0.0118 to 0.0027]. The results indicate that the on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes should consider the inclusion of 'controls' for underlying 'trained immunity' prevalence or that resulting from the intervention (BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions.","Singh, S.; Maurya, R.

For this purpose, we compared viral titers in Vero cells from viral droplets exposed to copper surfaces for 30 min. The copper and copper-nickel surfaces inactivated 99.9% of the viral titer of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. The copper surfaces also inactivated 99% of SARS-CoV-2 titers in 2 hours to close to the limit of detection. These data add Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) to the list of pathogens that can be inactivated by exposure to copper ions, validating Luminore CopperTouch technology (currently the only Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]-registered cold spray antimicrobial surface technology) as an efficacious, cost-friendly tool to improve infection control in hospitals, long-term care facilities, schools, hotels, buses, trains, airports, and other highly trafficked areas.","Mantlo, E.; Paessler, S.; Seregin, A.

90,Effects of environmental factors on severity and mortality of COVID-19,"Background Most respiratory viruses show pronounced seasonality, but for SARS-CoV-2 this still needs to be documented. Methods We examined the disease progression of COVID-19 in 6,911 patients admitted to hospitals in Europe and China. In addition, we evaluated progress of disease symptoms in 37,187 individuals reporting symptoms into the COVID Symptom Study application. Findings Meta-analysis of the mortality risk in eight European hospitals estimated odds ratios per one day increase in the admission date to be 0.981 (0.973-0.988, p<0.001) and per increase in ambient temperature of one degree Celsius to be 0.854 (0.773-0.944, p=0.007). Statistically significant decreases of comparable magnitude in median hospital stay, probability of transfer to Intensive Care Unit and need for mechanical ventilation were also observed in most, but not all hospitals. The analysis of individually reported symptoms of 37,187 individuals in the UK also showed the decrease in symptom duration and disease severity with time. Interpretation Severity of COVID-19 in Europe decreased significantly between March and May and the seasonality of COVID-19 is the most likely explanation. Mucosal barrier and mucociliary clearance can significantly decrease viral load and disease progression, and their inactivation by low relative humidity of indoor air might significantly contribute to severity of the disease.","Kifer, D.; Bugada, D.; Villar-Garcia, J.; Gudelj, I.; Menni, C.; Sudre, C.

91,The competing risk between in-hospital mortality and recovery: A pitfall in COVID-19 survival analysis research,"Background A plethora of studies on COVID-19 investigating mortality and recovery have used the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model without taking into account the presence of competing risks. We investigate, through extensive simulations, the bias in estimating the hazard ratio (HR) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of death when competing risks are ignored, and suggest an alternative method. Methods We simulated a fictive clinical trial on COVID-19 mimicking studies investigating interventions such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. The outcome is time from randomization until death. Six scenarios for the effect of treatment on death and recovery were considered. The HR and the 28-day ARR of death were estimated using the Cox PH and the Fine and Gray (FG) models. Estimates were then compared with the true values, and the magnitude of misestimation was quantified. Results The Cox PH model misestimated the true HR and the 28-day ARR of death in the majority of scenarios. The magnitude of misestimation increased when recovery was faster and/or chance of recovery was higher. In some scenarios, this model has shown a harmful treatment effect when it was beneficial. Estimates obtained from the FG model were all consistent and showed no misestimation or changes in direction. Conclusion There is a substantial risk of misleading results in COVID-19 research if recovery and death due to COVID-19 are not considered as competing risk events. We strongly recommend the use of a competing risk approach to re-analyze relevant published data that have used the Cox PH model.

93,Maternal and perinatal characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies complicated with COVID-19 in Kuwait,"Background: In late December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in the Chinese city Wuhan among a cluster of pneumonia patients. While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ayed, A.; Embaireeg, A.; Benawadth, A.; Al-Fouzan, W.; Hammoud, M.; Alhathal, M.; Alzaydai, A.; Ayed, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150623v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
94,SSRIs and SNRIs and Risk of Death or Intubation in COVID-19: Results from an Observational Study,"Importance: On the grounds of their anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, we hypothesized that SSRIs and SNRIs might be effective treatments for Covid-19. Methods: We examined the association of antidepressant use with intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in time-to-event analyses adjusted for numerous potential confounders. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. Results: Of the 9,509 inpatients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 2,164 patients (22.8%) were excluded because of missing data or exclusion criterion (i.e. less than 18 years old of age). Of the remaining 7,345 adult inpatients, 460 patients (6.3%) received an antidepressant during the hospitalization. The primary endpoint occurred respectively in 143 patients exposed to antidepressants (31.1%) and 1,188 patients who were not (17.3%). After adjusting for the older age [74.8 (SD=15.5) versus 56.8 (SD=19.3); Welch's t-test=23.7; p<0.001] and the greater medical severity of patients receiving antidepressants, the primary analyses showed a significant negative association of the composite endpoint with exposure to any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; p<0.001), SSRIs (HR, 0.56; p<0.001), and SNRIs (HR, 0.57; p=0.034), but not with other antidepressant classes. Exposure to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine was significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.

Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one.

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150) before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a causal link.

To increase the evidence base supporting specific methods to measure social interaction, we compared data from self-reported contact surveys and wearable proximity sensors from a cohort of schoolchildren in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Although the number and type of contacts recorded by each participant differed between the two methods, we found good correspondence between the two methods in aggregate measures of age-specific interactions. Fewer, but longer, contacts were reported in surveys, relative to the generally short proximal interactions captured by wearable sensors. When adjusted for expectations of proportionate mixing, though, the two methods produced highly similar, assortative age-mixing matrices. These aggregate mixing matrices, when used in simulation, resulted in similar estimates of risk of infection by age. While proximity sensors and survey methods may not be interchangeable for capturing individual contacts, they can generate highly correlated data on age-specific mixing patterns relevant to the dynamics of respiratory virus transmission.","Grantz, K.

101,The antibody response to the glycan α-Gal correlates with COVID-19 disease symptoms,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Urra, J.

The viral and cellular mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia are not well understood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.","Buchrieser, J.; Dufloo, J.; Hubert, M.; Monel, B.; Planas, D.; Rajah, M.

Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.","Bayati, A.; Kumar, R.; Francis, V.; McPherson, P.

104,Single-nucleotide conservation state annotation of SARS-CoV-2 genome,"Given the global impact and severity of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mutations. Multi-strain sequence alignments of coronaviruses (CoV) provide important information for interpreting the genome and its variation. We apply a comparative genomics method, ConsHMM, to the multi-strain alignments of CoV to annotate every base of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with conservation states based on sequence alignment patterns among CoV. The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and the state annotations are more predictive than existing genomic annotations in prioritizing bases without non-singleton mutations, which are likely enriched for important genomic bases. We expect the conservation states to be a resource for interpreting the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mutations.","Kwon, S.

105,Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies depicts the evolution of mutation sites amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India,"With the exponential spread of COVID-19 pandemic across the world within the last six months, SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously trying to adapt themselves in their host environment by random mutations. While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential should get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation probability patterns are evolving in 864 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 30 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of four months. Out of these, the mutational probabilities of 25 variants including C14408T (in RdRp gene), A23403G (in spike gene), C6312A (nsp3 gene) are continuously increasing suggesting that these mutations are being propagated with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. In contrast, the mutational probabilities of five variants including C6312A (nsp3 gene), G11083T (nsp6 gene), C28311T (N gene) have significantly decreased in May-June as compared to March-April, suggesting these mutations are being terminated with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","Sharma, G.; Kolte, V.; Hudson B., S.; Khan, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201905v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.201905v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,False
106,Identification of Vulnerable Populations and Areas at Higher Risk of COVID-19 Related Mortality in the U.S.,"Background The role of health-related disparities including sociodemographic, environmental, and critical care capacity in the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly understood. In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.","Correa-Agudelo, E.; Mersha, T.; Hernandez, A.; Branscum, A.

107,Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycan-assisted endocytosis as a COVID-19 therapeutic option,"Drugs capable of blocking the infectious cycle of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to tackle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the viral Spike (S) protein to human ACE2, has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target. Here we use murine leukemia viruses pseudotyped with Spike from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated coronavirus entry can be mitigated by heparin, a heparan sulfate-related glycan, or by genetic ablation of biosynthetic enzymes for the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A drug repurposing screen targeting HSPG-dependent endocytosis identifies pharmacologically active endocytosis inhibitors that also abrogate coronavirus cell entry. Among them, Mitoxantrone (EC50=~10 nM) targets HSPGs directly, whereas Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to impair HSPG-assisted viral entry. Gene expression profiling suggests potential combination regimens that optimally target HSPG-dependent viral entry. Altogether, our study establishes HSPGs as an assisting factor for ACE2 in endocytosis-mediated coronavirus entry and identifies drugs that can be repurposed to target this important stage in the viral life cycle.","Zhang, Q.; Chen, C.; Swaroop, M.; Xu, M.; Wang, L.; Lee, J.; Pradhan, M.; Shen, M.; Luo, Z.; Xu, Y.; Huang, W.; Zheng, W.; Ye, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.202549v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,False
108,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Depends on Cellular Heparan Sulfate and ACE2,"We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its Receptor Binding Domain. Docking studies suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.","Clausen, T. M.; Sandoval, D. R.; Spliid, C.

109,At what times during infection is SARS-CoV-2 detectable and no longer detectable using RT-PCR based tests?: A systematic review of individual participant data,"Background Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral ribonucleic acid (RNA), using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are pivotal to detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and duration of detectable virus indicating potential for infectivity. Methods We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Findings Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Interpretation RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.","Mallett, S.; Allen, J.; Graziadio, S.; Taylor, S. A.; Sakai, N.

110,"Two New Models for Epidemics with Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom","The Distributed Logistic Model and the Adaptive Logistic Model of epidemics are formulated and used to study the course of cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distributed model is designed to account for a spread of initiation times of hot spots across a country; it does especially well at capturing the initial and linear phases of epidemics. The adaptive model accounts for the development of social mitigation factors, and does especially well at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. The historical data for the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. are analyzed in detail. The parameters of the fits to the two models provide complementary information about the pandemic. The initial infection rate constant was r0 {approx} 0.29 per day for each country, and the effective infection rate constants evolved with time in essentially the same way for each. This suggests that mitigation effects were equally effective in all three countries. Analysis with the distributed model suggests that it took somewhat different times T for the epidemic to spread across each country, with T(US) {approx} 50 days significantly greater than the T's of Italy or the U.K. The mortality ratio in the U.S. was about 0.061 while in Italy and U.K. it was much larger at about 0.15.","Roberts, D.

Results In both cases, a frequency peak of one harmonic corresponding to a period of 7.11 days was observed for France and the world. In France, this weekly frequency corresponds to a decrease in deaths every Sunday, whereas for the world the systematic decrease is shifted on average by 1.5 days and corresponds to Saturday or Friday.

112,"Subsequent waves of viral pandemics, a hint for the future course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Background It is unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a second wave. We analysed published data of five influenza pandemics (such as the Spanish Flu and the Swine Flu) and the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic to describe whether there were subsequent waves and how they differed. Methods We reanalysed literature and WHO reports on SARS-CoV-1 and literature on five influenza pandemics. We report frequencies of second and third waves, wave heights, wavelengths and time between subsequent waves. From this, we estimated peak-to-peak ratios to compare the wave heights, and wave-length-to-wave-length ratios to compare the wavelengths differences in days. Furthermore, we analysed the seasonality of the wave peaks and the time between the peak values of two waves. Results Second waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, were usually about the same height and length as first waves and were observed in 93% of the 57 described epidemic events of influenza pandemics and in 42% of the 19 epidemic events of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic. Third waves occurred in 54% of the 28 influenza and in 11% of the 19 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic events. Third waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, usually peaked higher than second waves with a peak-to-peak ratio of 0.5.

114,Staff testing for COVID-19 via an online pre-registration form,"Background: Healthcare workers are at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and potentially causing institutional outbreaks. Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals while also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. Objectives: We aimed to identify (1) specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and (2) staff sectors where enhanced strategies for testing might be required. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Results: Of 799 clients, most were young and female with few comorbidities. The most common occupation was nurses followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared to other staff (median: 1.5 vs 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n=105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, chills and history of fever were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms was more predictive of a positive test, but 12/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. While some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it. Staff testing should form part of a bundle of strategies to protect staff including wearing masks, regular hand washing, buddy screening, physical distancing, availability of PPE and special dispensation for COVID-19-related leave.","Moolla, M.

The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource receives 24-hourly updates from its full electronic health record, including regularly sourced national mortality on all past and present SLaM service users. The SLaM urban catchment has high levels of deprivation and is ethnically diverse, so the objective of the descriptive analyses reported in this manuscript was to compare mortality in SLaM service users from 16th March to 15th May 2020 to that for the same period in 2019 within specific ethnic groups: i) White British, ii) Other White, iii) Black African/Caribbean, iv) South Asian, v) Other, and vi) missing/not stated. For Black African/Caribbean patients (the largest minority ethnic group) this ratio was 3.33, compared to 2.47 for White British patients.

117,The Efficacy of IL-6 Inhibitor Tocilizumab in Reducing Severe COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review,"Without proven, targeted therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19, potentially utilizing existing drugs. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, also called a cytokine storm. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine which drives the cytokine storm and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. 9 case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for a qualitative synthesis. In all of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC and a combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.482 (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.326-0.713). Additionally, 12 uncontrolled trials were identified for a qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 13.6%.

119,Development of a severity of disease score and classification model by machine learning for hospitalized COVID-19 patients,"BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression.

120,COVID-19 scenarios for the United States,"The United States (US) has not been spared in the ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease. COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.","IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team,; Hay, S.

121,Low-Dose Whole-Lung Radiation for COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: Safety of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19 pneumonia has been established in two phase I trials. By focally dampening pulmonary cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve outcomes in hospitalized and oxygen-dependent COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or at least until hospital discharge, and compared to an age- and comorbidity-matched control cohort. COVID-19-positive patients eligible for this protocol were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, and serologic responses. Results: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared to ten matched control patients, of whom six received COVID-directed therapy. Median time to clinical recovery was 12 days for the control cohort vs 3 days for LD-RT (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 and 12 days, p=0.19), and intubation rates (40% and 10%, p=0.12) were shorter for the LD-RT cohort. The LD-RT cohort had faster radiographic improvement (p=0.03), even among patients with high COVID burden. Serologic recovery in specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, and inflammatory markers occurred more rapidly following LD-RT than among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including a 3-fold risk reduction in time to clinical improvement, were observed following LD-RT compared to matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the global availability of radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts to investigate the optimal role of LD-RT in COVID-19 pneumonia are justified.

122,Efficacy of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background The antimalarial agents, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) show promising SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral activity in vitro; however, clinical studies have reported conflicting results. We sought to systematically evaluate the effect of CQ and HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZ) on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published through July 7, 2020. We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, preprints and grey literature. We included studies that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without AZ. We pooled only adjusted effect estimates of mortality using a random effect model and estimated between studies heterogeneity using I2 statistic. We summarized the effect of CQ or HCQ on viral clearance and ICU admission/ mechanical ventilation. Results Out of 1463 citations screened for eligibility, five RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included (20,263 patients, all hospitalized but with a variable disease severity spectrum). Thirteen studies (1 RCT and 12 cohorts) with 19,573 patients examined the effect of HCQ on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted OR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.96-1.15, I2=0 %, p=0.647). Six cohort studies examined the effect of HCQ and AZ combination among 3430 patients. After excluding a study that examined only patients with cancers, the pooled adjusted OR was (1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.34, I2=0.0%). Two cohort studies and three RCTs found no significant effect of HCQ on viral clearance. One RCT with 48 patients demonstrated improved viral clearance in patients treated with CQ and HCQ. Three cohort studies found that HCQ with or without AZ had no significant effect on mechanical ventilation/ ICU admission. Conclusion Moderate certainty evidence suggests that HCQ, with or without AZ, lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings are consistent with the recommendations from medical societies that HCQ should only be used to treat COVID-19 patients in the context of clinical trials. Trials of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis are ongoing.","Kashour, Z. T.; Riaz, M.; garbati, M.; Aldosary, O.; Tlayjeh, H.; Gerber, D.; Murad, M. H.; Sohail, M. R.; Kashour, T.; Tleyjeh, I.

123,The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China,"Objectives The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China remains unknown. To reveal the missing information, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang of China. Design Cross-sectional study Setting Three blood centers, located in the central, south and north China, respectively, recruiting from January to April 2020. Participants 38,144 healthy blood donors donated in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang were enrolled, who were all met the criteria for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Main outcome measures Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including total antibody (TAb), IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (IgG-RBD) and nucleoprotein (IgG-N), and IgM. Pseudotype lentivirus-based neutralization test was performed on all TAb-positive samples. In addition, anonymous personal demographic information, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation and educational level, and blood type were collected. Results A total of 519 samples from 410 donors were confirmed by neutralization tests. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors was 2.29% (407/17,794, 95%CI: 2.08% to 2.52%) in Wuhan, 0.029% (2/6,810, 95%CI: 0.0081% to 0.11%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0074% (1/13,540, 95%CI: 0.0013% to 0.042%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. The earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in blood donors was identified on January 20, 2020 in Wuhan. The weekly prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Wuhan's blood donors changed dynamically and were 0.08% (95%CI: 0.02% to 0.28%) during January 15 to 22 (before city lockdown), 3.08% (95%CI: 2.67% to 3.55%) during January 23 to April 7 (city quarantine period) and 2.33% (95%CI: 2.06% to 2.63%) during April 8 to 30 (after lockdown easing). Female and older-age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among donors in Wuhan. Conclusions The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China was low, even in Wuhan city. According to our data, the earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan's donors should not earlier than January, 2020. As most of the population of China remained uninfected during the early wave of COVID-19 pandemic, effective public health measures are still certainly required to block viral spread before a vaccine is widely available.","Chang, L.; Hou, W.; Zhao, L.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Wu, L.; Xu, T.; Wang, L.; Wang, J.; Ma, J.; Wang, L.; Zhao, J.; Xu, J.; Dong, J.; Yan, Y.; Yang, R.; Li, Y.; Guo, F.; Cheng, W.; Su, Y.; Zeng, J.; Han, W.; Cheng, T.; Zhang, J.; Yuan, Q.; Ningshao, X.; Wang, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153106v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153106v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
124,Clinical Ordering Practices of the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test at a Large Academic Medical Center,"Background: The novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 originated in December 2019 and has now infected over 3 million people in the United States. In Spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite lacking evidence-based guidance. Objective: To describe clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, including cost implications, immediately following testing availability. Design: Retrospective chart review of patients who received antibody testing from May 14, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Setting: A large academic medical center, one of the first in the US to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians. Patients: 447 consecutive patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Measurements: Clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, cost implications, and comparison with current expert-based guidance from the IDSA and CDC. Results: Of 444 individual antibody test results meeting inclusion criteria, the two most commonly described indications for ordering the antibody test, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n=223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19 compatible illness (n=105) with no previous molecular testing and in asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure or contact with a person with COVID-19 compatible illness (n=60). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (p<0.0001) among those indications inconsistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance. Total cost estimates ranged from $57,720 to $97,680, of which 42% was for testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance. Limitations: The duration of antibody response following infection is unclear and asymptomatic individuals may not develop a positive antibody response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these two groups. Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs.","Wiencek, J. R.; Head, C. L.; Sifri, C.

125,Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19,"Introduction There is a concern that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) induced hypochlorhydria could potentially predispose to severe COVID-19. Methods We studied the association between prehospitalization PPI use and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results In our study, 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPI. Mortality among PPI-users was 2.3 times higher than non-users, along with 2.5 times higher risk of mechanical ventilation. This relationship existed even after adjusting for confounding variables. Discussion These results warrant further investigation to evaluate if PPI-induced hypochlorhydria is associated with a higher risk of GI symptoms and worse outcomes because of the omnipresence of ACE-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.","Ramachandran, P.; Perisetti, A.; Gajendran, M.; Jean-Louise, F.; Dwivedi, A.

126,Public Opinions towards COVID-19 in California and New York on Twitter,"Background: With the pandemic of COVID-19 and the release of related policies, discussions about the COVID-19 are widespread online. Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with ""protective measures"" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states. Conclusions: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences.","Wang, X.; Zou, C.; Xie, Z.; Li, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151936v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151936v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
127,Complexity signatures in the COVID-19 epidemic: power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves,"We apply a versatile growth model, whose rate of change is given by a generalised beta distribution, to describe the complex behaviour of the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries in Europe and Asia. We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the death toll but also the risk of resurgence.","Vasconcelos, G. L.; Macedo, A. M.

128,The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) systematically underestimates the risk of in-hospital mortality in unplanned COVID-19 admissions to hospital.,"Background: Although the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its latest version NEWS2 are recommended for monitoring for deterioration in patients admitted to hospital, little is known about their performance in COVID-19 patients. We analysed the performance of National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Adult non-elective admissions discharged between 11-March-2020 to 13-June-2020 with an index NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours of admission are used to predict mortality at four time points (in-hospital, 24hours, 48hours, and 72hours) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 admissions. Results: Out of 6480 non-elective admissions, 620 (9.6%) had a diagnosis of COVID-19. They were older (73.3 vs 67.7yrs), more often male (54.7% vs 50.1%), had higher index NEWS (4 vs 2.5) and NEWS2 (4.6 vs 2.8) scores and higher in-hospital mortality (32.1% vs 5.8%). The c-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 admissions was significantly lower using NEWS (0.64 vs 0.74) or NEWS2 (0.64 vs 0.74), however these differences reduced at 72hours (NEWS: 0.75 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.71 vs 0.81), 48 hours (NEWS: 0.78 vs 0.81; NEWS2: 0.76 vs 0.82) and 24hours (NEWS: 0.84 vs 0.84; NEWS2: 0.86 vs 0.84). Increasing NEWS2 values reflected increased mortality, but for any given value the absolute risk was on average 24% higher (e.g.NEWS2=5: 36% vs 9%). Interpretation: NEWS2 is a valid predictor of the mortality risk but substantially underestimates the absolute mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

129,Novel surrogate virus neutralization test reveals low serum neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies levels in mildly affected COVID-19 convalescents,"Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into cells using surface-expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We developed a surrogate neutralization test (sVNT) to assess at what degree serum antibodies interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD to ACE2. The sVNT revealed neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies in the sera of 90% of mildly and 100% of severely affected coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients. Importantly, sVNT results correlated strongly to the results from pseudotyped-vesicular stomatitis virus-vector-based neutralization assay and to levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies. Moreover, levels of neutralizing antibodies also correlated to duration and severity of clinical symptoms, but not patient age or gender. These findings together with the sVNT will not only be important for evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in a population but also for identifying promising plasma donors for successful passive antibody therapy.","Bosnjak, B.; Stein, S.

130,"Interest in COVID-19 vaccine trials participation among young adults in China: Willingness, reasons for hesitancy, and demographic and psychosocial determinants","Background: With the demand for rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and evaluation, this paper aimed to describe the prevalence and correlates of willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among university students in China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 1,912 Chinese university students was conducted during March and April 2020. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with willingness to participate. Results: The majority of participants (64.01%) indicated willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Hesitancy over signing informed consent documents, concerns over time necessary for participating in a medical study, and perceived COVID-19 societal stigma were identified as deterrents, whereas lower socioeconomic status, female gender, perception of likely COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and COVID-19 prosocial behaviors were facilitative factors. Further, public health mistrust and hesitancy over signing informed consent documents had a significant interactive effect on vaccine trial willingness. Conclusions: High standards of ethical and scientific practice are needed in COVID-19 vaccine research, including providing potential participants full and accurate information and ensuring participation free of coercion, socioeconomic inequality, and stigma. Attending to the needs of marginalized groups and addressing psychosocial factors including stigma and public health mistrust may also be important to COVID-19 vaccine development and future uptake.","Sun, S.; Lin, D.; Operario, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152678v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

Using linked patient-level data, we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and/or related mortality. Methods A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition. Findings A total of 5,664,652 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70 years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied (autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes. Interpretation There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.","Burn, E.; Tebe, C.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Aragon, M.; Recalde, M.; Roel, E.; Prats-Uribe, A.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Duarte-Salles, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152454v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

134,Evaluation of the Practicability of a Finger-Stick Whole-Blood SARS-Cov-2 Self-Test Adapted for the General Population.,"Background COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood and easily usable by the general population are needed in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO RDT and the results have been submitted for publication and are currently under review. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by common folk in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use Methods 142 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plants workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use with or without a tutorial video was made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users ability to read the results. Results 88.4 % of the test users judged the instruction for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3 % of the users obtained a valid results and according to the supervisors 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the user. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback toward the COVID PRESTO as a potential self-test. No influence of age and education was observed. Conclusion COVID-PRESTO was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its utilization was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing a promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This RDT can become an easy-to-use tool to help know whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the perspective of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.","prazuck, t.; Phan Van, J.; sinturel, F.; levray, f.; Elie, A.; Camera, D.; Pialloux, g.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152660v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152660v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
135,Impact of COVID-19 on 2020 US life expectancy for the Black and Latino populations,"The Black and Latino populations have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and risk of death for those infected. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, as of July 4, 2020, deaths to Black and Latino individuals comprised 23% and 17%, respectively, of the approximately 115,000 COVID-19 deaths. COVID-19 mortality is likely to result in a larger decline in life expectancy during 2020 than the US has experienced for decades as well as a particularly large reduction for Black and Latino individuals. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 for 2020, by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths-one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our most likely estimate indicates a reduction in life expectancy at birth greater than 1.5 years for both the Black and Latino populations, which is one year larger than the reduction for whites. This would imply that the Black-white gap would increase by 30%, from 3.6 to 4.7 years, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2008 and reversing an overall trend of steeper mortality declines among the Black population since the early 1990s. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their survival advantage decline by 36%, equivalent to its magnitude in 2006.","Andrasfay, T.; Goldman, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20148387v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20148387v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

137,"Quantification of the South African Lockdown Regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, and the Levels of Immunity They Require to Work","This research quantifies the various South African lockdown regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in terms of the basic reproduction number, r0. It further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work, then predicts their perceived values, should infections have been underestimated by a factor of 10. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be 3.16, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","Childs, S.

138,Development of a data-driven COVID-19 prognostication tool to inform triage and step-down care for hospitalised patients in Hong Kong: A population based cohort study,"Abstract Background: This is the first study on prognostication in an entire cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the city of Hong Kong. Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. Methods: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1,037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. Results: The 1,037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD {+/-} 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro- and micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%-91.3% and 96.0%-95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%-94.2% and 97.8%-97.1% under Day-5 model. as compared to 94.2%, 95.0%-97.1% and 98.3%-98.6% under Day-5 model. Conclusions: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome. The model is transformed into a simple online calculator to provide convenient clinical reference tools at the point of care, with an aim to inform clinical decision on triage and step-down care.

139,Municipality- level predictors of COVID-19 mortality in Mexico: a cautionary tale,"Background. Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico. Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported. Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000). Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions.

This was more than twice the number of deaths reported in the next most severely impacted country. We jointly modelled the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We used changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nationally, we estimated 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the population had been infected by 1st June 2020, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious. We also demonstrated that good model forecasts of deaths for the next 3 weeks with low error and good coverage of our credible intervals.","Unwin, H. J. T.; Mishra, S.; Bradley, V.

141,Quantifying Respiratory Airborne Particle Dispersion Control Through Improvised Reusable Masks,"Objective: To determine the effectiveness of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings in controlling airborne dispersion from exhalation (both droplet and aerosol), and to aid in establishing public health strategies on the wearing of masks to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Design: This comparative effectiveness study using an exhalation simulator to conduct 94 experiment runs with combinations of 8 different fabrics, 5 mask designs, and airflows for both talking and coughing. Setting: Non-airtight fume hood and multiple laser scattering particle sensors. Participants: No human participants. Exposure: 10% NaCl nebulized solution delivered by an exhalation simulator through various masks and fabrics with exhalation airflows representative of ""coughing"" and ""talking or singing."" Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was reduction in aerosol dispersion velocity, quantity of particles, and change in dispersion direction. Measurements used in this study included peak expiratory flow (PEF), aerosol velocity, concentration area under curve (AUC), and two novel metrics of expiratory flow dispersion factor (EDF) and filtration efficiency indicator (FEI). Results: Three-way multivariate analysis of variance establishes that factors of fabric, mask design, and exhalation breath level have a statistically significant effect on changing direction, reducing velocity or concentration (Fabric: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Mask design: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .000; Breath level: P = < .001, Wilks' {Lambda} = .004). There were also statistically significant interaction effects between combinations of all primary factors. Conclusions and Relevance: The application of facial coverings or masks can significantly reduce the airborne dispersion of aerosolized particles from exhalation. The results show that wearing of non-medical grade washable masks or face coverings can help increase the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) especially where infectious contaminants may exist in shared air spaces. However, the effectiveness varies greatly between the specific fabrics and mask designs used.","Edwards, N.

142,Pericarditis and myocarditis long after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a cross-sectional descriptive study in health-care workers,"Background: Cardiac sequelae of past SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly documented. We conducted a cross-sectional study in health-care workers to report evidence of pericarditis and myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We studied 139 health-care workers with confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection (103 diagnosed by RT-PCR and 36 by serology). Participants underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, laboratory tests including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Pericarditis was diagnosed when classical criteria were present, and the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on the updated CMR Lake-Louise-Criteria. Results: Median age was 52 years (IQR 41-57), 100 (72%) were women, and 23 (16%) were previously hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. At examination (10.4 [9.3-11.0] weeks after infection-like symptoms), all participants presented hemodynamic stability. Chest pain, dyspnoea or palpitations were observed in 58 (42%) participants; electrocardiographic abnormalities in 69 (50%); NT-pro-BNP was elevated in 11 (8%); troponin in 1 (1%); and CMR abnormalities in 104 (75%). Isolated pericarditis was diagnosed in 4 (3%) participants, myopericarditis in 15 (11%) and isolated myocarditis in 36 (26%). Participants diagnosed by RT-PCR were more likely to still present symptoms than participants diagnosed by serology (73 [71%] vs 18 [50%]; p=0.027); nonetheless, the prevalence of pericarditis or myocarditis was high in both groups (44 [43%] vs 11 [31%]; p=0.238). Most participants (101 [73%]) showed altered immune cell counts in blood, particularly decreased eosinophil (37 [27%]; p<0.001) and increased CD4-CD8-/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (24 [17%]; p<0.001). Pericarditis was associated with elevated CD4-CD8-/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (p=0.011), while participants diagnosed with myopericarditis or myocarditis had lower (p<0.05) plasmacytoid dendritic cell, NK-cell and plasma cell counts and lower anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels (p=0.027). Conclusions: Pericarditis and myocarditis with clinical stability are frequent long after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in presently asymptomatic subjects. These observations will probably apply to the general population infected and may indicate that cardiac sequelae might occur late in association with an altered (delayed) innate and adaptative immune response.","Eiros, R.; Barreiro-Perez, M.; Martin-Garcia, A.; Almeida, J.; Villacorta, E.; Perez-Pons, A.; Merchan, S.; Torres-Valle, A.; Sanchez-Pablo, C.; Gonzalez-Calle, D.; Perez-Escurza, O.; Toranzo, I.; Diaz-Pelaez, E.; Fuentes-Herrero, B.; Macias-Alvarez, L.; Oliva-Ariza, G.; Lecrevisse, Q.; Fluxa, R.; Bravo-Grandez, J.

143,Antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 are distinct in children with MIS-C compared to adults with COVID-19,"Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.","Weisberg, S.

144,Multidisciplinary approach to COVID-19 risk communication: A framework and tool for individual and regional risk assessment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded over ten million cases globallywith no vaccine available yet. Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from anywhere.","Parajuli, R.

People's awareness and knowledge of, and behavior and attitude toward COVID-19 are scarcely investigated , making medical literature related to this point poor. we aim to measure the knowledge of, and the reaction to COVID-19 among University of Aleppo students in Syria, and the determinants of their awareness and behavior regarding this disease. Materials and Methods: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, that was conducted from 21st March to 30 March 2020. We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics ,knowledge and behaviours . Every participant's knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people -which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases. Conclusion: Junior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses. Finally, we should be aware of the negative impact of quarantine on public health to take it into consideration for current campaigns and future policies.","alhamid, a. m.; Alhamid, A.

146,"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Policy on Homicide, Suicide, and Motor Vehicle Deaths in Peru","Introduction: Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","Calderon-Anyosa, R.

Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality,1 and COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and non-pregnant women.2 We present a case of placental SARS-CoV-2 virus in a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy and mild COVID-19 disease. Methods: A pregnant woman was evaluated at University of Missouri Women and Childrens Hospital. Institutional review board approval was obtained; information was obtained from medical records. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. A gynecological pathologist examined the placenta and performed histolopathology. Sections were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; slides were cut and subjected to hematoxylin-and-eosin or immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. IHC was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. Findings: A 29 year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias two days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her parents were in self-isolation for COVID-19 positivity; husband was asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19, but exposed to a workplace (meatpacking facility) outbreak. Prenatal course was uncomplicated, with no gestational hypertension. She was afebrile and asymptomatic with normal vital signs throughout hospitalization. Her myalgias improved prior to admission. A liveborn male infant was delivered vaginally. Newborn course was uneventful; he was appropriate for gestational age, physical was unremarkable, and he was discharged home at 36 hours. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative at 24 hours. At one-week follow-up, newborn was breastfeeding well, with no fevers or respiratory distress. Overall placental histology is consistent with acute uterine hypoxia (subchorionic laminar necrosis) superimposed on chronic uterine hypoxia (extra-villous trophoblasts and focal chronic villitis). IHC using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-specific monoclonal antibody demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antigens throughout the placenta in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and rarely in CK7-expressing trophoblasts. Negative control placenta (November 2019 delivery) and ferret nasal turbinate tissues (not shown) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: In this report, SARS-CoV-2 was found in the placenta, but newborn was COVID-19 negative. Our case shows maternal vascular malperfusion, with no features of fetal vascular malperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental COVID-19 despite mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy (with no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); specifically, this patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her having mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for possible placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and other pregnancy complications) as well as for potential vertical transmission -- especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. Further studies are urgently needed, to determine whether women with mild, pre-symptomatic, or asymptomatic COVID-19 may have SARS-CoV-2 virus that can cross the placenta, cause fetal vascular malperfusion, and possibly affect the fetus. This raises important public health and public policy questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing on a regular basis throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, A.

148,"Stress, burnout and depression in women in health care during COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Scoping Review","ABSTRACT Objectives The overall objectives of this rapid scoping review are to (a) synthesize the common triggers of stress, burnout, and depression faced by women in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) identify individual-, organizational-, and systems-level interventions that can support the well-being of women HCWs during a pandemic. Design This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from 2003 until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Interventions We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. Primary and secondary outcome measures Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. Results Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Conclusions Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.

149,Modelling suggests blood group incompatibility may substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Several independent datasets suggest blood type A is over-represented and type O under-represented among COVID-19 patients. Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient. Comparison of model outputs to published data on COVID-19 prevalence indicates that if this scenario holds true, ABO incompatibility may reduce virus transmissibility by 60% or more. Paradoxically, however, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A or ""super-spreader"" type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity amongst the remaining susceptible individuals. I stress that these results illustrate a theoretical model of ABO blood group interaction with virus transmission and require confirmation by observation.","Ellis, P.

150,Discrete simulation analysis of COVID-19 and prediction of isolation bed numbers,"Background. The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods. We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the reasonable number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. Results. Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease cure time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease cure time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P * (-0.273 + 0.009I +0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) * (1+V).","Li, X.; Cai, Y.; Ding, Y.; Li, J.-d.; Huang, G.; Liang, Y.; Xu, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152330v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152330v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
151,The effect of international travel restrictions on internal spread of COVID-19,"Background: Countries have restricted international arrivals to delay the spread of COVID-19. These measures carry a high economic and social cost. They may have little impact on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared to imported cases. Methods: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we compared the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to the expected COVID-19 cases arising from internal spread on an average day in May 2020 in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. Findings: With May 2019 travel volumes, imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 103 (95% credible interval: 76 - 130) out of 142 countries, and <1% in 48 (95% CrI: 9 - 95). If we assume that travel would decrease compared to May 2019 even in the absence of formal restrictions, then imported cases account for <10% of total incidence in 109-123 countries and <1% in 61-88 countries (depending on the assumptions about travel reductions). Interpretation: While countries can expect infected travellers to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions, in most countries these imported cases likely contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions may have limited impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries.","Russell, T.

152,Predictive performance of international COVID-19 mortality forecasting models,"Forecasting models have provided timely and critical information about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, predicting both the timing of peak mortality, and the total magnitude of mortality, which can guide health system response and resource allocation. Out-of-sample predictive validation--checking how well past versions of forecasting models predict subsequently observed trends--provides insight into future model performance. As data and models are updated regularly, a publicly available, transparent, and reproducible framework is needed to evaluate them in an ongoing manner. We reviewed 384 published and unpublished COVID-19 forecasting models, and evaluated seven models for which publicly available, multi-country, and date-versioned mortality estimates could be downloaded. These included those modeled by: DELPHI-MIT (Delphi), Youyang Gu (YYG), the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Imperial College London (Imperial), and three models produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a curve fit model (IHME-CF), a hybrid curve fit and epidemiological compartment model (IHME-CF SEIR), and a hybrid mortality spline and epidemiological compartment model (IHME - MS SEIR). Collectively models covered 171 countries, as well as the 50 states of the United States, and Washington, D.C., and accounted for >99% of all reported COVID-19 deaths on July 11th, 2020. As expected, errors in mortality predictions increased with a larger number of weeks of extrapolation. For the most recent models, released in June, at four weeks of forecasting the best performing model was the IHME-MS SEIR model, with a cumulative median absolute percent error of 6.4%, followed by YYG (6.5%) and LANL (8.0%). Looking across models, errors in cumulative mortality predictions were highest in sub-Saharan Africa and lowest in high-income countries, reflecting differences in data availability and prediction difficulty in earlier vs. later stages of the epidemic. For peak timing prediction, among models released in April, median absolute error values at six weeks ranged from 23 days for the IHME-CF model to 36 days for the YYG model. In sum, we provide a publicly available dataset and evaluation framework for assessing the predictive validity of COVID-19 mortality forecasts. We find substantial variation in predictive performance between models, and note large differences in average predictive validity between regions, highlighting priority areas for further study in sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging-epidemic contexts.","Friedman, J.; Liu, P.; Gakidou, E.; IHME COVID-19 Model Comparison Team,","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151233v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151233v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True
153,PROJECTING A MATURE EPIDEMIC: A SIMPLE TOOL WITH AN APPLICATION TO COVID-19 DEATHS,"We describe a new statistical model for the spread of a mature epidemic, i.e. one characterized by an exponentially decaying growth rate of the cumulative number of cases/deaths - the speed of this decay being measured by the growth rate's half-life. If such a pattern is observed during the recent past, then it can be extrapolated. A spreadsheet is made available that allows users to input weekly cumulative numbers of deaths and obtain an estimate of the growth rate's baseline half-life and the corresponding projections. These projections can be compared to those with a larger half-life (if a protracted epidemic is expected, e.g. due to second wave), or with a smaller one (if successful therapies or mitigation efforts reduce transmission).

154,Assessing required SARS-CoV-2 blanket testing rates for possible control of the outbreak in the epicentre Lusaka province of Zambia with consideration for asymptomatic individuals: a simple mathematical modelling study.,"Abstract. Introduction: The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained blanket testing rate of [&ge;] 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of [&ge;] 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of [&ge;] 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion: Our model predicts that the current testing rates of {approx} 150/100,000 population are inadequate to control transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in Lusaka. Active isolation of COVID-19 cases including asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia.

155,Longitudinal symptom dynamics of COVID-19 infection in primary care,"Importance: Data regarding the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection is rapidly accumulating. However, most studies thus far are based on hospitalized patients and lack longitudinal follow up. As the majority of COVID-19 cases are not hospitalized, prospective studies of symptoms in the population presenting to primary care are needed. Objective: To assess the longitudinal dynamic of clinical symptoms in non-hospitalized individuals prior to and throughout the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: From 1/3/2020 to 07/06/2020, information on symptoms from either surveys or primary care visits was available for 206,377 individuals, including 2,471 who tested positive for COVID-19. Data were extracted from electronic health records (EHR) of the second largest Health Maintenance Organization in Israel, consisting of both results of PCR tests and symptoms recorded by primary care physicians, and linked longitudinal self reported symptoms. Exposures: Diagnosis of COVID-19 disease was made by PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Longitudinal prevalence of clinical symptoms Results: In adults, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in EHR were cough (11.6%), fever (10.3%), and myalgia (7.7%) and the most prevalent self-reported symptoms were cough (21%), fatigue (19%) and rhinorrhea and/or nasal congestion (17%). In children, the most prevalent symptoms recorded in the EHR were fever (7%), cough (5.5%) and abdominal pain (2.4%). Emotional disturbances were documented in 15.9% of the positive adults and 4.2% of the children. Loss of taste and smell, either self-reported or documented by a physician, 3 weeks prior to testing, were the most discriminative symptoms in adults (OR =11.18 and OR=5.47 respectively). Additional symptoms included self reported confusion (OR =4.02), and fatigue (OR = 1.73) and a documentation of syncope, rhinorrhea (OR = 2.09 for both ) and fever (OR= 1.62 ) by a physician. Mean time to recovery was 23.5 +- 9.9 days. Children had a significantly shorter disease duration (21.7 +- 8.8 days, p-value=0.01). Several symptoms, including fatigue, myalgia, runny nose and shortness of breath were reported weeks after recovery. Conclusions and Relevance: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly worldwide, obtaining accurate information on symptoms and their progression is of essence. Our study shed light on the full clinical spectrum of symptoms experienced by infected individuals in primary care, and may alert physicians for the possibility of COVID-19 infection.","Mizrahi, B.; Shilo, S.; Rossman, H.; Kalkstein, N.; Marcus, K.; Barer, Y.; Keshet, A.; Shamir-Stein, N.; Shalev, V.; Ekka Zohar, A.; Chodick, G.; Segal, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151795v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.20151795v1?rss=1,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,,True

157,Effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection,"The retrospective analysis of clinical data of patients suffering from COVID-19 has indicated that statin therapy, used to lower plasma cholesterol levels, is associated with a better clinical outcome. We therefore investigated the effect of statins on SARS-CoV-2 infection and found that selective statins reduced SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and inhibited high and low pathogenic coronavirus infection in human cells. A retrospective study on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 implies that reduced high density lipoprotein levels, which are typically counteracted by statin therapy, are associated with aggravated disease outcome. These results suggest that statin therapy poses no additional risk to individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and that some statins may have a mild beneficial effect on COVID-19 outcome.","Moeller, R.; Zapatero-Belinchon, F.

158,Modulating the transcriptional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 as an effective method for developing antiviral compounds,"To interfere with the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on restoring the transcriptional response induced by infection. Utilizing expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we identified a region in gene expression space that was unique to virus infection and inversely proportional to the transcriptional footprint of known compounds characterized in the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures. Here we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional landscape. These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus. RNA-Seq profiling implicated the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the underlying mechanism of inhibition and suggested that targeting this aspect of host biology may significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.","Hoagland, D.

159,"Tobacco, but not nicotine and flavor-less electronic cigarettes, induces ACE2 and immune dysregulation","COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has infected millions worldwide. This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig/smoking.","Lee, A. C.; Chakladar, J.; Li, W.

160,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG from severely ill COVID-19 patients promotes macrophage hyper-inflammatory responses,"For yet unknown reasons, severely ill COVID-19 patients often become critically ill around the time of activation of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail. Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk.

161,Empirical non-linear modeling & forecast of global daily deaths of COVID-19 pandemic & evidence that a third wave is beginning to decay,"Objectives: The present COVID-19 pandemic (C19P) is challenging our socities all over the world. In this work, based on massive health information daily updated, the C19P daily death numbers at a global level, are modelled, analyzed and forecasted.

Methods: Two empirical models are proposed to explain daily death (DD) records: a) self-similar (SS) recurrences of the global responses, and b) geometric averaging of two independent SS models for global DD records.

Findings: The detected self-similar recurrences in the global response suggest three global self-similar waves that support multi-month forecasts of the DD numbers. However, there are upper and lower-limit SS forecast DD scenarios that were jointly integrated with a geometrical average (GA) model, that support the existence of a moderated third wave, with a decaying stage for the next months (July-September 2020). It appears that the third world (South America [SAM]+Asia [ASI] +Africa [AFR]), is the actual big player, (following China, and Europe [EUR]+North America [NAM]) with its biggest contribution to a global third wave (W3) of C19P.

Conclusion: The empirical global modeling of the C19P has suggested us a possible moderated W3 scenario, with contributions mainly coming from the third world people.

162,PT150 is a modulator of glucocorticoid and androgen receptors with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.,"PT150 is a clinical stage molecule, taken orally, with a strong safety profile having completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for its original use as an anti-depressant. It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 M. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Theise, N.

163,Cold sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain,"The impact of COVID-19 and the urgency to develop a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be overstated. The viral fusion spike (S) protein ectodomain is the primary target for vaccine development. Here we report an unexpected cold sensitivity of a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain construct currently being widely used for immunogen design. We found that when stored at 22 or 37 {degrees}C for 1 week, the S-protein displayed well-ordered trimeric spikes by negative stain electron microscopy. However, storage at 4 {degrees}C reduced the trimeric spikes to <10%, accompanied by decreased stability and enhanced exposure of the ACE-2 receptor binding site. Well-formed S particles could be recovered from cold-stored samples by a brief incubation at 37 {degrees}C. Our results will have broad impact on structural, functional and vaccine studies using the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain.

164,Single-cell analysis reveals the function of lung progenitor cells in COVID-19 patients,"The high mortality of severe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is mainly caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barriers, pulmonary edema and consequently inflammatory tissue damage. Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process1. Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration. Altogether this work uncovered the mechanism that how various lung progenitor cells work in concert to prevent and replenish alveoli loss post severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zuo, W.; Zhao, Z.; Zhao, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, X.; Zhang, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200188v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.200188v1?rss=1,2020-07-13,2020-07-13,,False
165,Identifying Key Determinants of SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 Tight Interaction,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of Covid-19, has fired up a global pandemic. The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","Ngo, V.

166,Worldwide Geographical and Temporal Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Haplotypes shows Differential Distribution Patterns,"Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has been sequenced with unprecedented speed around the world and deposited in several databases. This marks a unique opportunity to study how a virus spread and evolve in a worldwide context. However, currently there is not a useful haplotype classification system to help tracking the virus evolution. Here we identified eleven mutations with 10 % or more frequency in a data set of 7848 genomes. Using these mutations, we identified 6 SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes or OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit) that correlate well with a phylogenomic tree. After that, we analyzed the geographical and temporal distribution of these OTUs, as well as their correlation with patient status. Our geographical analysis showed different OTUs prevalence between continents and the temporal distribution analysis revealed an evolution-like pattern in SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we observed a homogenous distribution of OTUs in mild and severe patients and a great prevalence of OTU 2 in asymptomatic patients. However, genomes in the asymptomatic category, comes from isolates on three consecutive days in February (15 to 17), weakening this observation and highlighting the need to increase genomic analyzes in asymptomatic and severe patients. Our classification system is phylogenetically consistent and allows us to easily track geographic and temporal distribution of important mutations around the world. In the next months, it could be updated using similar steps that we used here.","Justo Arevalo, S.; Zapata Sifuentes, D.; Huallpa Robles, C.; Landa Bianchi, G.; Castillo Chavez, A.; Garavito-Salini Casas, R.; Uceda-Campos, G.; Pineda Chavarria, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199414v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199414v1?rss=1,2020-07-13,2020-07-13,,False
167,Comparisons of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and those of other betacoronaviruses,"The genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is most closely related to viral metagenomes isolated from bats and, more distantly, pangolins. All are of sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus. We have unravelled their recombinational and mutational histories. All showed clear evidence of recombination, most events involving the 3 half of the genomes. The 5 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free, and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13, and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago, and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely. Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3, the S gene and ORF 8 gene. Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes, however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection. A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al., 2020), and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it, and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.","Rodriguez-Roman, E.; Gibbs, A.

Here, we are using in silico modelling of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 protein structures as deposited on the Protein Databank (PDB). We study their flexibility, rigidity and mobility, an important first step in trying to ascertain their dynamics for further drug-related docking studies. We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics.

170,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in England during May 2020: REACT study,"Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K.

We found that neutralizing activity increased with time post symptom onset (PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having neutralizing titers of at least 160 was ~93% (PRNT50) and ~54% (PRNT90).

172,"Clinical utility of targeted SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to aid the diagnosis and management of suspected missed, late or post-COVID-19 infection syndromes: results from a pilot service","Objectives: Determine indications and clinical utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing in adults and children. Design: Prospective evaluation of initial three weeks of a daily Monday to Friday pilot SARS-CoV-2 serology service for patients. Setting: Early post 'first-wave' SARS-CoV-2 transmission period at single centre London teaching hospital that provides care to the local community, as well as regional and national referral pathways for specialist services. Participants: 110 (72 adults, 38 children, age range 0-83 years, 52.7% female (n=58)). Interventions: Patient serum from vetted referrals tested on CE marked and internally validated lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with result and clinical interpretation provided to the direct care team. Main outcome measures: Performance characteristics, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly the benefit for clinical decision-making. Results: The LFIA was deemed suitable for clinical advice and decision making following evaluation with 310 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients and 300 pre-pandemic samples, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. For the pilot, 115 referrals were received leading to 113 tests performed on 108 participants (sample not available for two participants); paediatrics (n=35), medicine (n=69), surgery (n=2) and general practice (n=2). 43.4% participants (n=49) had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There were three main indications for serology; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 infection e.g. PIMS-TS (n=26) and pulmonary embolism (n=5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent compatible illness (n=40), and making infection control and immunosuppression treatment decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n=6). Conclusions: This study shows acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of a SARS-CoV-2 serology service using a rapid, inexpensive and portable assay for adults and children presenting with a range of clinical indications. Results correlated closely with a confirmatory in-house ELISA. The study showed the benefit of introducing a serology service where there is a reasonable pre-test probability, and the result can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience thus far is that the volume of requests from hospital referral routes are manageable within existing clinical and laboratory services; however, the demand from community referrals has not yet been assessed. Given recent evidence for a rapid decline in antibodies, particularly following mild infection, there is likely a limited window of opportunity to realise the benefit of serology testing for individuals infected during the 'first-wave' before they potentially fall below a measurable threshold. Rapidly expanding availability of serology services for NHS patients will also help understand the long-term implications of serostatus and prior infection in different patient groups, particularly before emergence of any 'second-wave' outbreak or introduction of a vaccination programme.","Sweeney, N.; Merrick, B.; Pickering, S.; Pedro Galao, R.; Botgros, A.; Wilson, H.

At this point, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease; however, tracing back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, it may be possible to estimate the changes that may have occurred in the past, if we can suitably fit a proper model to daily event-occurrences. We have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. This method detects changes occurring in the spread of the contagion in each country. Furthermore, this method can assess the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number representing the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case.

Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.",Cindy Hoerner; Christoph Schuermann; Arne Auste; Aileen Ebenig; Samada Muraleedharan; Maike Herrmann; Barbara Schnierle; Michael D Muehlebach,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198291v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,False
178,An exploratory Integrated Moving Average Time Series Model of the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in six (6) significantly impacted Countries,"The 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a single-stranded RNA virus that has threatened the lives of humans all over the globe. Government officials, policy makers and public health officials have been scrambling and struggling to flatten the curve to decelerate the prevalence and spread of COVID-19 given the significant economic destruction of the spread of the virus. Most flatten the curve models are based on Compartmental Models. This preliminary research is based on six (6) selected countries significantly impacted by COVID-19 and endeavors to build a new model based on moving averages lagged at different time periods to better hone in on the time the COVID-19 begins to decelerate using the date of first reported case and date of first reported death. This new model, the Consistent Deceleration Model (CDM) is based on each individual countrys date of Peak Increase in Mortality Rate (PINC MR) and the Moving Average since the peak increase in mortality rate (MA POSTINC). The CDM can be utilized of one of many quantitative tools to determine the strength of the deceleration of an infectious outbreak.","Pascarella, J.; Pascarella, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150136v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
179,ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in aging mouse brain,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Through a systematic analysis of publicly available mouse brain sc/snRNA-seq data, we found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in small sub-populations of endothelial cells and mural cells, namely pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, functional changes in viral mRNA transcription and replication, and impaired blood-brain barrier regulation were most prominently implicated in the aged, ACE2-expressing endothelial cells, when compared to the young adult mouse brains. Concordant EC transcriptomic changes were further found in normal aged human brains. Overall, this work reveals an outline of ACE2 distribution in the mouse brain and identify putative brain host cells that may underlie the selective susceptibility of the aging brain to viral infection.",SU Bin Lim; Valina L.

180,A simple protein-based SARS-CoV-2 surrogate neutralization assay,"With the COVID-19 pandemic surpassing 12M confirmed cases and 550K deaths worldwide, defining the key components of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical. Of particular importance is the identification of immune correlates of infection that would support public health decision-making on treatment approaches, vaccination strategies, and convalescent plasma therapy. While ELISA-based assays to detect and quantitate antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples have been developed, the detection of neutralizing antibodies typically requires more demanding cell-based viral assays. Here, we present and validate a safe and efficient protein-based assay for the detection of serum and plasma antibodies that block the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with its receptor, angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2). This test is performed on the same platform and in parallel with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against the RBD and serves as a surrogate neutralization assay.",Kento T Abe; Zhijie Li; Reuben Samson; Payman Samavarchi-Tehrani; Emelissa J Valcourt; Heidi Wood; Patrick Budylowski; Alan Dupuis; Roxie C Girardin; Bhavisha Rathod; Karen Colwill; Allison McGeer; Samira Mubareka; Jennifer L.

Here inhibitors of two coronavirus spike proteins (S) were identified by screening a library of approved drugs with SARS-S and MERS-S pseudotyped particle entry assays. Using high-throughput screening technology, we discovered three compounds (cepharanthine, abemaciclib and trimipramine) to be broad spectrum inhibitors for spike-mediated entry.

182,Transmission dynamics and control measures of COVID-19 outbreak in China: a modelling study,"COVID-19 is reported to have been effectively brought under control in China at its initial start place. To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we combine a mathematical modelling with multiple datasets to estimate its transmissibility and severity and how it was affected by the unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 29th January 2020, the ascertainment rate is 6.9%(95%CI: 3.5 - 14.6%); then it increased to 41.5%(95%CI: 30.6 - 65.1%). The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.23(95%CI: 1.86 - 3.22) before 8th February 2020; then it dropped to 0.04(95%CI: 0.01 - 0.10). This estimation also indicates that the effect on transmissibility of control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 emerged about two weeks late. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 4.41%(95%CI: 3.65 - 5.30%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from the undetected infected people. This implies that the successful control in China was achieved through decreasing the contact rates among people in general populations and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infected cases.","Zhang, X.; Vynnycky, E.; Charlett, A.; de Angelis, D.; Chen, Z.; Liu, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150086v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150086v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
183,Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Indian state of Karnataka,"Karnataka, a state in south India, reported its first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on March 8, 2020, more than a month after the first case was reported in India. We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 47 full genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into six lineages (Pangolin lineages-A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 12 contact clusters and 11 cases with no known contacts. We found nine of the 12 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (8/12) were contained within a single district, consistent with local spread. In most of the twelve clusters, the index case (9/12) and spreaders (8/12) were symptomatic. Of the 47 sequences, 31 belonged to the B/B.6 lineage, including seven of eleven cases with no known contact, this is consistent with the ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka is consistent with multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution. This is the first study from India combining genomic data with epidemiological information emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to outbreak response.","Pattabiraman, C.; Habib, F.; PK, H.; Rasheed, R.; Reddy, V.; Dinesh, P.; Damodar, T.; Kiran Reddy, N.

184,The diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid point-of-care tests for human coronavirus: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Many recent studies reported coronavirus point of care tests (POCTs) based on isothermal amplification. However, the performances of these tests have not been systematically evaluated. We searched databases for studies that provide data to calculate sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). We included 43 studies on 5204 specimens. Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Most studies (n = 21) used reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Summary estimated ln(DOR) for RT-LAMP of RNA purified COVID-19 samples is 6.50 (95%CI 5.25-7.76), similar to the previously reported value for RT-LAMP of other RNA virus. RT-LAMP from crude samples has significantly lower ln(DOR) at 4.46 (95%CI 3.53-5.38). SAMBA-II has the highest ln(DOR) at 8.00 (95%CI 6.14-9.87). Abbott ID Now performance is similar to RT-LAMP of crude sample. The performances of CRISPR diagnosis and RT-LAMP are not significantly different. Types of coronaviruses and publication status have no significant effect on diagnosis performance. Existing nucleic acid POCTs, particularly RT-LAMP, CRISPR diagnosis and SAMBA-II, have good diagnostic performance. Future work should focus on improving a study design to minimize the risk of biases.","Subsoontorn, P.; Lohitnavy, M.; Kongkaew, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150235v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20150235v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
185,Addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care reduces mortality in severe COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 antibody that has been used for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing the mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of Tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care alone. Methods: The literature search for studies that compared Tocilizumab and Standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14th, 2020. Search words Tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 antibody, and COVID-19 or coronavirus 2019 in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data was gathered on an excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Five studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were thirteen retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the standard of care group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the Tocilizumab group. The death rate in the tocilizumab group, 22.4% (258/1153), was lower than the standard of care group, 26.21% (652/2,488) (Pooled odds ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.36-0.92] p=0.02). There was a significant heterogeneity (Inconsistency index= 80%) among the included studies. Conclusion: The addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care might reduce the mortality in severe COVID-19. Larger randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.","Boregowda, U.; Perisetti, A.; Nanjappa, A.; Gajendran, M.; Goyal, H.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150680v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150680v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True

All patients, including asymptomatic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition to a qualitative answer, providing viral load values to the RT-PCR results not only helped the clinician to evaluate the stage of the infection but addressed patient contagiousness and guided infection control decisions.

187,The emergence of COVID-19 in Indonesia: analysis of predictors of infection and mortality using independent and clustered data approaches,"Background: Analyses of correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality have usually assessed individual predictors. This study aimed to determine if patterns of combined predictors may better identify risk of infection and mortality. Methods: For the period of March 2nd to 10th 2020, the first 9 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, we selected all 18 confirmed cases, of which 6 died, and all 60 suspected cases, of which 1 died; and 28 putatively negative patients with pneumonia and no travel history. We recorded data for travel, contact history, symptoms, haematology, comorbidities, and chest x-ray. Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors. Comorbidities may warrant careful attention as would COVID-19 exposure levels.","Burhan, E.; Syam, A. F.; Rahyussalim, A. J.; Prasenohadi, P.; Wulung, N. G. L.; Susanto, A. D.; Sajinadiyasa, I. G.

189,The Age Pattern of the Male- to- Female Ratio in Mortality from COVID-19 Mirrors that of Cardiovascular Disease but not Cancer in the General Population,"Background: Males are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex) ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in the general population. Methods: We obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in middle-to-high income countries. Findings: In both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19 exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European countries. Interpretation: The sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.","Nimgaonkar, I.; Valeri, L.; Susser, E.

191,Diagnostic value of skin manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease. The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","Bataille, V.; Visconti, A.; Rossi, N.; Murray, B.; Bournot, A.; Wolf, J.; Ourselin, S.; Steves, C.; Spector, T.; Falchi, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150656v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150656v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
192,Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration and Loading Variability from Grab and 24-Hour Composite Samples,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires a significant, coordinated public health response. Assessing case density and spread of infection is critical and relies largely on clinical testing data. However, clinical testing suffers from known limitations, including test availability and a bias towards enumerating only symptomatic individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has gained widespread support as a potential complement to clinical testing for assessing COVID-19 infections at the community scale. The efficacy of WBE hinges on the ability to accurately characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater. To date, a variety of sampling schemes have been used without consensus around the appropriateness of grab or composite sampling. Here we address a key WBE knowledge gap by examining the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater grab samples collected every 2 hours for 72 hours compared with corresponding 24-hour flow-weighted composite samples. Results show relatively low variability (mean for all assays = 741 copies 100 mL-1, standard deviation = 508 copies 100 mL-1) for grab sample concentrations, and good agreement between most grab samples and their respective composite (mean deviation from composite = 159 copies 100 mL-1). When SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are used to calculate viral load, the discrepancy between grabs (log10 difference = 12.0) or a grab and its associated composite (log10 difference = 11.8) are amplified. A similar effect is seen when estimating carrier prevalence in a catchment population with median estimates based on grabs ranging 62-1853 carriers. Findings suggest that grab samples may be sufficient to characterize SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, but additional calculations using these data may be sensitive to grab sample variability and warrant the use of flow-weighted composite sampling. These data inform future WBE work by helping determine the most appropriate sampling scheme and facilitate sharing of datasets between studies via consistent methodology.","Curtis, K.; Keeling, D.; Yetka, K.; Larson, A.; Gonzalez, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150607v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150607v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True

COVID-19 infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery. Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia. Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7.

194,Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: case series in Sinaloa,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect both adults and children. Although the disease, named COVID-19, has a lower prevalence in infancy and has been described as mild, the clinical characteristics may vary and there is a possibility of complications. Objectives: To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric cases confirmed in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, during the first three months of the pandemic, and of children admitted with COVID-19 to a secondary hospital. Methods: This case series includes all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR testing, identified in the state epidemiological surveillance system between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Confirmed patients admitted to the Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital (HPS) during the same dates are also described. Results: Fifty one children with SARS-CoV-2 were included, 10 of the admitted to HPS. The median age was 10 years. The more frequent symptoms were fever (78%), cough (67%) and headache (57%). Most cases were mild or asymptomatic. Three patients with comorbidities died. Only 4 of 10 patients identified in HPS had been admitted with the diagnosis of possible COVID-19. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children was mostly mild or asymptomatic, but with a wide range of clinical presentations.","Perez Gaxiola, G.; Flores Rocha, R.; Valadez Vidarte, J.

195,In-house modification and improvement of the CDC real-time PCR diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.,"The world is currently facing an unprecedented pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which was first reported in late 2019 by China to the World Health Organization (WHO). The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature by 7{degrees}C to 62{degrees}C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies/l for both nCoV 2019_N1/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies/l for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.","Das, S.; Dowell-Martino, C.; Arrigo, L.; Fiedler, P.

196,COVID-19 severity is predicted by earlier evidence of accelerated aging,"With no known treatments or vaccine, COVID-19 presents a major threat, particularly to older adults, who account for the majority of severe illness and deaths. The age-related susceptibility is partly explained by increased comorbidities including dementia and type II diabetes. While it is unclear why these diseases predispose risk, we hypothesize that increased biological age, rather than chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity with age. To test this hypothesis, we applied our previously validated biological age measure (PhenoAge) composed of chronological age and nine clinical chemistry biomarkers to data of 347,751 participants from a large community cohort in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank), recruited between 2006 and 2010. Other data included disease diagnoses (to 2017), mortality data (to 2020), and the UK national COVID-19 test results (to May 31, 2020). Accelerated aging 10-14 years prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with test positivity (OR=1.15 per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.21, p=3.2x10-6) and all-cause mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR=1.25, per 5-year acceleration, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.44, p=0.002) after adjustment for demographics including current chronological age and pre-existing diseases or conditions. The corresponding areas under the curves were 0.669 and 0.803, respectively. Biological aging, as captured by PhenoAge, is a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than chronological age, and may inform risk stratification initiatives, while also elucidating possible underlying mechanisms, particularly those related to inflammaging.","Kuo, C.-L.; Pilling, L.

197,A comprehensive analysis of R0 with different lockdown phase during covid-19 in India,"Background: World Health organization declared Covid-19 as an outbreak, hence preventive measure like lockdown should be taken to control the spread of infection. This study offers an exhaustive analysis of the reproductive number (R0) in India with major intervention for COVID-19 outbreaks and analysed the lockdown effects on the Covid-19. Methodology: Covid-19 data extracted from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Then, a novel method implemented in the incidence and Optimum function in desolve package to the data of cumulative daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the reproduction number in the R software. Result: Analysis has been seen that the lockdown was really quite as effective, India has already shown a major steady decline. The growth rate has fluctuated about 20 percent with trend line projections in various lockdown. A comparative analysis gives an idea of decline in value of R0 from 1.73 to 1.08. Annotation plot showing the predicted R0 values based on previous lockdown in month of June and July. Conclusion: Without lockdown, the growth might not have been contained in India and may have gone into the exponential zone. We show that, the lockdown in India was fairly successful. The effect partial lifting of the lockdown (unlock) is also seen in the results, in terms of increment in R0 values. Hence this study provides a platform for policy makers and government authorities for implementing the strategies to prevent the spread of infection.","Chhabra, M.; Agrawal, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150631v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150631v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
198,In vivo demonstration of microvascular thrombosis in severe Covid-19,Several autopsies studies showed the presence of microthrombi in the pulmonary circulation of the severe COVID-19. The major limitation of these investigations is that the autopsy provided static information. Some of these alterations could be secondary to the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) observed as the final common pathway of the multisystem organ failure exhibited in the critical patient. We report the preliminary results of an in vivo evaluation of the sublingual microcirculation in thirteen patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at the beginning of the hospitalization. They did not have any laboratorial DIC evidence. We observed multiple filling defects moving within the sublingual microvessels indicative of microthrombi in 11 (85%) patients. This is the first imaging documentation of microvascular thrombosis in living patients with severe COVID-19.

199,What can the ideal gas say about global pandemics? Reinterpreting the basic reproduction number,"Through analysis of the ideal gas, we construct a random walk that on average matches the standard susceptible-infective-removed (SIR) model. We show that the most widely referenced parameter, the 'basic reproduction number' (R0), is fundamentally connected to the relative odds of increasing or decreasing the infectives population. As a consequence, for R0 > 1 the probability that no outbreak occurs is 1/R0. In stark contrast to a deterministic SIR, when R0 = 1.5 the random walk has a 67% chance of avoiding outbreak. Thus, an alternative, probabilistic, interpretation of R0 arises, which provides a novel estimate of the critical population density {gamma}/r without fitting SIR models. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 in the United States is consistent with our model and attempt an estimate of {gamma}/r. In doing so, we uncover a significant source of bias in public data reporting. Data are aggregated on political boundaries, which bear no concern for dispersion of population density. We show that this introduces bias in fits and parameter estimates, a concern for understanding fundamental virus parameters and for policy making. Anonymized data at the resolution required for contact tracing would afford access to {gamma}/r without fitting. The random walk SIR developed here highlights the intuition that any epidemic is stochastic and recovers all the key parameter values noted by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.","Dickson, B.

200,Lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa: A rapid study of nine countries,"Lockdown measures have been introduced worldwide to contain the transmission of COVID-19. This paper defines the term lockdown and describes the design, timing and implementation of lockdown in nine countries in Sub Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It also discusses the manner in which lockdown is enforced, the need to mitigate the harms of lockdown, and the association between lockdown and the reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. While there are some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown, a more notable finding is the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures across the nine countries. We found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests done, and that testing rates ranged from 9 to 21,261 per million population. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies, but is generally low when compared to countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit some community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. Of concern are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic harms. This paper highlights the need for inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary research capable of providing a rigorous and holistic assessment of the harms and benefits of lockdown.","Haider, N.; Osman, A.

201,Characteristics and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in healthcare workers at a London teaching hospital,"Background Healthcare worker (HCW) associated COVID-19 is of global concern due to the potential for nosocomial spread and depletion of staff numbers. However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. Aim To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. Methods Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft ExcelTM. Findings COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Conclusion These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.

Asymptomatic and mild patients were classified into at least four types based on NAT and serological tests, especially 81% and 25.4% negative NAT but positive IgM/IgG responses, respectively. Antibody dynamics were further demonstrated by IgM and IgG profile responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteome. IgM antibody responses against S1 were elicited in asymptomatic individuals as early to the seventh day after exposure and peaked on days from 17d to 25d, which might be used as early diagnostic biomarkers. Moreover, asymptomatic individuals evoked weaker S1 specific IgM and neutralizing antibody responses than mild patients. Most importantly, S1 specific IgM/IgG responses and the titers of neutralizing antibody in asymptomatic individuals gradually vanished in two months. Our findings might have important implications for serological survey, public health and immunization strategy.","Lei, Q.; Li, Y.; Hou, H.; Wang, F.; Zhang, Y.; Lai, D.; Jo-Lewis, B.

203,What cost decisiveness? A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 in India,"On 24th March, 2020 the Government of India announced a national level lockdown to contain the spread of COVID. The lockdown policy has generated considerable controversy, with critics arguing that it was done without adequate notice or planning, exposed vulnerable section of the population to a humanitarian crisis, and failed to contain the spread of COVID. In response, the Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken the first cost-benefit analysis of the worlds biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios.

204,ReCoNet: Multi-level Preprocessing of Chest X-rays for COVID-19 Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Life-threatening COVID-19 detection from radiomic features has become a dire need of the present time for infection control and socio-economic crisis management around the world. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively. The immense potential of ReCoNet may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle income countries where RT-PCR labs and/or kits are in a serious crisis.","Ahmed, S.; Yap, M.

However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality.

206,Undocumented infectives in the Covid-19 pandemic,"Background. A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. Its mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.","Melis, M.; Littera, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149682v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149682v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
207,"Negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quantitative parameters, quality, and circadian alignment: Implications for psychological well-being and emotional regulation","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, affecting millions of people and exposing them to home quarantine, isolation, and social distancing. While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality. Online interventions including self-help sleep programs, stress management, relaxation practices, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training are available interventions in the current situation.","Salehinejad, M.

208,Bibliometric Analysis of COVID-19 in the Context of Migration Health: A Study Protocol,"Introduction: Human mobility has been pivotal to the spread of COVID-19 through travel and migration.To mitigate the spread, most countries have imposed strict travel restrictions that have severely affected both the wellbeing and livelihoods of many migrant and mobile populations (both internally and internationally), particularly those from impoverished communities, those affected by humanitarian crises, including populations displaced and/or living in camps and camp-like settings. The need to include migrants (both regular and irregular or undocumented) in national strategic response plans for disease prevention and control has been increasingly recognized. Better understanding of the existing scientific evidence in migration health is crucial in designing effective response measures. In this paper, we present a protocol for a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. Expected study findings aim to provide valuable information to support evidence mapping on COVID-19 and migration health, particularly the identification of important research gaps. Methods and analysis: Using Elseviers Scopus abstract and citation database, a comprehensive search strategy will be applied to map scientific publications on COVID-19 and migration health. The current analysis will focus on research published from 1 January 2020 to 4 May 2020. The search query on migration health will largely focus on migration, migrant and human mobility-related terms. Three reviewers will screen publications for eligibility. The extracted bibliographic information will be analysed to determine the dominant research themes, country coverage and migrant groups. Collaboration networks will be analysed using VosViewer, a network analysis software. A deep dive on dominant research themes or migrant health-related topics will be done by creating visualization network maps of keywords from the retrieved publications.","Pernitez-Agan, S.; Bautista, M.

209,SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction using magnetic beads for rapid large-scale testing by RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP,"Rapid large-scale testing is essential for controlling the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and alternative, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform.

210,"Using simulation to assess the potential effectiveness of implementing screening at national borders during international outbreaks of influenza, SARS, Ebola virus disease and COVID-19","The effectiveness of screening travellers for signs of infection during times of international disease outbreak is contentious, especially as the reduction of the risk of disease importation can be very small. Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers. We compare our results to those already in the published literature.","Bays, D.; Bennett, E.; Finnie, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150664v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150664v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
211,Association of Cancer with Risk and Mortality of COVID-19: Results from the UK Biobank,"Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.","Shi, Z.; Resurreccion, W.

212,Perceived preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic: A study with healthcare workers in Ghana,"Introduction: Healthcare workers' (HCWs) preparedness to respond to pandemics is critical to containing disease spread. Low-resource countries, however, experience barriers to preparedness due to limited resources. In Ghana, a country with a constrained healthcare system and high COVID-19 cases, we examined HCWs' perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 and associated factors. Methods: 472 HCWs completed questions in a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. Perceived preparedness was assessed using a 15-question scale (Cronbach alpha=0.91) and summative scores were created (range=0-45). Higher scores meant greater perceived preparedness. We used linear regression with robust standard errors to examine associations between perceived preparedness and potential predictors. Results: The average preparedness score was 24 (SD=8.9); 27.8% of HCWs felt prepared. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher perceived preparedness were: training ({beta}=3.35, 95%CI: 2.01 to 4.69); having adequate PPE ({beta}=2.27, 95%CI: 0.26 to 4.29), an isolation ward ({beta}=2.74, 95%CI: 1.15 to 4.33), and protocols for screening ({beta}=2.76, 95%CI: 0.95 to 4.58); and good perceived communication from management ({beta}=5.37, 95%CI: 4.03 to 7.90). When added to the model, perceived knowledge decreased the effect of training by 28.0%, although training remained significant, suggesting a partial mediating role. Perceived knowledge was associated with a 6-point increase in perceived preparedness score ({beta}=6.04, 95%CI: 4.19 to 7.90). Conclusion: HCWs reported low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19. Training, clear protocols, PPE availability, isolation wards, and communication play an important role in increasing preparedness. Government stakeholders must institute necessary interventions to increase HCWs' preparedness to respond to the ongoing pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.","Afulani, P. A.; Gyamerah, A.

214,Serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 after mild and severe COVID-19 infection and analysis of IgG non-responders,"Background: To accurately interpret COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys, knowledge of serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 with a better understanding of patients who do not seroconvert, is imperative. This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","Marklund, E.; Leach, S.; Axelsson, H.; Nordström, K.; Norder, H.; Bemark, M.; Angeletti, D.; Lundgren, A.; Nilsson, S.; Andersson, L.-M.; Yilmaz, A.; Lindh, M.; Liljeqvist, J.-A.; Gisslen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151324v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
215,Decreased serum levels of inflammaging marker miR-146a are associated with clinical response to tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients,"Background. Current COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global health and healthcare systems. At least in western countries, the most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases. In this regard, we proposed that COVID-19 severity may be tightly related to inflammaging, i.e. the age-related onset of inflammation, which is responsible for age-related diseases. It has been reported that systemic hyper-inflammation may turn to be detrimental in COVID-19 patients. Objective. Here, we exploited a recently closed clinical trial (NCT04315480) on the anti-IL-6 drug tocilizumab to assess whether microRNAs regulating inflammaging can be assessed as biomarkers of drug response and outcome. Methods. Serum levels of miR-146a-5p, -21-5p, and -126-3p were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR by two independent laboratories on 30 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19, characterized by multifocal interstitial pneumonia confirmed by CT-scan and requiring oxygen therapy, and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. COVID-19 patients were treated with a single-dose intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab and categorized into responders and non-responders. Results. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to tocilizumab have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p=0.007). Moreover, among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p=0.008). Conclusion. Our data show that blood-based biomarkers, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide a molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to enlarge the drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","Sabbatinelli, J.; Giuliani, A.; Matacchione, G.; Latini, S.; Laprovitera, N.; Pomponio, G.; Ferrarini, A.; Svegliati Baroni, S.; Pavani, M.; Moretti, M.; Gabrielli, A.; Procopio, A.

216,Psychological state and family functioning of University of Ibadan students during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background: The curtailment of social gatherings as well as lack of online academic engagement, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, could have potentially damaging effects on the psychological state of university students in Nigeria. This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at  0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

217,Modeling and Preparedness: The Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 Outbreak in Provinces of Ecuador,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan of China, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease has become a pandemic in just a few months and spread globally with more than 2.89 million cases and 203,000 deaths across 185 countries, as of April 26th, 2020. Ecuador has reported one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, with more than 10K cases and 500 deaths in a country of approximately 17 million people. The dynamics of the outbreak is being observed quite different in different provinces of Ecuador with high reported prevalence in some low population density provinces. In this study, we aim to understand variations in outbreaks between provinces and provide assistance in essential preparedness planning in order to respond effectively to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The study estimated the critical level of quarantine rate along with corresponding leakage in order to avoid overwhelming the local health care system. The results suggest that provinces with high population density can avoid a large disease burden provided they initiate early and stricter quarantine measures even under low isolation rate. To best of our knowledge, this study is first from the region to determine which provinces will need much preparation for current outbreak in fall and which might need more help.","Bustamante Orellana, C.

The study objective was to develop a wastewater testing method to analyze SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of community infection rate resurgence of COVID-19 or in well-defined sites such as production facilities or nursing homes. Eurofins performed >700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution & linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02%-0,1% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000). The wastewater testing method was used to monitor a Danish Community after a COVID-19 outbreak and it was shown that the method can be used as a semi-quantitative method to monitor the development of an outbreak.","Jorgensen, A.

221,"Obesity, walking pace and risk of severe COVID-19: Analysis of UK Biobank","Obesity is an emerging risk factor for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Simple measures of physical fitness, such as self-reported walking pace, could also be important risk factors, but have not been well documented. This analysis includes 414,201 UK Biobank participants with complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data. We analysed the risk of severe (in-hospital) COVID-19 across categories of obesity status and walking pace. As of June 20th 2020 there were 972 cases of severe COVID-19 that had occurred within the cohort. Compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-9 in those with obesity was 1.49 (1.24, 1.78). Compared to those with a brisk walking pace, the OR in slow walkers was 1.84 (1.49, 2.27). Slow walkers had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 regardless of obesity status. For example, compared to normal weight brisk walkers, the odds of severe COVID-19 in obese brisk walkers was 1.39 (0.99, 1.98), whereas the odds in normal weight slow walkers was 2.48 (1.56, 3.93). Self-reported walking pace, a simple measure of functional fitness, appears to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that is independent of obesity.

222,Commercial Serology Assays Predict Neutralization Activity Against SARS-CoV-2,"Background. Currently it is unknown whether a positive serology results correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. Methods. A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N=164) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and the levels of neutralizing antibodies detected was correlated. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. Results. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a PPA of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a NPA of 98.0% across 100 negative controls. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrates they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. Conclusions. For the first time, we demonstrate that three widely available clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. When a two-platform screen and confirm approach was used for SARS-CoV-2 serology, nearly 80% of two-platform positive specimens had neutralization titers (ID50 >50).","Suhandynata, R. T.; Hoffman, M.

We performed genome-wide association scans of two age-adjusted biological age measures (PhenoAgeAcceleration and BioAgeAcceleration), estimated from clinical biochemistry markers1,2 in European-descent participants from UK Biobank. The strongest signals were found in the APOE gene, tagged by the two major protein-coding SNPs, PhenoAgeAccel-rs429358 (APOE e4 determinant) (p=1.50 x 10-72); BioAgeAccel-rs7412 (APOE e2 determinant) (p=3.16 x 10-60). Interestingly, we observed inverse APOE e2 and e4 associations and unique pathway enrichments when comparing the two biological age measures. Genes associated with BioAgeAccel were enriched in lipid related pathways, while genes associated with PhenoAgeAccel showed enrichment for immune system, cell function, and carbohydrate homeostasis pathways, suggesting the two measures capture different aging domains. Our study reaffirms that aging patterns are heterogenous across individuals, and the manner in which a person ages may be partly attributed to genetic predisposition.","Kuo, C.-L.; Pilling, L.

224,Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.","Seow, J.; Graham, C.; Merrick, B.; Acors, S.; Steel, K.

225,Societal heterogeneity contributes to complex dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 pandemics: insights from a novel Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM),"After months of COVID-19 quarantine, businesses are reopening their doors and people are reentering society. Within the current COVID-19 data, after a slow-down of infection, a new peak in active cases is already forming. Here we developed a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM) to investigate genesis of complex pandemic patterns with the focus on the role of heterogenous societal structure. Using this model with R0 of COVID-19, we simulated viral infection in different scenarios where isolated, communities surround the main cluster of the population. Depending on the parameters of heterogeneity and isolation period, our simulations generated a multimodal growth periods with multiple peaks, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second wave of infection. We show that timing and magnitude of infection for previously unaffected isolated clusters of people, such as suburban neighborhoods, are critical aspects of these patterns. Our model can be applied to communities at any given scale of population described as a fractal-like structure, i.e. from the entire human population, to a country, down to a province or city levels with relevant societal heterogeneity structure. The current COVID-19 pandemic development worldwide and in the US follows a bimodal rise pattern, qualitatively similar to that in our simulations. We interpret our data to indicate that the secondary peak in the pattern is contributed by the states and counties in the US with late infection surges that are analogous to isolated suburbs in our model. Furthermore, the on-going early reopening, i.e. premature partial reopening in our model, is further accelerating the peak rise. This peak now reaches new heights, forcing many states in the US to reverse their policies and reestablish their quarantine measures. Our results support these timely and effective measures: we show that longer quarantine periods can reduce the number of deaths and transform the current trend into a substantially delayed (>1 year) second wave. If this scenario becomes a reality, it is important (i) to develop the vaccine and/or effective treatment before the second wave; (ii) to warn people living in suburbs that it is these isolated areas that may hold a false sense of security, but they should continue to take extra care for their public health.","Maltsev, A.

226,"No Excess Mortality of COVID-19 in Japan until April, 2020","Background: As of the end of June, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited its highest peak on April 3. Nevertheless, no remarkable excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has been observed. Object: We sought to quantify excess mortality in April using the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) model. Method: We applied the NIID model to deaths of all causes from 1987 up through April, 2020. Results: Results show no significant excess mortality in March or April, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak affected Japan most. Discussion and Conclusion: Because changes in application rule of the International Classification of Diseases in 2017 affected the number of pneumonia deaths drastically, we were unable to use pneumonia deaths to estimate excess mortality. it might be important to continue to monitor excess mortality of COVID-19 carefully after May 2020.","Kurita, J.; Sugawara, T.; Sugishita, Y.; Ohkusa, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20143164v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20143164v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
227,"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia","Introduction. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indonesia announced the first COVID-19 case on 2 March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Samarinda as the capital of East Kalimantan has been focused for its capability of handling COVID-19 patients. We report the epidemiological characteristics and immunofluorescence assay results of these patients. Methods. All patients with positive confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to hospitals and quarantine center in Samarinda. We retrospectively analyzed data from the daily report of the Samarinda City and East Kalimantan Health Office information system. Results. By June 25, 2020, 64 patients had been identified as having positive confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 {+/-} 13.8 years. Most of the patients were men (57 [90.6%] patients). Thirty-nine COVID-19 patients were imported cases with a history of traveling from South Sulawesi. Most of the patients were admitted to the Quarantine Center of Samarinda City. The mean duration from the first hospital admission for isolation to discharge was 25.6 {+/-} 13.1 days. There was only one death case of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda. There were the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Samarinda in early June 2020. There was a declining trend in the age of COVID-19 patients and the duration of isolation time in the hospital. Discussion. Imported cases still contributed to the increase of COVID-19 cases in Samarinda. Younger age of COVID-19 patients was more involved in frequent mobility which makes them cause the spread of the disease. Activation of the national reference laboratory for the COVID-19 examination in Samarinda has reduced the length of time patients treated in hospitals. Conclusion. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients show the ability of local governments to deal with this pandemic. This can be seen from the low case fatality rate in Samarinda.","Paramita, S.; Isnuwardana, R.; Rahmadi, A.; Rafshodia, O.; Kusasih, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151175v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.20151175v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
228,Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States,"Since its global emergence in 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple epidemics in the United States. Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","Olney, A.

229,Diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT scan images and deep learning techniques,"Early diagnosis of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for controlling this pandemic. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly all over the world. There is no vaccine available for this virus yet. Fast and accurate COVID-19 screening is possible using computed tomography (CT) scan images. The deep learning techniques used in the proposed method was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our manuscript focuses on differentiating the CT scan images of COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 CT using different deep learning techniques. A self developed model named CTnet-10 was designed for the COVID-19 diagnosis, having an accuracy of 82.1 %. Also, other models that we tested are DenseNet-169, VGG-16, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG-19. The VGG-19 proved to be superior with an accuracy of 94.52 % as compared to all other deep learning models. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 from the CT scan pictures can be used by the doctors as a quick and efficient method for COVID-19 screening.","Shah, V.; Keniya, R.; Shridharani, A.; Punjabi, M.; Shah, J.; Mehendale, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151332v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151332v1?rss=1,2020-07-11,2020-07-11,,True
230,Serology in Children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19,"Objectives: We aimed to measure SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses in children hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) compared to COVID-19, Kawasaki Disease (KD) and other hospitalized pediatric controls. Methods: From March 17, 2020 - May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with MIS-C (n=10), symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n=10), KD (n=5), and hospitalized controls (n=4). With IRB approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG binding antibodies by quantitative ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed correlation analyses using linear regression. Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (R2=0.512, P<0.046) and with hospital and ICU lengths of stay (R2=0.590, P=0.010). Conclusion: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titers may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from other similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","Rostad, C.

231,The 4C Initiative (Clinical Care for Cardiovascular disease in the COVID-19 pandemic): monitoring the indirect impact of the coronavirus pandemic on services for cardiovascular diseases in the UK,"Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affects cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) directly through infection and indirectly through health service reorganisation and public health policy. Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.","CVD-COVID-UK Consortium,; Ball, S.; Banerjee, A.; Berry, C.; Boyle, J.; Bray, B.; Bradlow, W.; Chaudhry, A.; Crawley, R.; Danesh, J.; Denniston, A.; Falter, F.; Figueroa, J.; Hall, C.; Hemingway, H.; Jefferson, E.; Johnson, T.; King, G.; Lee, K.; McKean, P.; Mason, S.; Mills, N.; Pearson, E.; Pirmohamed, M.; Poon, M.

232,Genomic Mutations and Changes in Protein Secondary Structure and Solvent Accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Virus),"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.",Thanh Thi Nguyen; Pubudu N.

233,Comprehensive in-vivo secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals novel regulatory motifs and mechanisms,"SARS-CoV-2 is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes COVID-19, a disease that has triggered a major human health and economic crisis. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form stable RNA structures and yet, as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored in the context of a viral infection. Our limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 genomic architecture is a fundamental limitation to both our mechanistic understanding of coronavirus life cycle and the development of COVID-19 RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine for the first time the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome probed in infected cells. In addition to the conserved structural motifs at the viral termini, we report new structural features like a conformationally flexible programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot, and a host of novel RNA structures, each of which highlights the importance of studying viral structures in their native genomic context. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals extensive networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis of RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 shows that several features of its genomic structure are conserved across beta coronaviruses and we pinpoint individual regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis.

To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the proteins stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation.

COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was  exhausted or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the non-exhausted subsets from patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF-{kappa}B signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8+ T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness.

Predicting species susceptibility to Covid-19,"In only a few months, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leaving physicians, scientists, and public health officials racing to understand, treat, and contain this zoonotic disease. SARS-CoV-2 has made the leap from animals to humans, but little is known about variations in species susceptibility that could identify potential reservoir species, animal models, and the risk to pets, wildlife, and livestock. While there is evidence that certain species, such as cats, are susceptible, the vast majority of animal species, including those in close contact with humans, have unknown susceptibility. Hence, methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for viral cell entry and infection. Here we identified key ACE2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ACE2 and its binding to SARS-CoV-2.

239,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of human ACE2 transgenic mice causes severe inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and compromised respiratory function","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and has spread worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although animal models have been evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection, none have recapitulated the severe lung disease phenotypes seen in hospitalized human cases. Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways. Thus, the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates many features of severe COVID-19 infection in humans and can be used to define the mechanistic basis of lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based countermeasures.",Emma S Winkler; Adam L Bailey; Natasha M Kafai; Sharmila Nair; Broc T McCune; Jinsheng Yu; Julie M Fox; Rita E Chen; James T Earnest; Shamus P Keeler; Jon H Ritter; Liang-I Kang; Sarah Dort; Annette Robichaud; Richard Head; Michael J Holtzman; Michael S Diamond,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196188v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
240,Molecular analysis of binding region of an ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 between humans and mammals,"In June 2020, a second wave of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infections raised concern in Beijing, where salmon sold a fresh fish wholesale market was suspected of being the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. It has raised questions in the press and elsewhere about the scientific basis of salmon as a source of infection. With the number of cases growing, the surface of a salmon chopping board in the market was examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and a positive reaction was observed. Following these test results, there has been debate over whether salmon can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. To find assess this, we investigated the structural homology of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host-side receptor for SARS-CoV-2, between humans and other species including salmon and mink. As a result, a high structural homology between ACE2 and mink, which has reportedly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans, was confirmed. However, a non-high structural homology of ACE2 between salmon and humans was observed. Further experiments are needed to find the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the salmon.",Takuma Hayashi; Kaoru Abiko; Masaki Mandai; Ikuo Konishi; Nobuo Yaegashi,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196378v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.196378v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
241,Discovery of clinically approved drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection using a phenotypic screening strategy and network-analysis to predict their potential to treat covid-19,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate, neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract, respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19, chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drug-host molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication, inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

242,A drug repurposing screen identifies hepatitis C antivirals as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be [~]2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of [~]6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found [~]50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 [&le;] 50 M. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 M), Ciluprevir (20.77M). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10M), and Telaprevir (15.25M). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.",Jeremy D Baker; Rikki L Uhrich; Gerald C Kraemer; Jason E Love; Brian C Kraemer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,False
243,A Strategy to Treat COVID-19 Disease with Targeted Delivery of Inhalable Liposomal Hydroxychloroquine: A Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic Study,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified pathogen causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 {micro}g/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 {micro}g/g (Cmax) in the lung. Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with normalized dose showed higher ([~]30-fold) lung exposure, longer ([~]2.5-fold) half-life in lung, but lower blood exposure with [~]20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC.

Characterising the pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hACs limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for human alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry.

By focusing on the stochastic nature of the process in small populations, our model provides decision making insight into mitigation strategies as an outbreak begins. Our model accommodates contact tracing and isolation, allowing for comparisons between different types of intervention. We emphasize a physical interpretation of the disease propagation throughout which affords analytical results for comparison to simulations.

246,ALeRT-COVID: Attentive Lockdown-awaRe Transfer Learning for Predicting COVID-19 Pandemics in Different Countries,"Countries across the world are in different stages of COVID-19 trajectory, among which many have implemented the lockdown measures to prevent its spread. Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.","Li, Y.; Jia, W.; Wang, J.; Guo, J.; Liu, Q.; Li, X.; Xie, G.; Wang, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149831v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149831v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True

This raises a few crucial questions related to the extent to which social distancing measures were (1) well timed, (2) necessary and (3) efficient. By investigating correlations between epidemic measures such as daily infection rate, and social mobility measures (as reported by Apple and Google), our study aims to establish whether data identifies social distancing measures as a primary player in controlling the outbreak in New York State.","Radulescu, A.; Ballard, S.; Gonzalez, K.; Linton, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148981v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148981v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
248,A Saudi G6PD Deficient Girl Died with Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome-COVID-19,"Reports on pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS) temporally related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing. African and Afro-Caribbean children constituted about 47% of the cases in these reports. Despite the fact that glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common among this population, the G6PD status of these cases has not been reported in these reports. We reported the first case of PMIS related to COVID-19 from Saudi Arabia. This case was a Saudi G6PD deficient girl who died with PMIS related to COVID-19. G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance and exaggerates the inflammatory response; thus, it might contribute to the development or the grave outcome of our case. We urgently need to assess the association between G6PD deficiency and COVID-19 in a large study as the G6PD deficiency may be a useful predictor for the progression of the COVID-19.","Al-Aamri, M.

249,Predictors of Anxiety Regarding The COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-care Workers in a Hospital Not Assigned to Manage COVID-19 Patients in Nepal.,"Introduction: We studied the levels and severity of anxiety caused by COVID-19 amongst frontline health-care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care neurological hospital in Nepal, not assigned to manage COVID-19 cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 frontline Health Care Workers (HCWs) using a 10-point subjective assessment tool, the Anxiety Level Index (ALI), and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS), to assess the level of anxiety regarding COVID-19. Results: On ALI 55% of HCWs were found to have marked severe anxiety (6-9), however, on SAS 44% of HCWs reported anxiety. The majority HCWs were female (n=78) with nurses forming 62% of the sample size. The mean age was 26.8 years (SD 8.17). Factors associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19 on ALI were age (p=0.002), sex (p=0.001), receiving regular COVID-19 updates via social media (p=0.011) and a high frequency of checking for COVID-19 information authenticity (p=0.039). Work experience (p=0.026) and frequency of checking for information authenticity (p=0.029) were factors found to increase SAS measured anxiety and were found to be associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that respondents with work experience of less than or equal to 2 years were 0.380 (95% CI 0.158 to 0.910) times less likely to have anxiety than those with work experience of more than 2 years. Similarly, the odds of having anxiety among those who checked information authenticity less frequently was 0.377 (95% CI 0.153 to 0.931) times less than those who often did. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a substantial impact on the mental health of frontline HCWs in a hospital not assigned to manage COVID-19 patients. Length of time of worked in healthcare and the frequency of checking for COVID-19-related information were significant predictors of anxiety.","Thapa, L.; Ghimire, A.; Ghimire, S.; Sharma, N.; Shrestha, S.; Devkota, M.; Bhattarai, S.; Maharjan, A.; Lohani, S.; Phuyal, S.; Maharjan, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148866v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148866v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
250,The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19,"SARS-CoV2 infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever and organ dysfunction and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, is more similar to Kawasaki disease, but also differ from this with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests endoglin, an endothelial glycoprotein as one of several candidate targets of autoantibodies in MIS-C.","Rosat Consiglio, C.; Cotugno, N.; Sardh, F.; Pou, C.; Amodio, D.; Zicari, S.; Ruggiero, A.; Rubens Pascucci, G.; Rodriguez, L.; Santilli, V.; Tan, Z.; Eriksson, D.; Wang, J.; Lakshmikanth, T.; Marchesi, A.; Lakshmikanth, T.; Campana, A.; Villani, A.; Rossi, P.; the CACTUS study team,; Landegren, N.; Palma, P.; Brodin, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148353v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148353v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
251,Disentangling Increased Testing From Covid-19 Epidemic Spread,"To design effective disease control strategies, it is critical to understand the incidence of diseases. In the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States (caused by outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus), testing capacity was initially very limited and has been increasing at the same time as the virus has been spreading. When estimating the incidence, it can be difficult to distinguish whether increased numbers of positive tests stem from increases in the spread of the virus or increases in testing. This has made it very difficult to identify locations in which the epidemic poses the largest public health risks. Here, we use a probabilistic model to quantify beliefs about testing strategies and understand implications regarding incidence. We apply this model to estimate the incidence in each state of the United States, and find that: (1) the Covid-19 epidemic is likely to be more widespread than reported by limited testing, (2) the Covid-19 epidemic growth in the summer months is likely smaller than it was during the spring months, and (3) the regions which are at highest risk of Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks are not always those with the largest number of positive test results.","Lengerich, B.

Currently there is no treatment and no vaccine. Interventions such as hand washing, masks, social distancing, and ""social bubbles"" are used to limit community transmission, but it is challenging to choose the best interventions for a given activity. Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of ""event R"", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Tupper, P.; Yerlanov, M.; Boury, H.; Colijn, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149435v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True

However, this requires a reliable and clinically validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific identification of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR.

Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors.

256,Performance characteristics of a high throughput automated transcription mediated amplification test for SARS-CoV-2 detection,"The COVID19 pandemic caused by the new SARSCoV2 coronavirus has imposed severe challenges on laboratories in their effort to achieve sufficient diagnostic testing capability for identifying infected individuals. In this study we report the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of a new, high throughput, fully automated nucleic acid amplification test system for the detection of SARSCoV2. The assay utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and acridinium ester labeled probe chemistry on the automated Panther System to directly amplify and detect two separate target sequences in the ORF1ab region of the SARSCoV2 RNA genome. The probit 95% limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 0.004 TCID50/ml using inactivated virus, and 25 c/ml using synthetic in vitro transcript RNA targets. Analytical sensitivity (100% detection) was confirmed to be 83 to 194 c/ml using three commercially available SARSCoV2 nucleic acid controls. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with testing six related human coronaviruses, as well as 24 other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, at high titer. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen testing (N=140) showed 100%, 98.7%, and 99.3% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively, with a validated reverse transcription PCR NAAT for SARSCoV2 RNA. These results provide validation evidence for a sensitive and specific method for pandemic-scale automated molecular diagnostic testing for SARSCoV2.","Pham, J.; Meyer, S.; Nguyen, C.; Williams, A.; Hunsicker, M.; McHardy, I.; Gendlina, I.; Goldstein, D.

257,Clinical characteristics and outcomes in diabetes patients admitted with COVID-19 in Dubai: a cross-sectional single centre study.,"Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia. Laboratory data Mean(SD) on admission for those who needed ward-based care versus those needing intensive care unit (ICU) care: Fibrinogen 462.75 (125.16) mg/dl vs 660 (187.58) mg/dl ; D-dimer 0.66 (0.55) mcg/ml vs 2.3 (3.48) mcg/ml; Ferritin 358.08 (442.05) mg/dl vs 1762.38 (2586.38) mg/dl; and CRP 33.9 (38.62) mg/L vs 137 (111.72) mg/L were all statistically significantly higher for the ICU cohort (p<0.05). Average length of stay in hospital was 14.55 days. 28.2% of patients needed ICU admission. 4.9% (n=5) overall died during hospitalisation (all in ICU). Conclusions: In this single-centre study in Dubai, 25% of patients admitted with COVID-19 also had diabetes/prediabetes. Most diabetes patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease were males of Asian origin. 14.6% had new diagnosis of diabetes/prediabetes on admission. The majority of patients with diabetes/prediabetes and COVID-19 infection had other important comorbidities (n=76; 73.8%). Only 4 patients had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR but had pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that are associated with poor prognosis: Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP levels were all statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) at presentation in patients who subsequently needed ICU care compared with those patients who remained ward-based. 28.2% overall needed ICU admission, out of which 5 patients died. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","Bhatti, R.; Omer, A.; Khattib, S.; Shiraz, S.; Matfin, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149096v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149096v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
258,"Sleep quality, mental health and circadian rhythms during COVID lockdown: Results from the SleepQuest Study","Behavioural responses to COVID19 lockdown will define the long-term impact of psychological stressors on sleep and brain health. Here we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","Carrigan, N.; Wearn, A.

259,IN-UTERO MOTHER-TO-CHILD SARS-CoV-2 TRANSMISSION: viral detection and fetal immune response,"Pregnancy is known to increase the risk of severe illnesses in response to viral infections. Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. This is essential for defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.","Fenizia, C.; Biasin, M.; Cetin, I.; Vergani, P.; Mileto, D.; Spinillo, A.; Gismondo, M.

260,Recurrent Neural Reinforcement Learning for Counterfactual Evaluation of Public Health Interventions on the Spread of Covid-19 in the world,"As the Covid-19 pandemic soars around the world, there is urgent need to forecast the expected number of cases worldwide and the length of the pandemic before receding and implement public health interventions for significantly stopping the spread of Covid-19. Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies. We applied the developed methods to real data collected from January 22, 2020 to June 28, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. We forecasted that the number of laboratory confirmed cumulative cases of Covid-19 will pass 26 million as of August 14, 2020.","Ge, Q.; Hu, Z.; Zhang, K.; Li, S.; Lin, W.; Jin, L.; Xiong, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149146v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20149146v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
261,Evolution and impact of COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes: population analysis in 189 care homes in one geographic region,"Background: COVID-19 has had large impact on care-home residents internationally. This study systematically examines care-home outbreaks of COVID-19 in a large Scottish health board. Methods: Analysis of testing, cases and deaths using linked care-home, testing and mortality data for 189 care-homes with 5843 beds in a large Scottish Health Board up to 15/06/20. Findings: 70 (37.0%) of care-homes experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, 66 of which were in care-homes for older people where care-home size was strongly associated with outbreaks (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94). There were 852 confirmed cases and 419 COVID-related deaths, 401 (95.7%) of which occurred in care-homes with an outbreak, 16 (3.8%) in hospital, and two in the 119 care-homes without a known outbreak. For non-COVID related deaths, there were 73 excess deaths in care-homes with an outbreak, but no excess deaths in care-homes without an outbreak, and 24 fewer deaths than expected of care-home residents in hospital. A quarter of COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred in five (2.6%) care-homes, and half in 13 (6.9%) care-homes. Interpretation: The large impact on excess deaths appears to be primarily a direct effect of COVID-19, with cases and deaths are concentrated in a minority of care homes. A key implication is that there is a large pool of susceptible residents if community COVID-19 incidence increases again. Shielding residents from potential sources of infection and rapid action into minimise outbreak size where infection is introduced will be critical in any wave 2.

262,Disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in African Americans correlates with dynamic segregation,"Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","Bassolas, A.; Sousa, S.; Nicosia, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148742v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148742v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True
263,A case-control and cohort study to determine the relationship between ethnic background and severe COVID-19,"Background. People of minority ethnic background may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19 for reasons that are unclear. We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.","Zakeri, R.; Bendayan, R.; Ashworth, M.; Bean, D.

However, the initial steps of antiviral immunity are not known. Here, we have studied the interaction of isolated primary SARS-CoV-2 viral strains with human plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pDC), a key player in antiviral immunity. We show that pDC are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed checkpoint molecules at levels similar to influenza virus-induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-, interferon-{lambda}1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. Importantly, all major aspects of SARS-CoV-2-induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, including P2- and P3-pDC differentiation, the expression of maturation markers, and the production of interferon- and inflammatory cytokines.

Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.","Riiser, K.; Helseth, S.; Haraldstad, K.; Torbjornsen, A.; Richardsen, K.

266,"Distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA","Evidence-based public health approaches that minimize the introduction and spread of new SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters are urgently needed in the United States and other countries struggling with expanding epidemics. Here we analyze 247 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA, and find surprisingly distinct patterns of viral spread. Dane County had the 12th known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, but this did not lead to descendant community spread. Instead, the Dane County outbreak was seeded by multiple later introductions, followed by limited community spread. In contrast, relatively few introductions in Milwaukee County led to extensive community spread. We present evidence for reduced viral spread in both counties, and limited viral transmission between counties, following the statewide Safer-at-Home public health order, which went into effect 25 March 2020.

267,Repeat SARS-CoV-2 Testing Models for Residential College Populations,"Residential colleges are considering re-opening under uncertain futures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.

In this paper, we combine several administrative data sources to estimate the relationship between mortality due to COVID-19 and poverty at a very local level (i.e. the municipality level) in France, one of the most severely hit country in the world. We find strong evidence of an income gradient in the impact of the pandemic on mortality: it is twice as large in the poorest municipalities compared to other municipalities. We then show that both poor housing conditions and higher occupational exposure are likely mechanisms. Overall, these mechanisms accounts for up to 60% of the difference observed between rich and poor municipalities.","Brandily, P.; Brebion, C.; Briole, S.; Khoury, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149955v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149955v1?rss=1,2020-07-10,2020-07-10,,True

However, Venezuelan ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region.

A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.","Paniz-Mondolfi, A.; Munoz, M.; Florez, C.; Gomez, S.; Rico, A.; Pardo, L.; Barros, E.

270,Severe SAR-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting indysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 10 million people worldwide with mortality exceeding half a million patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age,hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Clear mechanistic understanding of how these comorbidities converge to enable severe infection is lacking. Notably each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome and this disruption may be a unifying feature of severe COVID-19. Here we provide the first in depth interrogation of lipidomic changes, including structural-lipids as well as the eicosanoids and docosanoids lipid mediators (LMs), that mark COVID-19 disease severity. Our data reveal that progression from moderate to severe disease is marked by a loss of specific immune regulatory LMs and increased pro-inflammatory species. Given the important immune regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into the immune balance in COVID-19 and potential targets for therapy with currently approved pharmaceuticals.","Schwarz, B.; Sharma, L.; Roberts, L.; Peng, X.; Bermejo, S.; Leighton, I.; Massana, A.

271,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests with different antigen targets,"Background These last months, dozens of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests have become available with varying performances. A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests. Methods In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response, and that anti-nucleocapside (anti-N) antibodies appeared earlier than the anti-spike (anti-S) proteins. Conclusions The identified SARS-CoV-2 serology tests may be used for the diagnostic of CoviD-19 for negative RT-PCR patients presenting severe to mild suggestive symptoms or particular clinical presentation. Detection of both anti-N and anti-S could be complementary to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.","Coste, A.

Serological tests are critically important to determine exposure and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 within both individuals and populations. We completed SARS-CoV-2 serological testing of 1,293 parturient women at two centers in Philadelphia from April 4 to June 3, 2020. We tested 834 pre-pandemic samples collected in 2019 and 15 samples from COVID-19 recovered donors to validate our assay, which has a ~1% false positive rate. We found 80/1,293 (6.2%) of parturient women possessed IgG and/or IgM SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We found race/ethnicity differences in seroprevalence rates, with higher rates in Black/non-Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino women. Of the 72 seropositive women who also received nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction testing during pregnancy, 46 (64%) were positive. Continued serologic surveillance among pregnant women may inform perinatal clinical practices and can potentially be used to estimate seroprevalence within the community.","Flannery, D.

273,"Clinical, Behavioral and Social Factors Associated with Racial Disparities in Hospitalized and Ambulatory COVID-19 Patients from an Integrated Health Care System in Georgia","Introduction: Racial and ethnic minorities have shouldered a disproportioned burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection to date in the US, but data on the various drivers of these disparities is limited. Objectives: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients and explore factors associated with hospitalization risk by race. Methods: Case series of 448 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA), an integrated health care system serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, from March 3 to May 12, 2020. KPGA members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Multivariable analyses for hospitalization risk also included an additional 3489 persons under investigation (PUI) with suspected infection. COVID-19 treatment and outcomes, underlying comorbidities and quality of care management metrics, socio-demographic and other individual and community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. Results: Of 448 COVID-19 positive members, 68,3% was non-Hispanic Black (n=306), 18% non-Hispanic White (n=81) and 13,7% Other race (n=61). Median age was 54 [IQR 43-63) years. Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups. Beyond well-known physiologic and clinical factors, individual and community-level social indicators and health behaviors must be considered as interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 disparities and the systemic effects of racism are implemented.","Lobelo, F.; Bienvenida, A.

274,"D614G Spike Variant Does Not Alter IgG, IgM, or IgA Spike Seroassay Performance","Emergence of a new variant of spike protein (D614G) with increased infectivity and transmissibility has prompted many to analyze the potential role of this variant in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants. This is an important finding both for SARS-CoV-2 disease biology and for potential antibody-based therapeutics.","Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Hicks, J.; Mehalko, J.; Drew, M.; Memoli, M.

275,Genomic variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Gujarat: Underlying role of variants in disease epidemiology,"Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over 10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.

Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences. Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis.

276,Discriminating Mild from Critical COVID-19 by Innate and Adaptive Immune Single-cell Profiling of Bronchoalveolar Lavages,"How innate and adaptive lung immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 synchronize during COVID-19 pneumonitis and regulate disease severity is poorly established. To address this, we applied single-cell profiling to bronchoalveolar lavages from 44 patients with mild or critical COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia as control. Viral RNA-tracking delineated the infection phenotype to epithelial cells, but positioned mainly neutrophils at the forefront of viral clearance activity during COVID-19. In mild disease, neutrophils could execute their antiviral function in an immunologically  controlled fashion, regulated by fully-differentiated T-helper-17 (TH17)-cells, as well as T-helper-1 (TH1)-cells, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and partially-exhausted (TEX) T-cells with good effector functions. This was paralleled by  orderly phagocytic disposal of dead/stressed cells by fully-differentiated macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, hence facilitating lung tissue repair. In critical disease, CD4+ TH1- and CD8+ TEX-cells were characterized by inflammation-associated stress and metabolic exhaustion, while CD4+ TH17- and CD8+ TRM-cells failed to differentiate. Consequently, T-cell effector function was largely impaired thereby possibly facilitating excessive neutrophil-based inflammation. This was accompanied by impaired monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, with monocytes exhibiting an ATP-purinergic signalling-inflammasome footprint, thereby enabling COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsening disease severity.

This current poses great challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Objective: To make a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients. Methods: HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5 Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics, laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) , and other indicators between the two groups.

279,A Holistic Approach to Identification of Covid-19 Patients from Chest X-Ray Images utilizing Transfer Based Learning,"Novel coronavirus likewise called COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now outspread over the world. Around 8 millions of individuals previously got influenced by novel coronavirus and it causes at any rate 500,000 deaths. There are just about 90,000 individuals contaminated by COVID-19 in Bangladesh too. As it is an exceptionally new pandemic infection, its diagnosis is challenging for the medical community. In regular cases, it is hard for lower incoming countries to test cases easily. RT-PCR test is the most generally utilized analysis framework for COVID-19 patient detection. However, by utilizing X-ray image based programmed recognition can diminish the expense and testing time. So according to handling this test, it is important to program and effective recognition to forestall transmission to others. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish COVID-19 patients by chest X-ray images. We execute different pre-trained deep neural system models, for example, Sequential, DenseNet121, ResNet152 and EfficientNetB4 to assess the most productive outcome. And aims to utilize transfer-based learning. We assess this outcome by AUC, where EfficientNetB4 has 0.997 AUC, ResNet50 has 0.967 AUC, DenseNet121 has 0.874 AUC and the Sequential model has 0.762 AUC individually.

280,IL-33 expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 correlates with seropositivity in COVID-19 convalescent individuals,"Our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still developing. We investigated seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms, but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive, highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort. We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist- activation revealed an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1{beta}+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33- producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV- 2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","Stanczak, M. A.; Sanin, D.

281,Validation and comparison of PICTURE analytic and Epic Deterioration Index for COVID-19,"Introduction The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented strain on healthcare facilities across the United States. Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. We compare PICTURE to the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), a widespread system which has recently been assessed for use to triage COVID-19 patients. Methods The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to the EDI for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death) at two levels of granularity: (1) maximum score across an encounter with a minimum lead time before the first adverse event and (2) predictions at every observation with instances in the last 24 hours before the adverse event labeled as positive. PICTURE and the EDI were also compared on the encounter level using different lead times extending out to 24 hours. Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. Results PICTURE successfully delineated between high- and low-risk patients and consistently outperformed the EDI in both of our cohorts. In non-COVID-19 patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) and AUPRC of 0.109 (0.089 - 0.125) on the observation level, compared to the EDI AUROC of 0.762 (0.746 - 0.780) and AUPRC of 0.077 (0.062 - 0.090). On COVID-19 positive patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC of 0.828 (0.794 - 0.869) and AUPRC of 0.160 (0.089 - 0.199), while the EDI scored an AUROC of 0.792 (0.754 - 0.835) and AUPRC of 0.131 (0.092 - 0.159). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). Conclusion The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering a potential incipient second wave of COVID-19 infections. PICTURE also has the ability to explain individual predictions to clinicians by ranking the most important features for a prediction. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","Cummings, B. C.; Ansari, S.; Motyka, J. R.; Wang, G.; Medlin, R. P.; Kronick, S.

282,Epidemiological model for the inhomogeneous spatial spreading of COVID-19 and other diseases,"We suggest a mathematical model for the spread of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to the COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume fast mixing of the population relative to the local infection rate, similar to the regime applicable to many chemical reactions. However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a ``reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas.","Tsori, Y.; Granek, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148767v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148767v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,True
283,Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Specific CD4(+) and CD8 (+) T Cell Responses Using MHC Class I and II Tetramers,"The success of SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) vaccines is measured by their ability to mount immune memory responses that are long-lasting. To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitch platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and a few MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind with multiple MHC molecule types. With the peptide exchange generated MHC tetramers, scientists can assess CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes.

284,Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe and fatal respiratory disease,"ABSTRACTThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has created an international health crisis. Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Joseph W.

285,Structures of potent and convergent neutralizing antibodies bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike unveil a unique epitope responsible for exceptional potency,"Understanding the mechanism of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for effective vaccines and therapeutics development. We recently reported an exceptionally potent NAb, BD-368-2, and revealed the existence of VH3-53/VH3-66 convergent NAbs in COVID-19. Here we report the 3.5-[A] cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2s Fabs in complex with a mutation-induced prefusion-state-stabilized spike trimer. Unlike VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 binding by occupying all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their ""up"" and ""down"" positions. BD-368-2 also triggers fusogenic-like structural rearrangements of the spike trimer, which could impede viral entry. Moreover, BD-368-2 completely avoids the common epitope of VH3-53/VH3-66 NAbs, evidenced by multiple crystal structures of their Fabs in tripartite complexes with RBD, suggesting a new way of pairing potent NAbs to prevent neutralization escape. Together, these results rationalize a unique epitope that leads to exceptional neutralization potency, and provide guidance for NAb therapeutics and vaccine designs against SARS-CoV-2.",Shuo Du; Yunlong Cao; Qinyu Zhu; Guopeng Wang; Xiaoxia Du; Runsheng He; Hua Xu; Yinghui Zheng; Bo Wang; Yali Bai; Chenggong Ji; Ayijiang Yisimayi; Qisheng Wang; Ning Gao; X.

286,"Comprehensive variant and haplotype landscapes of 50,500 global SARS-CoV-2 isolates and accelerating accumulation of country-private variant profiles","Understanding the genetic etiology of COVID-19 requires a comprehensive understanding of the variant and haplotype landscape of all reported genomes of SARS-COV-2, the causative virus of the disease. Country-, state/region- and possibly even city-private variant profiles may contribute to varied disease exemplifications and fatality rates observed across the globe along with host factors such as age, ethnicity and comorbidity. The Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) captures up-to-date fulllength SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ~50,500 isolates from GISAID, GenBank, CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine, and other sources (as of June 18, 2020). Among which, 49,637 isolates carry at least one variation from the reference genome NC_045512, a total of 6,070 variants and 2,513 haplotypes were detected in at least three isolates independently. Together, they constituted the most likely SARS-CoV-2 variant and haplotype landscapes world-wide currently.

Evidence supporting positive (orf3a, orf8, S genes) and purifying (M gene) selections were detected, which warrants further investigation. Most interestingly, we identified 1,583 countryprivate variants from 10,238 isolates (20.6% overall) reported in 48 countries. 807 countryprivate haplotypes, defined as a haplotype shared by at least 5 isolates all of which came from the same country, were identified in in 8,656 isolates from 39 countries. United Kingdom, USA, and Australia had 464, 166 and 32 private haplotypes respectively, comprising 22.4%, 16.6% and 16.4% of the isolates from each country. Together with their descendent and private haplotypes with fewer members, 22,171 (45.8%) isolates carried country-private haplotypes globally. The percentage were 28.2-29.6% in January to March, and rapidly increased to 46.4% and 59.6% in April and May, co-occurring with global travel restrictions. The localization of the variant profiles appeared to be similarly accelerating from 14.2% in March and 28.4% in April to over 40% isolates carrying the country-private variants around May.

In summary, a common pattern is seen world-wide in COVID-19 in which at the onset of disease there appeared to be a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 variants that accumulate quickly and then begin to rapidly coalesce into distinct haplotypes. This may be the result of localized outbreaks due to factors such as multiple points viral introduction, geographic separation and the introduction of policies such as travel restriction, social distancing and quarantine, resulting in the emergence of country-private haplotypes.",Lishuang Shen; Jennifer Dien Bard; Jaclyn A.

287,Screening and testing for a suitable untransfected cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies,"At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.

Author summaryIn the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.",Claudia Pommerenke; Ulfert Rand; Cord C.

288,Dual nature of human ACE2 glycosylation in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike,"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.",Ahmad Reza Mehdipour; Gerhard Hummer,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.193680v1?rss=1,2020-07-09,2020-07-09,,False
289,Human B cell clonal expansion and convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,"During virus infection B cells are critical for the production of antibodies and protective immunity. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of IGHV genes, progressing to a highly polyclonal response of B cells with broader IGHV gene usage and extensive class switching to IgG and IgA subclasses with limited somatic hypermutation in the initial weeks of infection. We identify extensive convergence of antibody sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped naive responses to this virus. Notably, sequence-based detection in COVID-19 patients of convergent B cell clonotypes previously reported in SARS-CoV infection predicts the presence of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibody titers specific for the receptor-binding domain.

290,Molecular architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 9-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The in situ architecture of the ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. These characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to an unprecedented resolution, and shed lights on how the virus packs its ~30 Kb long single-segmented RNA in the ~80 nm diameter lumen.

Symptomatic infection rates during the quarantine period in cabins with previous confirmed cases are compared to these in cabins without previous confirmed cases. Results: Symptomatic infection rate during the quarantine period in cabins with previously confirmed cases is not significantly higher than that in cabins without previously confirmed cases.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells and antibodies were characterized in patients with different COVID-19 related disease severity. Despite severe lymphopenia affecting all major lymphocyte subpopulations, patients with severe disease mounted significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells as compared to convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 T-cells dominated over CD8 T-cells and closely correlated with the number of plasmablasts and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA- and IgG-levels. Unlike in convalescents, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in patients with severe disease showed marked alterations in phenotypical and functional properties, which also extended to CD4 and CD8 T-cells in general.

The purpose of present study is to develop and apply a computational tool for predicting evolution of different epidemiological variables for COVID-19 in India. We propose a dynamic SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) and SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model for this purpose. In the dynamic model, time dependent infection rate is assumed for estimating evolution of different variables of the model. Parameter estimation of the model is the first step of the analysis which is performed by least square optimization of priori data. In the second step of the analysis, simulation is carried out by using evaluated parameters for prediction of the outbreak. The computational model has been validated against real data for COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Time to reach peak, peak infected cases and total reported cases were compared with actual data and found to be in very good agreement. Next the model is applied for the case of India and various Indian states to predict different epidemiological parameters. Priori data was taken from the beginning of nation-wide lockdown on 24 March to 6 July. It was found that peak of the outbreak may reach in the month of August-September with maximum 4-5 lakhs active cases at peak.

Decision tree model (sensitivity=100%, specificity=81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74 x109/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR=5.21), neutrophils (OR=6.25), D-dimer (OR=4.19), and prolonged PT (OR=2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR=13.87), CRP (OR=7.09), D-dimer (OR=6.36), and neutrophils (OR=6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality. Conclusions Several hematological and immunological markers, in particular neutrophilic count, could be helpful to be included within the routine panel for COVID-19 infection evaluation to ensure risk stratification and effective management.","Elshazli, R.

300,Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases,"BackgroundLittle is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases.

Methods and findingsWe explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3 (3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were all negative.

301,Digestive Manifestations in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"Background: The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in COVID-19 remain uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.","Elmunzer, B.

302,"Risk Factors Prediction, Clinical Outcomes, and Mortality of COVID-19 Patients","Background: Preventing communicable diseases requires understanding the spread, epidemiology, clinical features, progression, and prognosis of the disease. Early identification of risk factors and clinical outcomes might help to identify critically ill patients, provide proper treatment and prevent mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19. Interpretation: Finding clinical symptoms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical part of prevention. These symptoms can help in the assessment of disease progression.

303,"Assessment of N95 and K95 respirator decontamination: fiber integrity, filtration efficiency, and dipole charge density.","Personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 respirators are critical for persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2. KN95 respirators and N95 decontamination protocols have been described as solutions to a lack of such PPE. However, there are a few materials science studies that characterize the charge distribution and physical changes accompanying disinfection treatments particularly heating. Here, we report the filtration efficiency, dipole charge density, and fiber integrity of pristine N95 and KN95 respirators before and after various decontamination methods. We found that the filter layer of N95 is 8-fold thicker than that of KN95, which explains its 10% higher filtration efficiency (97.03 %) versus KN95 (87.76 %) under pristines condition. After 60 minutes of 70 {degrees}C treatment, the filtration efficiency and dipole charge density of N95 became 97.16% and 12.48 {micro}C/m2, while those of KN95 were 83.64% and 1.48 {micro}C/m2 ; moreover, fit factor of N95 was 55 and that of KN95 was 2.7. In conclusion, the KN95 respirator is an inferior alternative of N95 respirator.

304,Structural basis for helicase-polymerase coupling in the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated-transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryo-electron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template-product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirus-order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12-thumb. The structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 function. We also observe ADP-Mg2+ bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral therapeutic development.",James Chen; Brandon Malone; Eliza Llewellyn; Michael Grasso; Patrick M.

305,In vivo structural characterization of the whole SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome identifies host cell target proteins vulnerable to re-purposed drugs,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family that is the causal pathogen of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Lei Sun; Pan Li; Xiaohui Ju; Jian Rao; Wenze Huang; Shaojun Zhang; Tuanlin Xiong; Kui Xu; Xiaolin Zhou; Lili Ren; Qiang Ding; Jianwei Wang; Qiangfeng Cliff Zhang,"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.192732v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,False

308,Continuous flexibility analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike prefusion structures,"With the help of novel processing workflows and algorithms, we have obtained a better understanding of the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion state. We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",Roberto Melero; Carlos Oscar S.

309,SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Rates of Children in Louisiana During the State Stay at Home Order.,"Children (less than 19 years) account for 20% of the US population but currently represent less than 2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Because infected children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in children is poorly understood. METHODS During the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood samples from 812 individuals from a Childrens Hospital were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical records were compared with local COVID-19 cases. RESULTS In total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11 years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test. Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish. CONCLUSION In a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location, race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported and may have contributed to virus transmission.","Dietrich, M. L.; Norton, E.

The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in states with high population densities, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania showing the strongest predictive results.

311,Atypical Presentations of COVID-19 in Care Home Residents presenting to Secondary Care: A UK Single Centre Study,"Background: The United Kingdom (UK) care home population has experienced high mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium. Individuals presenting atypically, especially with anorexia, have higher mortality.","Rawle, M.

312,Artificial intelligence driven assessment of routinely collected healthcare data is an effective screening test for COVID-19 in patients presenting to hospital,"The early clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be difficult to distinguish from other undifferentiated medical presentations to hospital, however viral specific real- time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has limited sensitivity and can take up to 48 hours for operational reasons. In this study, we develop two early-detection models to identify COVID-19 using routinely collected data typically available within one hour (laboratory tests, blood gas and vital signs) during 115,394 emergency presentations and 72,310 admissions to hospital. Our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (AUROC 0.939) for COVID- 19 amongst all patients attending hospital, and Admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset admitted to hospital. Both models achieve high negative predictive values (>99%) across a range of prevalences (<5%), facilitating rapid exclusion during triage to guide infection control. We prospectively validated our models across all patients presenting and admitted to a large UK teaching hospital group in a two-week test period, achieving 92.3% (n= 3,326, NPV: 97.6%, AUROC: 0.881) and 92.5% accuracy (n=1,715, NPV: 97.7%, AUROC: 0.871) in comparison to RT-PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improves apparent accuracy (95.1% and 94.1%) and NPV (99.0% and 98.5%). Our artificial intelligence models perform effectively as a screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments and hospital admission units, offering high impact in settings where rapid testing is unavailable.","Soltan, A.

Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 11 COVID-19 patients. Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 2,600 samples derived from 11 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host.","Ulas, T.; Seep, L.; Schulte-Schrepping, J.; De Domenico, E.; Mengiste, S.; Theis, H.; Kraut, M.; Becker, M.; Gierlich, J.; Lenkeit, L.; Drews, A.; van Uelft, M.; Dahm, K.; Agrawal, S.; Gemuend, I.

314,"A national cross-sectional survey of public perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Efforts to mitigate the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have largely relied on broad compliance with public health recommendations, yet navigating the high volume of evolving information and misinformation related to SARS-CoV-2 can be challenging. We assessed national public perceptions (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) related to COVID-19 in Canada to understand public perspectives and inform future public health initiatives. Methods: We administered a national online survey with the goal of obtaining responses from 2000 adults residing in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize respondent characteristics and tested for significant overall regional differences using chi-squared tests and t-tests, as appropriate. Results: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% either self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified regional differences in perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion: We found that knowledge about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Parsons Leigh, J.; Fiest, K.; Brundin-Mather, R.; Plonikoff, K.; Soo, A.; Sypes, E.

315,Optimally Pooled Viral Testing,"It has long been known that pooling samples may be used to minimize the total number of tests required in order to identify each infected individual in a population. Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection probability, but remains better than non-pooled testing up to an infection probability of 30%. The present predictions imply that optimal pooling may be used to extremely efficiently test populations with infection percentages down to 0.1%, in which case a single round of optimal pooling with an average of as few as 6 tests may be sufficient to uniquely identify every infected individual in a population of 100 (and increases to 20 tests when at 1% infection). Additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooled testing, thus reducing the average number of tests required to test a population with 1% infection from 20 to 14 out of 100 (and from 6 to 4 with 0.1% infections). These best case predictions, obtained assuming perfect test accuracy and specificity, provide a quantitative measure of the optimal pool size and expected testing efficiency gains in populations with infection probabilities ranging from 0.1% to 30%, and are supported by recent COVID-19 detection sensitivity and optimized pool size experiments.","Ben-Amotz, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20145805v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
316,High excess mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm Region areas with young and socially vulnerable populations,"Background: We aimed to describe the distribution of excess mortality (EM) during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, according to individual age and sex, and the sociodemographic context Methods: Weekly all-cause mortality data were obtained from Statistics Sweden for the period 01/01/2015 to 17/05/2020. EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2,379,792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+ year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. Findings: An EM was first detected during the week of March 23-29 2020. During the peaking week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 160% was observed: 211% in 80+ year-old women; 179% in 80+ year-old men. During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%), and lowest share of gainfully employed (174%). There was a 1.2 to 1.7-fold increase in EM between those areas with a higher vs. lower proportion of young people. Interpretation: Living in areas with lower socioeconomic status and younger populations is linked to COVID-19 EM. These conditions might have facilitated the viral spread. Our findings add to the well-known biological vulnerability linked to increasing age, the relevance of the sociodemographic context when estimating the individual risk to COVID-19.","Calderon-Larranaga, A.; Vetrano, D.

317,The COVID-19 mortality effects of underlying health conditions in India: a modelling study,"Objective: To model how known COVID-19 comorbidities will affect mortality rates and the age distribution of mortality in a large lower middle income country (India), as compared with a high income country (England), and to identify which health conditions drive any differences. Design: Modelling study. Setting: England and India. Participants: 1,375,548 respondents aged 18 to 99 to the District Level Household Survey-4 and Annual Health Survey in India. Additional information on health condition prevalence on individuals aged 18 to 99 was obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries Studies (GBD). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportional increase in age-specific mortality in each country due to the prevalence of each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic heart disease, respiratory illness, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer, among others). The combined change in overall mortality and the share of deaths under 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. Results: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs. 8.5%), chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs. 2.5%), and kidney disease (9.7% vs. 5.6%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs. 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs. 5.9%), and cancer (0.3% vs. 2.8%). Population COVID-19 mortality in India relative to England is most increased by diabetes (+5.4%) and chronic respiratory disease (+2.3%), and most reduced by obesity (-9.7%), cancer (-3.2%), and chronic heart disease (-1.9%). Overall, comorbidities lower mortality in India relative to England by 9.7%. Accounting for demographics and population health explains a third of the difference in share of deaths under age 60 between the two countries. Conclusions: Known COVID-19 health risk factors are not expected to have a large effect on aggregate mortality or its age distribution in India relative to England. The high share of COVID-19 deaths from people under 60 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unexplained. Understanding mortality risk associated with health conditions prevalent in LMICs, such as malnutrition and HIV/AIDS, is essential for understanding differential mortality.

318,Ultrametric model for covid-19 dynamics: an attempt to explain slow approaching herd immunity in Sweden,"We present a mathematical model of infection dynamics that might explain slower approaching the herd immunity during the covid-19 epidemy in Sweden than it was predicted by a variety of other models; see graphs Fig. 2. The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchy's levels) barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This model's feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19 epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of ""super-spreaders"" who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection. In future, this model will be completed by adding the SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19 spreading.","Khrennikov, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146209v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.20146209v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True

The AnshLabs gave higher estimates of sero-prevalence, over the three RAIA methods. For positive results, AnshLabs had 93.3% and 100% concordance with DiaSorin or Abbott and Roche respectively. For negative results, AnshLabs had 69.7% and 73.0% concordance with DiaSorin and Roche or Abbott respectively.

320,Reflection of connectivism in medical education and learning motivation 4 during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected the global healthcare and economy but threatened the world of education altogether. Malaysia is not spared from this pandemic as all universities were forced to close and initiate online learning with the implementation of Movement Control Order since mid-March 2020.The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning definitely deserves a reflection on how it affects the learning motivation among medical students. Hence, this is the first study that compares the effect of digital learning on learning motivation among medical students in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A modified Students Motivation towards Science Learning (SMTSL) was used to assess the learning motivation of UKM medical students throughout Year 1-5. The number of students that use digital learning during COVID-19 is significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 (p<0.05). However, there is no significant difference (p=0.872) in learning motivation among medical students before and during COVID-19 crisis. Higher frequency in digital learning usage frequency does not exert a great impact on learning motivation. Reflections from each participant were collated to justify the current situation. This could be due to motivation coming from the very choice to pursue medicine as a doctor, which is mainly influenced by intrinsic motivation, and ability to adapt in difficult situations. Thus, medical educators should be creative in enhancing extrinsic motivation by making use of digital learning as a platform so that medical students are able to independently fish for information in the vast pool of digital information and apply in actual medical practice in the future for life-long learning.","Ismail, N.

321,Novel SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody and neutralization assays reveal wide range of humoral immune response during COVID-19,"Development of antibody protection during SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) infection is a pressing question for public health and for vaccine development. We developed highly sensitive CoV-2-specific antibody and neutralization assays. CoV-2 Spike protein or Nucleocapsid protein specific IgG antibodies at titers more than 1:100,000 were detectable in all PCR+ subjects (n=87) and were absent in the negative controls. Other isotype antibodies (IgA, IgG1-4) were also detected. CoV-2 neutralization was determined in COVID-19 and convalescent plasma up to 10,000-fold dilution, using Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviruses, which was also blocked by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Hospitalized patients had up to 3000-fold higher antibody and neutralization titers compared to outpatients or convalescent plasma donors. Further, subjects who donated plasma further out from the diagnosis of COVID-19 appeared to have lower titers. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients also contained NAbs against SARS Spike protein pseudovirus. Together these results demonstrate the high specificity and sensitivity of our assays, which may impact understanding the quality or duration of the antibody response during COVID-19 and in determining the effectiveness of potential vaccines.","Dogan, M.; Kozhaya, L.; Placek, L.; Gunter, C.; Yigit, M.; Hardy, R.; Plassmeyer, M.; Coatney, P.; Lillard, K.; Bukhari, Z.; Kleinberg, M.; Hayes, C.; Arditi, M.; Klapper, E.; Merin, N.; Liang, B.

322,Modeling reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and hospital burden achieved by prioritizing testing using a clinical prediction rule,"Prompt identification of cases is critical for slowing the spread of COVID-19. However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. 'flattens the curve'), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden. In conclusion, we present a novel approach to evidence-based allocation of limited diagnostic capacity, to achieve public health goals for COVID-19.","Reimer, J. R.; Ahmed, S.

323,Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were often implemented under considerable uncertainty and a lack of scientific evidence. Assessing the effectiveness of the individual interventions is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 4,579 NPIs implemented in 76 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We use a hierarchically coded data set of NPIs and propose a novel modelling approach that combines four computational techniques, which together allow for a worldwide consensus rank of the NPIs based on their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We show how the effectiveness of individual NPIs strongly varies across countries and world regions, and in relation to human and economic development as well as different dimensions of governance. We quantify the effectiveness of each NPI with respect to the epidemic age of its adoption, i.e., how early into the epidemics. The emerging picture is one in which no one-fits-all solution exists, and no single NPI alone can decrease Rt below one and that a combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. We show that there are NPIs considerably less intrusive and costly than lockdowns that are also highly effective, such as certain risk communication strategies and voluntary measures that strengthen the healthcare system. By allowing to simulate ``what-if'' scenarios at the country level, our approach opens the way for planning the most likely effectiveness of future NPIs.","Haug, N.; Geyrhofer, L.; Londei, A.; Dervic, E.; Desvars-Larrive, A.; Loreto, V.; Pinior, B.; Thurner, S.; Klimek, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147199v1?rss=1,2020-07-08,2020-07-08,,True
324,Reconstructing the global dynamics of under-ascertained COVID-19 cases and infections,"Background: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= to 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as an assumed baseline. We then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: We estimate that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. Despite low case detection in some countries, our results that adjust for this still suggest that all countries have had only a small fraction of their populations infected as of July 2020. Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","Golding, N.; Russell, T.

After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67/68).

326,Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence Amidst Community-Acquired Respiratory Viruses,"Background. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 as new cause of severe viral pneumonia (CoVID-19) reaching Europe by late January 2020. We validated the WHO-recommended assay and describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs). Methods. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 individuals were prospectively tested by the Basel-S-gene and the WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 together with SARS-CoV-2. Results. Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) positive samples. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 NOPS. Adults were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while children were more likely to test CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced other CARVs within 3 weeks reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhino/enterovirus (13%), influenzavirus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial (6%) and metapneumovirus (6%). Conclusions. The differential diagnosis for respiratory infections was broad during the early pandemic, affecting infection control and treatment decisions.

327,COVID-19 Mortality Risk Assessment: An International Multi-Center Study,"Background: Timely identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality can significantly improve patient management and resource allocation within hospitals. This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. Findings: The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ([&le;] 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([&ge;] 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen ([&ge;] 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine ([&ge;] 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. Interpretation: The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","Bertsimas, D.; Lukin, G.; Mingardi, L.; Nohadani, O.; Orfanoudaki, A.; Stellato, B.; Wiberg, H.; Cisneros-Herreros, J.

328,No evidence of viral polymorphisms associated with Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated With SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS).,"Generally, children and teenagers do not become seriously ill with COVID-19. However, in countries with high rates of coronavirus disease, children with the syndrome COVID-19 associated inflammation syndrome referred to as PIMS-TS have been reported. Similarities noted between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences and those of other super antigens has prompted the suggestion that this might be the mechanism by SARS-CoV-ST triggers PIMS-TS. It has also been suggested that the D614G variant found more commonly in the US and across European countries may explain why PIMS-TS appears to be common in these countries. Here we analysed viral sequences from 13 paediatric COVID-19 patients of whom five were diagnosed with PIMS-TS. This is the first characterisation of viruses from PIMS-TS patients. In contrast to what has been hypothesised, we found no evidence of unique sequences associated with the viruses from PIMS-TS patients.","Pang, J.; Boshier, F. A.

329,Effectiveness of Ivermectin as add-on Therapy in COVID-19 Management (Pilot Trial),"Background: To date no effective therapy has been demonstrated for COVID-19. In vitro, studies indicated that ivermectin (IVM) has antiviral effect. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg /kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+/-}2.75 versus 13.22 {+/-}.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82).

330,SARS-CoV-2 infection induces germinal center responses with robust stimulation of CD4 T follicular helper cells in rhesus macaques,"CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important for the generation of long-lasting and specific humoral protection against viral infections. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates Tfh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic. Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating Tfh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis. The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a Th1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection. We also observed the generation of germinal center Tfh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies. Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity.",Sonny R. Elizaldi; Yashavanth Shaan Lakshmanappa; Jamin W. Roh; Brian A.

331,Forcing Seasonality of influenza-like epidemics with daily Solar resonance,"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","Nicastro, F.; Sironi, G.; Antonello, E.; Bianco, A.; Biasin, M.; Brucato, J.

332,Towards the design of multiepitope-based peptide vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities. This respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal. Currently, no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide. The spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. This viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine. Previously, we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases. In the current study, we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach. This construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity, low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build. The population coverage of the used T-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles. The vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis.

333,Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations,"AimThe novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 10 million people and caused 500K deaths worldwide. In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries.

MethodsAn extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with {+/-}1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/).

ResultsA total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction.

334,"An Agent Based Modeling of COVID-19: Validation, Analysis, and Recommendations","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an ongoing pandemic worldwide. Countries have adopted Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an Agent Based Model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The Agent Based Model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of daily confirmed cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford county, Kansas, USA. Different interventions including contact tracing are applied on a scaled down version of New York city, USA and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with a city-wide lock-down results in the effective reproduction number (Rt) to fall below 1 within three weeks of intervention. In the case of 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated and the spread is contained within three months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lock-down can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lock-down can go a long way to contain the spread. No particular funding was available for this project.","Shamil, M. S.; Farheen, F.; Ibtehaz, N.; Khan, I. M.; Rahman, M.

335,The benefits of peer transparency in safe workplace operation post pandemic lockdown,"The benefits, both in terms of productivity and public health, are investigated for different levels of engagement with the test, trace and isolate procedures in the context of a pandemic in which there is little or no herd immunity. Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a ""playable model"" in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in maximising productivity and minimising overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed on how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","Wey, A.; Champneys, A.

336,Rapid Systematic Review Exploring Historical and Present Day National and International Governance during Pandemics,"Introduction Pandemics have plagued mankind since records began, and while non-communicable disease pandemics are more common in high-income nations, infectious disease pandemics continue to affect all countries worldwide. To mitigate impact, national pandemic preparedness and response policies remain crucial. And in response to emerging pathogens of pandemic potential, public health policies must be both dynamic and adaptive. Yet, this process of policy change and adaptation remains opaque. Accordingly, this rapid systematic review will synthesise and analyse evaluative policy literature to develop a roadmap of policy changes that have occurred after each pandemic event, throughout both the 20th and 21st Century, in order to better inform future policy development. Methods and Analysis A rapid systematic review will be conducted to assimilate and synthesise both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature that document the then current pandemic preparedness policy, and the subsequent changes to that policy, across high-, middle- and low-income countries. The rapid review will follow the PRISMA guidelines, and the literature search will be performed across five relevant databases, as well as various government websites to scan for grey literature. Articles will be screen against pre-agreed inclusion/ exclusion criteria, and data will be extracted using a pre-defined charting table. Ethics and Dissemination All data rely on secondary, publicly available data sources; therefore no ethical clearance is required.

337,Risk of Transmission of infection to Healthcare Workers delivering Supportive Care for Coronavirus Pneumonia;A Rapid GRADE Review,"Abstract Background: Avenues of treatment currently implemented for Covid-19 pandemic are largely supportive in nature. Non -availability of an effective antiviral treatment makes supportive care for acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the most crucial intervention. Highly contagious nature of Covid-19 had created stress and confusion among front line Health Care Workers (HCWs) regarding infectious risk of supportive interventions and best preventive strategies. Purpose: To analyze and summarize key evidence from published literature exploring the risk of transmission of Covid-19 related to common supportive care interventions in hospitalized patients and effectiveness of currently used preventive measures in hospital setting. Data Sources: Curated Covid-19 literature from NCBI Computational Biology Branch ,Embase and Ovid till May 20,2020.Longitudinal and reference search till June 28,2020 Study Selection: Studies pertaining to risk of infection to HCWs providing standard supportive care of hospitalized Covid-19 mainly focusing on respiratory support interventions.Indirect studies from SARS,MERS or other ARDS pathology caused by infectious agents based on reference tracking and snow ball search . Clinical, Healthy volunteer and mechanistic studies were included. Two authors independently screened studies for traditional respiratory supportive-care (Hypoxia management, ventilatory support and pulmonary toileting) related transmission of viral or bacterial pneumonia to HCWs. Data Extraction: Two authors (TK and SP) independently screened articles and verified for consensus. Quality of studies and level of evidence was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) , Newcastle - Ottawa quality assessment Scale for observational studies and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence. Data Synthesis: 21 studies were eligible for inclusion. In 11 mechanistic studies, 7 were manikin based,1 was in the setting of GNB pneumonia ,2 were healthy volunteer study and 1 was heterogenous setting.Out of 10 clinical studies ,5 were case controlled and 6 were cohort studies. Risk of corona virus transmission was significantly high in HCWs performing or assisting endotracheal intubation or contact with respiratory secretion.(Moderate certainty evidence, GRADE B) Safety of nebulization treatment in corona virus pneumonia patients are questionable(Low certainty evidence, GRADE C).Very low certainty evidence exist for risk of transmission with conventional HFNC (GRADE D) and NIV (GRADE D),CPR (GRADE D),Bag and mask ventilation(GRADE D).Moderate certainty evidence exist for protective effect of wearing a multilayered mask, gown , eye protection and formal training for PPE use (GRADE B).Low certainty evidence exist for transmission risk with bag and mask ventilation, suctioning before and after intubation and prolonged exposure (GRADE C).Certainty of evidence for wearing gloves,post exposure hand washing and wearing N 95 mask is low(GRADE C). Limitations: This study was limited to articles with English abstract. Highly dynamic nature of body of literature related to Covid-19, frequent updates were necessary even during preparation of manuscript and longitudinal search was continued even after finalizing initial search. Due to the heterogeneity and broad nature of the search protocol, quantitative comparisons regarding the effectiveness of included management strategies could not be performed. Direct evidence was limited due to poor quality and non-comparative nature of available Covid-19 reporting. Conclusions: Major risk factors for transmission of corona virus infection were, performing or assisting endotracheal intubation and contact with respiratory secretion. Risk of transmission with HFNC or NIV can be significantly decreased by helmet interface, modified exhalation circuit or placing a properly fitting face mask over patient interface of HFNC. Evidence for risk of transmission with CPR, suctioning before or after intubation or bag and mask ventilation of very low certainty. Significant protective factors are Formal training for PPE use, consistently wearing mask, gown and eye protection.

Genomic surveillance showed 9 introductions of three distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based analyses yielded an R0 estimate of 10 4.4 (95% confidence interval: 2.0-7.7), suggesting intense spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. RT-PCR-based tests 11 were highly sensitive but showed variation of internal controls and between diagnostic targets. Commercially available 12 SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs showed up to 25% false-positive results depending on antigen and antibody types, likely due 13 to unspecific antibody responses elicited by acute malaria according to lack of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing 14 antibody responses and relatively higher parasitemia in those sera. 15 We confirm an overload of the diagnostic capacity in Benin and provide baseline information on the usability of 16 genome-based surveillance in resource-limited settings.

We evaluated the analytical performance of two rapid nucleic acid tests, Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Mobidiag Novodiag(R) Covid-19, in comparison to a combination reference of three large-scale PCR tests. Moreover, utility of the Novodiag(R) test in tertiary care emergency departments was assessed. In the preliminary evaluation, analysis of 90 respiratory samples resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for Xpert(R), whereas analysis of 107 samples resulted in 93.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Novodiag(R). Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing with Novodiag(R) was made available for four tertiary care emergency departments in Helsinki, Finland between 18 and 31 May, coinciding with a rapidly declining epidemic phase. Altogether 361 respiratory specimens, together with relevant clinical data, were analyzed with Novodiag(R) and reference tests: 355/361 of the specimens were negative with both methods, and 1/361 was positive in Novodiag(R) and negative by the reference method. Of the 5 remaining specimens, two were negative with Novodiag(R), but positive with the reference method with late Ct values. On average, a test result using Novodiag(R) was available nearly 8 hours earlier than that obtained with the large-scale PCR tests. While the performance of novel sample-to-answer PCR tests need to be carefully evaluated, they may provide timely and reliable results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 and thus facilitate patient management including effective cohorting.","Jokela, P.; Jääskeläinen, A.

Conclusions: Recommended dose chloroquine treatment results in plasma concentrations that are unlikely to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, the incidence of QTc prolongation was high. The preclinical promise of chloroquine as antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19 is overshadowed by its cardiac toxicity and lack of effective exposure. It is unlikely that a positive clinical effect will be found with chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.","Bruggemann, R. J. M.; Moes, D. J. A. R.; van Rhee, K. p.; van 't Veer, N. E.; Koch, B. C.

341,A rapidly adaptable biomaterial vaccine for SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Langellotto, F.; Seiler, B.

342,Spike protein fusion loop controls SARS-CoV-2 fusogenicity and infectivity,"The Spike is a hallmark coronavirus protein that determines virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We have investigated the Spike from six β-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines has been inferred from comparative studies of their deletion mutant in a fellow murine β-coronavirus MHV-A59 that show significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo. The Spike cleavage-linked priming and fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.Summary The Spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface is the prime mediator of COVID-191 because of its central role in virus-host attachment, virus-entry, and virus-spread2. The contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been attributed to dense glycosylation of the Spike glycoprotein3, its high affinity of binding to human ACE2 receptor4, and cleavage5. While these may be imperative, it does not explain the uncontrolled infectivity. Here we show that properties of the fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop of SARS-CoV-2 Spike that triggers the virus fusion, distinguishes it from the other five β-coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic, including the surface contributed by the fusion peptides. The fusion peptides are structurally rigid owing to its consecutive prolines, aromatic/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive β-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The role of rigidity accrued from the presence of consecutive prolines contributing to virus fusogenicity can be deciphered from our previous murine β-coronavirus, MHV-A59 studies6. The synergy brought about by the global location of the surface exposed fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the fusion process, which may explain the severity of the infection and widespread nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Pal, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191973v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
343,"Genes Encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Related Proteins Mediating SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry are Upregulated with Age in Human Cardiomyocytes","Age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in patients following COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Robinson, E.

344,Single source of pangolin CoVs with a near identical Spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2,"Multiple publications have independently described pangolin CoV genomes from the same batch of smuggled pangolins confiscated in Guangdong province in March, 2019. We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, Y.

345,Alignment of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks by integer linear programming: SARS-CoV-2,"Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","Llabres, M.; Valiente, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,False
346,Favipiravir and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hamster model,"SummaryThere is a need for safe and effective antiviral molecules with which to combat COVID-19 pandemics. Recently, in vitro inhibitory activity of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 was reported. Here, we used a Syrian hamster model to explore the pharmacokinetics of this molecule and its in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Results revealed that high doses (700-1400mg/kg/day) significantly reduced virus replication in the lungs accompanied by clinical alleviation of the disease. However, these high doses were associated with significant toxicity in hamsters. Favipiravir pharmacokinetics displayed non-linear increase in plasma exposure between the doses and good lung penetration. Analysis of viral genomes in vivo showed that favipiravir induced a mutagenic effect. Whilst the plasma trough concentrations observed in this study were comparable with those previously found during human clinical trials, this potential toxicity requires further investigation to assess whether a tolerable dosing regimen can be found in humans that effectively reduces virus replication.Competing Interest StatementJeremie Guedj has consulted for F.

347,The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, ~30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to locate regions of high base pair content across this long genome and also identify well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity to stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most highly structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis reveals varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts. The conclusions reported in this study provide a foundation for structure-function hypotheses in SARS-CoV-2 biology, and in turn, may guide the 3D structural characterization of potential RNA drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics.View Full Text","Tavares, R. d.

By combining cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical experiments, we show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binds to the human 40S subunit in ribosomal complexes including the 43S pre-initiation complex. The protein inserts its C-terminal domain at the entrance to the mRNA channel where it interferes with mRNA binding. We observe potent translation inhibition in the presence of Nsp1 in lysates from human cells. Based on the high-resolution structure of the 40S-Nsp1 complex, we identify residues of Nsp1 crucial for mediating translation inhibition. We further show that the full-length 5’ untranslated region of the genomic viral mRNA stimulates translation in vitro, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 combines inhibition of translation by Nsp1 with efficient translation of the viral mRNA to achieve expression of viral genes3.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Schubert, K.; Karousis, E.

350,Unique transcriptional changes in coagulation cascade genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells: A potential factor in COVID-19 coagulopathies,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

What did the researchers do and find?O_LIWe analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.

351,A Fluorescence-based High Throughput-Screening assay for the SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in 2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world. To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

352,The evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within the coronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus,"SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are not phylogenetically closely related; however, both use the ACE2 receptor in humans for cell entry. This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Further, we report three novel sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2. Here, we show that recombination is most likely responsible for the observed patterns of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious, show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario, and propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have been evolutionarily advantageous. The findings from this study provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses. This study also underscores the need for increased surveillance for sarbecoviruses in southwestern China, where ACE2-using viruses have been found to date, as well as other regions including Africa, where these viruses have only recently been discovered.","Wells, H.

Improving our understanding of these presenting symptoms may facilitate the prompt recognition of the disease in emergency departments and prevent further transmission. Methods: We examined a cross-sectional cohort using New York City emergency department syndromic surveillance data for March and April 2020. Emergency department visits for anosmia and/or dysgeusia were identified and subsequently matched to the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System to determine testing results for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 683 patients with anosmia and/or dysgeusia included, SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for 232 (34%) and 168 (72%) were found to be positive. Median age of all patients presenting with anosmia and/or dysgeusia symptoms was 38, and 54% were female. Anosmia and/or dysgeusia was the sole complaint of 158 (23%) patients, of whom 35 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 23 (66%) were positive. While the remaining patients presented with at least one other symptom, nearly half of all patients (n=334, 49%) and more than a third of those who tested positive (n=62, 37%) did not have any of the CDC-established symptoms used for screening of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Conclusions and Relevance: Anosmia and/or dysgeusia have been frequent complaints among patients presenting to emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, while only a small proportion of patients ultimately underwent testing for SARS-CoV-19, the majority of patients tested have been positive. Anosmia and dysgeusia likely represent underrecognized symptoms of COVID-19 but may have important future implications in disease diagnosis and surveillance.","Wang, T.

Design: Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal follow-up if consent given. Setting: England. Participants: 34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households. Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Main outcome measures: Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk factors. Results: The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05% to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45), and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital).

Conclusion: The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other relaxations of control measures.","Pouwels, K.

355,Reopening universities during the COVID-19 pandemic: A testing strategy to minimize active cases and delay outbreaks,"Background: University campuses present an ideal environment for viral spread and are therefore at extreme risk of serving as a hotbed for a COVID-19 outbreak. While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","Rennert, L.; Kalbaugh, C.

356,Multi-Omics integration analysis of respiratory specimen characterizes baseline molecular determinants associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Abstract: Rapid diagnosis and precise prognostication of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a major challenge. A multi-omic approach was adopted, and in the discovery phase, global proteome/metaproteome/metabolome were analysed in the respiratory specimens of SARS-CoV-2 positive [n=20], negative [n=20], and H1N1 positive [n=5] cases. We identified MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1) and WARS (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase) as clues to viral diagnosis and validated in 200 SARS-CoV-2 suspects. MX1 >30pg/ml and WARS >25ng/ml segregated virus positives patients [(AUC=94%CI(0.91-0.97)]. Distinct increase in SARS-CoV-2 induced immune activation, metabolic reprograming and a decrease in oxygen transport, wound healing, fluid regulation, vitamin and steroid metabolism was seen (p<0.05). Multi-omics profiling correlated with viraemia and segregated asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the multiomics approach identified increased respiratory pathogens [Burkholderiales, Klebsiella pneumonia] and decreased lactobacillus salivarius (FDR<0.05, p<0.05) in COVID-19 specimens. Conclusion: Novel proteins [MX1 and WARS] can rapidly and reliably diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify asymptomatic and mild disease.","Maras, J. S.; Sharma, S.; Bhat, A.

357,Molecular tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy in the first three months of the epidemic,"The aim of this study is the characterization and genomic tracing by phylogenetic analyses of 59 new SARS-CoV-2 Italian isolates obtained from patients attending clinical centres in North and Central Italy until the end of April 2020. All but one of the newly characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Lai, A.; Bergna, A.; Caucci, S.; Clementi, N.; Vicenti, I.; Dragoni, F.; Cattelan, A.

358,COVID-19 incidence trends between April and June 2020: A global analysis,"The study sought to investigate how the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have evolved in the most recent three months across the world, and what insights the trends may provide about the second half of the pandemic's first year using a situation analysis approach based on national income, temperature, trade intensity with China, and location defined by longitude and latitude. The study confirmed the negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and temperature. It contributed to the resolution of the conflicting results about latitude after organizing it into a categorical variable instead of its continuous form. This approach works because the average temperature in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region remains similar to the average temperatures in both the Above 15 degrees N region and the Below 15 degrees S region during their summer months because the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region does not experience the marked seasonal changes in temperature. Given the negative association between temperature and case numbers, this suggests that countries in the 15 degrees S to 15 degrees N region might continue exhibiting the low numbers they have thus far exhibited through the second half of this year, even as numbers climb in the Below 15 degrees S region. To succeed, their policymakers must control importation of the disease by implementing effective testing, quarantining, and contact tracing for people entering their borders. Policymakers in countries Below 15 degrees S region may manage their inherent risks by applying lessons learned from countries in the Above 15 degrees N region during these past months. Such preventative measures may allow the world to avoid the drastic lockdown policies and facilitate rapid global economic recovery from this pandemic.","Amanor-Boadu, V.; Ross, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148007v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20148007v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
359,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and COVID-19 infection or hospitalization: a cohort study,"There are plausible mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection or affect disease severity. To examine the association between these medications and COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, we conducted a retrospective cohort study within a US integrated healthcare system. Among people aged [&ge;]18 years enrolled in the health plan for at least 4 months as of 2/29/2020, current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications. COVID-19 infections were identified through 6/14/2020 from laboratory and hospitalization data. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. Among 322,044 individuals, 720 developed COVID-19 infection. Among people using ACEI/ARBs, 183/56,105 developed COVID-19 (3.3 per 1000 individuals) compared with 537/265,939 without ACEI/ARB use (2.0 per 1000), yielding an adjusted OR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.75-1.16).

Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[&ge;]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[&ge;]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.","Xie, Y.; Chen, S.; Wang, X.; Li, B.; Zhang, T.; He, X.; Sun, N.; Wang, L.; Zeng, H.; Shen, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147256v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147256v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
362,WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework Version 1.0: Criteria and considerations to guide evidence-informed decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions targeting COVID-19,"Background: Decision-making on matters of public health requires the balancing of numerous, often conflicting factors. One approach to ensure relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria underpinning the decision is a broad societal discourse and participatory decision-making process. However, this often was not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, evidence-to-decision frameworks can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered, even if not all voices of affected stakeholders could be heard in the process. Objective: The objective of this research project was to develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges decision-makers face when deliberating on national and sub-national level on non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to address the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In phase I, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies. In phase II, we used the best-fit framework synthesis technique with the output of phase I serving as a priori framework. We conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide the policy makers on the phasing out of the lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous versions into the WHO-INTEGRATE COVID framework (WICID framework) Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, which are expanded on through 49 aspects contained within them, and the metacriterion quality of evidence. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental rights, acceptability considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion: In a third phase, the framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework V1.0 can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.","Stratil, J.

363,COVID-19 screening strategies that permit the safe re-opening of college campuses,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges: either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define SARS-CoV-2 screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to campus for the Fall 2020 semester. Design: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate campus screening using tests of varying frequency (daily-weekly), sensitivity (70%-99%), specificity (98%-99.7%), and cost ($10-$50/test). Reproductive numbers Rt = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5} defined three epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. We generally adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of 5000 college-age, uninfected students. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. All measured over an 80-day, abbreviated semester. Results: With Rt = 2.5, daily screening with a 70% sensitive, 98% specific test produces 85 cumulative student infections and isolation dormitory daily census averaging 108 (88% false positives). Screening every 2 (7) days nets 135 (3662) cumulative infections and daily isolation census 66 (252) with 73% (4%) false positives. Across all scenarios, test frequency exerts more influence on outcomes than test sensitivity. Cost-effectiveness analysis selects screening every {2, 1, 7} days with a 70% sensitive test as the preferred strategy for Rt = {2.5, 3.5, 1.5}, implying a screening cost of {$470, $920, $120} per student per semester. Conclusions & Relevance: Rapid, inexpensive and frequently conducted screening (even if only 70% sensitive) would be cost-effective and produce a modest number of COVID-19 infections. While the optimal screening frequency hinges on the success of behavioral interventions to reduce the base severity of transmission (Rt), this could permit the safe return of student to campus.","Paltiel, A.

364,Are men dying more than women by COVID-19?,"We aimed to clarify if the infection and death rate by COVID-19 differ among gender in the top 50 countries with the highest death rates. Also, we investigated if secondary variables such as HDI, number of hospital beds, average age, temperature, percentage of elderly, smoker and obesity are contributing to the variability observed among countries. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions approaches were applied to official public data reported by the Word Health Organization and governments until May, 2020. A random effect model was used for the meta-analysis and heterogeneity was calculated by I2 statistic. There was not significative difference between men and women to be infected by COVID-19 (P = 0.42), though a significative difference was observed for death rate (P < 0.0001). High heterogeneity was observed among countries. For both infection and death rates this variability was mainly explained by the HDI (42.3% and 54.2%), average age (40.9% and 40.3%) and temperature (30.1% and 39.3%). Man are dying more than women around the word by COVID-19. Countries with highest HDI present less difference between sexes.

366,Does sub-Saharan Africa truly defy the forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic? Response from population data,"Introduction. Since its identification, the COVID-19 infection has caused substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide, but sub-Saharan Africa seems to defy the predictions. We aimed to verify this hypothesis using strong statistical methods. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the projected and actual numbers as well as population proportions of COVID-19 cases in the 46 sub-Saharan African countries on May 1st, May 29th (4 weeks later) and June 26th (8 weeks later). The source of the projected number of cases was a publication by scientists from the Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, whereas the actual number of cases was obtained from the WHO situation reports. We calculated the percentage difference between the projected and actual numbers of cases per country. Further, N-1 chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the projected and actual population proportion of COVID-19 cases, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference between these population proportions. All statistical tests were 2-sided, with 0.05 used as threshold for statistical significance. Results. On May 1st, May 29th and June 26th, respectively 40 (86.95%), 45 (97.82%) and 41 (89.13%) of the sub-Saharan African countries reported a number of confirmed cases that was lower than the predicted number of 1000 cases for May 1st and 10000 for both May 29th and June 26th. At these dates, the population proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases were significantly lower (p-value <0.05) than the projected proportions of cases. Across all these dates, South-Africa always exceeded the predicted number and population proportion of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion. Sub-Saharan African countries did defy the dire predictions of the COVID-19 burden. Preventive measures should be further enforced to preserve this positive outcome.","Christophe Dongmo, F.

367,A topic analysis of traditional and social media news coverage of the early COVID-19 pandemic and implications for public health communication,"Knowledge gaps may initially exist among scientists, medical and public health professionals during pandemics, which are fertile grounds for misinformation in news media. We characterized and compared COVID-19 coverage in newspapers, television, and social media, and discussed implications for public health communication strategies that are relevant to an initial pandemic response. We conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modelling technique, analysis of 3,271 newspaper articles, 40 cable news shows transcripts, 96,000 Twitter posts, and 1,000 Reddit posts during March 4 - 12, 2020, a period chronologically early in the timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage of COVID-19 clustered on topics such as epidemic, politics, and the economy, and these varied across media sources. Topics dominating news were not predominantly health-related, suggesting a limited presence of public health in news coverage in traditional and social media. Examples of misinformation were identified particularly in social media. Public health entities should utilize communication specialists to create engaging informational content to be shared on social media sites. Public health officials should be attuned to their target audience to anticipate and prevent spread of common myths likely to exist within a population.

368,Early Detection Of COVID-19 Using A Smartwatch,"Wearable devices digitally measuring vital signs have been used for monitoring health and illness onset and have high potential for real-time monitoring and disease detection. As such they are potentially useful during public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Using smartwatch data from 31 infected individuals identified from a cohort of over 5000 participants, we investigated the use of wearables for early, presymptomatic detection of COVID-19. From physiological and activity data, we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases. Failure to detect these changes in the remaining patients often occurred in those with chronic respiratory/lung disease. Importantly the physiological alterations were detected prior to, or at, symptom onset in over 85% of the positive cases (21/24), in some cases nine or more days before symptoms. Through daily surveys we can track physiological changes with symptom onset and severity. Finally, we develop a method to detect onset of COVID-19 infection in real-time which detects 67% of infection cases at or before symptom onset. Our study provides a roadmap to a rapid and universal diagnostic method for the large-scale detection of respiratory viral infections in advance of symptoms, highlighting a useful approach for managing epidemics using digital tracking and health monitoring.","Mishra, T.; Wang, M.; Metwally, A.

369,Passive Monitoring of Physiological Data and Self-reported Symptoms to Detect Clusters of People with COVID-19,"Traditional screening for COVID-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms, travel history, and sometimes temperature measurements. We explored whether longitudinal, personal sensor data can help identify subtle changes which may indicate an infection, such as COVID-19. To do this we developed an app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results from participants living in the US. We assessed whether symptoms and sensor data could differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. Between March 25 and June 7, 2020, we enrolled 30,529 participants, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms, 54 reported testing positive for COVID-19, and 279 negative. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an AUC=0.80 [0.73 - 0.86] which was significantly better (p < 0.01) than a model which just considered symptoms alone (AUC=0.71 [0.63 - 0.79]) in the discrimination between symptomatic individuals positive or negative for COVID-19. Such orthogonal, continuous, passively captured data may be complementary to virus testing that is generally a one-off, or infrequent, sampling assay.","Quer, G.; Radin, J.

370,The usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 test positive proportion as a surveillance tool,"Comparison of COVID-19 case numbers over time and between locations is complicated by limits to virologic testing confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to under-reporting of incidence, and by variations in testing capacity between locations and over time. The proportion of tested individuals who have tested positive (test positive proportion, TPP) can potentially be used to qualitatively assess the testing capacity of a location; a high TPP could provide evidence that too few people are tested, leading to more under-reporting. In this study we propose a simple model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters in the model, related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. We use simulations to show situations in which the TPP is higher or lower than we expect based on these parameters, and the effect of testing strategies on the TPP. In our simulations, we find in the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between spatial locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. As a corollary, the TPP can be used to distinguish between a decline in confirmed cases due to decline in incidence (in which case TPP should decline) and a decline in confirmed cases due to testing constraints (in which case TPP should remain constant). We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms (test symptomatic proportion, TSP) encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average. We suggest that collection of symptom status and age/risk category of tested individuals can aid interpretation of changes in TPP and increase the utility of TPP in assessing the state of the pandemic in different locations and times.","Hitchings, M.

372,Chest X-Ray Has Poor Diagnostic Accuracy and Prognostic Significance in COVID-19: A Propensity Matched Database Study,"Objectives: To identify the diagnostic accuracy of common imaging modalities, chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the general emergency population in the UK and to find the association between imaging features and outcomes in these patients. Design: Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records Setting: Tertiary academic health science centre and designated centre for high consequence infectious diseases in London, UK. Participants: 1,198 patients who attended the emergency department with paired RT-PCR swabs for SARS-CoV 2 and CXR between 16th March and 16th April 2020 Main outcome measures: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR and CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 using the British Society of Thoracic Imaging reporting templates. Reference standard was any reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive naso-oropharyngeal swab within 30 days of attendance. Odds ratios of CXR in association with vital signs, laboratory values and 30-day outcomes were calculated. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of CXR for COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. For CT scans these were 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.90) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.41-0.60), respectively. This gave a statistically significant mean increase in sensitivity with CT compared with CXR, of 29% (95% CI 19%-38%, p<0.0001). Specificity was not significantly different between the two modalities. Chest X-ray findings were not statistically significantly or clinical meaningfully associated with vital signs, laboratory parameters or 30-day outcomes. Conclusions: Computed tomography has substantially improved diagnostic performance over CXR in COVID-19. CT should be strongly considered in the initial assessment for suspected COVID-19. This gives potential for increased sensitivity and considerably faster turnaround time, where capacity allows and balanced against excess radiation exposure risk.","Borakati, A.; Perera, A.; Johnson, J.; Sood, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147934v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147934v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True

374,Impact of Congestive Heart Failure and Role of Cardiac Biomarkers in COVID-19 patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to cause worse outcomes in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, especially in patients with acute cardiac injury, which is determined by elevated levels of high-sensitivity troponin. There is a paucity of data on the impact of congestive heart failure (CHF) on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from 11/1/2019 till 06/07/2020, and identified all relevant studies reporting cardiovascular comorbidities, cardiac biomarkers, disease severity, and survival. Pooled data from the selected studies were used for metanalysis to identify the impact of risk factors and cardiac biomarker elevation on disease severity and/or mortality. Results: We collected pooled data on 5,967 COVID-19 patients from 20 individual studies. We found that both non-survivors and those with severe disease had an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac arrhythmias, our pooled relative risk (RR) was - 8.52 (95% CI 3.63-19.98) (p<0.001); and 3.61 (95% CI 2.03-6.43) (p=0.001), respectively.

375,Projections and early-warning signals of a second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois,"We present two different scenarios for a second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois and simulate them using our previously described age-of-infection model, calibrated to real-time hospital and deaths data. In the first scenario we assume that the parameters of the second wave in Illinois would be similar to those currently observed in other states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. We estimate doubling times of hospitalizations and test positivity in all states with relevant publicly available data and calculate the corresponding effective reproduction numbers for Illinois. These parameters are remarkably consistent in states with rapidly growing epidemics. We conjecture that the emergence of the second wave of the epidemic in these states can be attributed to superspreading events at large parties, crowded bars, and indoor dining. In our second, more optimistic scenario we assume changes in Illinois state policy would result in successful mitigation of superspreading events and thus would lower the effective reproduction number to the value observed in late June 2020. In this case our calculations show effective suppression of the second wave in Illinois. Our analysis also suggests that the logarithmic time derivatives of COVID-19 hospitalizations and case positivity can serve as a simple but strong early-warning signal of the onset of a second wave.","Weiner, Z.; Wong, G.; Elbanna, A.; Tkachenko, A.; Maslov, S.; Goldenfeld, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147868v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147868v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
376,Causally Associations of Blood Lipids Levels with COVID-19 Risk: Mendelian Randomization Study,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). It has been found that coronary artery disease (CAD) is a comorbid condition for COVID-19. As the risk factors of CAD, whether blood lipids levels are causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 is still unknown. Design: We performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to explore whether dyslipidemia, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) were causally related to COVID-19 risk and severity. The GWAS summary data of blood lipids involving in 188,578 individuals and dyslipidemia in a total of 53,991 individuals were used as exposures, respectively. Two COVID-19 GWASs including 1,221 infected patients and 1,610 severe patients defined as respiratory failure were employed as outcomes. Based on the MR estimates, we further carried out gene-based and gene-set analysis to explain the potential mechanism for causal effect. Results: The MR results showed that dyslipidemia was casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19 and induced 27% higher odds for COVID-19 infection (MR-IVW OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.49, p-value = 3.18 x 10-3). Moreover, the increasing level of blood TC will raise 14 % higher odds for the susceptibility of COVID-19 (MR-IVW OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.25, p-value = 5.07 x 10-3). Gene-based analysis identified that ABO gene was associated with TC and the gene-set analysis found that immune processes were involved in the risk effect of TC. Conclusions: We obtained three conclusions: 1) Dyslipidemia is casually associated with the susceptibility of COVID-19; 2) TC is a risk factor for the susceptibility of COVID-19; 3) The different susceptibility of COVID-19 in specific blood group may be partly explained by the TC concentration in diverse ABO blood groups.","Zhang, K.; Guo, Y.; Wang, Z.-X.; Ding, J.-M.; Yao, S.; Chen, H.; Zhu, D.-L.; Zhang, K.; Huang, W.; Dong, S.-S.; Yang, T.-L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147926v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.20147926v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
377,Modelling interventions to control COVID-19 outbreaks in a refugee camp,"Refugee camp populations are expected to be vulnerable to COVID-19 due to overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate medical facilities. Because there has been no COVID-19 outbreak in a refugee camp to date, the potential for nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in refugee camps remains untested. We used an agent-based model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks in the Moria refugee camp, and we studied the effects of feasible interventions. Subdividing the camp ('sectoring') ""flattened the curve,"" reducing peak infection by up to 70% and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly to be effective. Lockdowns had little effect on COVID-19 dynamics. Our findings provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies against COVID-19 or future epidemics.","Gilman, R. T.; Mahroof-Shaffi, S.; Harkensee, C.; Chamberlain, A.

378,Examining the protection efficacy of face shields against cough aerosol droplets using water sensitive papers,"Simple plastic face shields have many advantages compared to regular medical masks. They are easily cleaned for reuse and comfortable to wear. In light of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the potential of face shields as a substitution for medical masks, as a recommendation to the general population, was tested. Testing the efficacy of the protective equipment utilized a cough simulator that was carefully tuned to replicate human cough in terms of droplet size distribution and outlet velocity. The tested protective equipment was worn on a manikin head simulating human breathing. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) was used to analyze the concentration and size distribution of small particles that reach the manikin head respiration pathways. Additionally, Water sensitive papers were taped over and under the tested protective equipment, and were subsequently photographed and analyzed. For droplets larger than 3m by diameter, the efficiency of shields to block cough droplets was found to be comparable to that of regular medical masks, with enhanced protection on face parts the mask does not cover. Additionally, for finer particles, of the order 0.3 to few microns, a shield was found to perform even better, blocking about 10 times more fine particles than the medical mask. This implies that for the general population that is not intendedly exposed to confirmed infected individuals, recommending the use of face shields as an alternative to medical masks should be considered.","Ronen, A.; Rotter, H.; Elisha, S.; Sevilia, S.; Parizer, B.; Hafif, N.; Manor, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147090v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147090v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
379,Could masks curtail the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19 in the US?,"The community lockdown measures implemented in the United States from late March to late May of 2020 resulted in a significant reduction in the community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are greatly augmented if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. It is shown that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the level of lifting of lockdown was mild (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. Our study further shows that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.","Ngonghala, C.

380,Predicted effects of summer holidays and seasonality on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in France,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France has had a large death toll. It has not affected all regions similarly, since the death rate can vary several folds between regions where the epidemic has remained at a low level and regions where it got an early burst. The epidemic has been slowed down by a lockdown that lasted for almost eight weeks, and individuals can now move between metropolitan French regions without restriction. In this report we investigate the effect on the epidemic of summer holidays, during which millions of individuals will move between French regions. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of strong or weak seasonality and of several values for the reproduction number on the epidemic, in particular on the timing, the height and the spread of a second wave. To do so, we extend a SEIR model to simulate the effect of summer migrations between regions on the number and distribution of new infections. We find that the model predicts little effect of summer migrations on the epidemic. However, all the reproduction numbers above 1.0 and the seasonality parameters we tried result in a second epidemic wave, with a peak date that can vary between October 2020 and April 2021. If the sanitary measures currently in place manage to keep the reproduction number below 1.0, the second wave will be avoided. If they keep the reproduction number at a low value, for instance at 1.1 as in one of our simulations, the second wave is flattened and could be similar to the first wave.","Duchemin, L.; Veber, P.; Paris, M.; Boussau, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147660v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
381,Change points in the spread of COVID-19 question the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany,"Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown"" (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","Wieland, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146837v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.20146837v1?rss=1,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,,True
382,Conserved Genomic Terminals of SARS-CoV-2 as Co-evolving Functional Elements and Potential Therapeutic Targets,"ABSTRACTTo identify features in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3’-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on predicted, yet extensive, complementary base-pairings and similar interactions involving the Influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3’-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chan, A.

383,Animal Model Prescreening: Pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 impacts responses in the NHP model,"COVID-19 presents herculean challenges to research and scientific communities for producing diagnostic and treatment solutions. Any return to normalcy requires rapid development of countermeasures, with animal models serving as a critical tool in testing vaccines and therapeutics. Animal disease status and potential COVID-19 exposure prior to study execution may severely bias efficacy testing. We developed a toolbox of immunological and molecular tests to monitor countermeasure impact on disease outcome and evaluate pre-challenge COVID-19 status. Assay application showed critical necessity for animal pre-screening. Specifically, real-time PCR results documented pre-exposure of an African Green Monkey prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge with sequence confirmation as a community-acquired exposure. Longitudinal monitoring of nasopharyngeal swabs and serum showed pre-exposure impacted both viral disease course and resulting immunological response. This study demonstrates utility in a comprehensive pre-screening strategy for animal models, which captured the first documented case of community-acquired, non-human primate infection.

384,Discovery of Drug-like Ligands for the Mac1 Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3,"ABSTRACTThe Mac1 domain of the multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) is a potential COVID-19 drug target because it is suspected to enhance the ability of the virus to evade the human immune system. The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain binds ADP-ribose and proteins harboring this important post-translational modification. Small molecules that bind the Mac1 domain in place of ADP-ribose might therefore be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for antiviral drug discovery. Two high throughput screens were used here to identify such ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds. The first screen used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, aka the thermal shift or ThermoFluor assay) to examine the melting temperature of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain in the presence of various compounds. In the second screen, various high-resolution SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 structures were used with Autodock VINA to identify potential ligands. Numerous hit compounds were either steroids (estradiol valerate &amp; flunisolide), beta-lactams (cefaclor &amp; cefatrizine), or benzimidazoles (telmisartan, rabeprazole, omeprazole, &amp; esomeprazole). Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to confirm that rabeprazole, omeprazole, and compounds in other chemical classes, such as irinotecan, nifedipine, trifluoperazine, bind SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 with an affinity similar to ADP-ribose.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Virdi, R.

385,Identification of potent and safe antiviral therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2,"COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of &gt;600, indicating wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xiao, X.; Wang, C.; Chang, D.; Wang, Y.; Dong, X.; Jiao, T.; Zhao, Z.; Ren, L.; Dela Cruz, C.

386,N and O glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage sites that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. We observe that the spike protein is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and we confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed LC-MS/MS methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motifs on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein’s glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of the O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sanda, M.; Morrison, L.; Goldman, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.05.187344v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
387,Comparison of Transgenic and Adenovirus hACE2 Mouse Models for SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Development of animal models that recapitulate important aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for the evaluation of vaccines and antivirals, and understanding disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-1, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(1-3). Due to amino acid differences between murine and hACE2, inbred mouse strains fail to support high titer viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, a number of transgenic and knock-in mouse models, as well as viral vector-mediated hACE2 delivery systems have been developed. Here we compared the K18-hACE2 transgenic model to adenovirus-mediated delivery of hACE2 to the mouse lung. We show that K18-hACE2 mice replicate virus to high titers in both the lung and brain leading to lethality. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated delivery results in viral replication to lower titers limited to the lung, and no clinical signs of infection with a challenge dose of 104 plaque forming units. The K18-hACE2 model provides a stringent model for testing the ability of vaccines and antivirals to protect against disease, whereas the adenovirus delivery system has the flexibility to be used across multiple genetic backgrounds and modified mouse strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Rathnasinghe, R.; Strohmeier, S.; Amanat, F.; Gillespie, V.

388,Gene Expression Network Analysis Provides Potential Targets Against SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTBACKGROUND Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological functions and potential as druggable targets.METHODS Using the gene expression profiles of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified known drug-gene interactions.RESULTS ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 12 genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r&gt;0.3, FDR&lt;0.05) had known interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 co-expressed genes; 15 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology biologic process ‘Entry into host cell’, and 53 TMPRSS2-correlated genes had known interactions with drug compounds.CONCLUSION Dozens of genes are co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially targetable with existing drugs, which may help to fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementS.M. reports personal fees from Novartis and Boehringer-Ingelheim, outside the submitted work.

389,SARS-CoV-2 contributes to altering the post-transcriptional regulatory networks across human tissues by sponging RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide public health emergency. Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 mediated alteration on post-transcriptional gene regulation across human tissues remains elusive. In this study, we systematically dissected the crosstalk and dysregulation of human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins directly interact with 51 human RBPs of which majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock treated versus SARS-CoV-2 infected lung cells that revealed an enrichment for immune response, cytokine mediated signaling, and metabolism associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells compared to control demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to viral infection. Motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed an enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs and HNRNPs illustrating the sponging of RBPs by SARS-CoV-2 genome. Similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed the potential for several miRs to be sponged, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to altered pos-transcriptional regulation across human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key pos-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provides a systematic analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs, across tissues types during SARS-CoV2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Srivastava, R.; Daulatabad, S.

390,Mutational signatures and heterogeneous host response revealed via large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity,"AbstractTo dissect the mechanisms underlying the observed inflation of variants in SARS-CoV-2 genome, we present the largest up-to-date analysis of intra-host genomic diversity, which reveals that the majority of samples present a complex sublineage architecture, due to the interplay between host-related mutational processes and transmission dynamics.Strikingly, the deconvolution of the entire set of intra-host variants reveals the existence of mutually exclusive viral mutational signatures, which prove that distinct hosts differently respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In particular, two signatures are likely ruled by APOBEC and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which induce hypermutation in a significant number of samples, and appear to be affected by severe purifying selection.Conversely, several mutations linked to low-rate mutational processes appear to transit to clonality in the population, eventually leading to the definition of new viral genotypes and to an increase of overall genomic diversity. Finally, we demonstrate that a high number of variants are observed in samples associated to independent lineages, likely due to signature-related mutational hotspots or to positive selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Graudenzi, A.; Maspero, D.; Angaroni, F.; Piazza, R.; Ramazzotti, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.189944v1?rss=1,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,,False
391,Renal carcinoma is associated with increased risk of coronavirus infections,"The current pandemic COVID-19 has affected most severely to the people with old age, or with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, COPD, and cancers. Cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the disease because of the malignancy or treatment-related immunosuppression; hence identification of the vulnerable population among these patients is essential. It is speculated that along with ACE2, other auxiliary proteins (DPP4, ANPEP, ENPEP, TMPRSS2) might facilitate the entry of coronaviruses in the host cells. We took a bioinformatics approach to analyze the gene and protein expression data of these coronavirus receptors in human normal and cancer tissues of multiple organs. Here, we demonstrated an extensive RNA and protein expression profiling analysis of these receptors across solid tumors and normal tissues. We found that among all, renal tumor and normal tissues exhibited increased levels of ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP, and ENPEP. Our results revealed that TMPRSS2 may not be the co-receptor for coronavirus in renal carcinoma patients. The receptors’ expression levels were variable in different tumor stage, molecular and immune subtypes of renal carcinoma. In clear cell renal cell carcinomas, coronavirus receptors were associated with high immune infiltration, markers of immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion. Our study indicates that CoV receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma. As our current knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms will improve, it may help us in designing focused therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tripathi, S.

392,Comparison of three TaqMan Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2,"Quick and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for COVID-19 control. Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LOD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LOD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively).

393,Snapshot of the evolution and mutation patterns of SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history. Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhao, J.; zhai, x.; Zhou, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.04.187435v1?rss=1,2020-07-05,2020-07-05,,False
394,A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike,"SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global pathogen1,2, sparking urgent vaccine development efforts with the trimeric spike3,4. However, the inability of antibodies like CR30225, which binds a cryptic spike epitope with nanomolar affinity6, to neutralize virus, suggests a spike-based means of neutralization escape. Here, we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have 10% the unfolding enthalpy of a globular protein at physiological pH, where it is recognized by antibodies like CR3022, and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where it sheds such antibodies, suggesting that the spike evades potentially neutralizing antibody through a pH-dependent mechanism of conformational masking. To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH. In the absence of ACE2, cryo-EM analyses indicated lower pH to reduce conformational heterogeneity. Single-receptor binding domain (RBD)-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH through lowering of RBD and refolding of a pH-dependent switch. Notably, the emerging Asp614Gly strain7 partially destabilizes the switch that locks RBD down, thereby enhancing functional interactions with ACE2 while reducing evasion by conformational masking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Zhou, T.; Tsybovsky, Y.; Olia, A.

They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV.

396,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant D614G increases infectivity and retains sensitivity to antibodies that target the receptor binding domain,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus worldwide in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of various mammalian ACE2 orthologs. Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.","Yurkovetskiy, L.; Pascal, K.

The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR.

400,Map of SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes not shielded by glycans.,"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, calls for the urgent development of a vaccine. The primary immunological target is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface to mediate viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites not shielded by glycans, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for vaccine development. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics in epitope mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sikora, M.; von Bülow, S.; Blanc, F.

401,A CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay that is robust against viral evolution and RNA editing,"Extensive testing is essential to break the transmission of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostics have emerged as attractive alternatives to quantitative real-time PCR due to their faster turnaround time and their potential to be used in point-of-care testing scenarios. However, existing CRISPR-based assays for COVID-19 have not considered viral genome mutations and RNA editing in human cells. Here, we present the VaNGuard (Variant Nucleotide Guard) test that is not only specific and sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, but can also detect the virus when its genome or transcriptome has evolved or has been edited by deaminases in infected human cells. We show that an engineered AsCas12a enzyme is more tolerant of mismatches than wildtype LbCas12a and that multiplexed Cas12a targeting can overcome the presence of single nucleotide variations. Our assay can be completed in 30 minutes with a dipstick for a rapid point-of-care test.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Ooi, K.

Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 clades that have spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Sapoval, N.; Mahmoud, M.; Jochum, M.

404,Using iCn3D and the World Wide Web for structure-based collaborative research: Analyzing molecular interactions at the root of COVID-19,"ABSTRACTThe COVID-19 pandemic took us ill-prepared and tackling the many challenges it poses in a timely manner requires world-wide collaboration. Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced “I see in 3D”) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging “lifelong” web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of “sharing of molecular scenes” in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Youkharibache, P.; Cachau, R.

405,Early postmortem mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients with COVID-19 and correlation to tissue damage,"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 is a systemic disease. An investigation of the viral distribution within the human body in correlation to tissue damage can help understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.We present a detailed mapping of viral RNA in 61 tissues and organs of 11 deceased patients with the diagnosis COVID-19. The autopsies were performed within the (very) early postmortem interval (mean: 5.6 hours) to avoid bias due to viral RNA and tissue degradation. Viral loads, blood levels of cytokines, prothrombotic factors as well as macro- and micro-morphology were correlated.Very high (&gt; 104 copies/ml) viral loads were detected in the lungs of most patients and then correlated to severe tissue damage. Intact viral particles could be verified in the lung tissue by transmission electron microscopy. Viral loads in the lymph nodes were associated with a loss of follicular architecture. Viral RNA was detected throughout further extra-pulmonary tissues and organs without visible tissue damage. Inflammatory cytokines as well as the prothrombotic factors were elevated in all patients.In conclusion, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2-RNA throughout the body supports the hypothesis of a maladaptive host response with viremia and multi-organ dysfunction.View Full Text","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Wittschieber, D.; Sanft, J.; Kleemann, S.; Elschner, S.; Haupt, K.

407,Association between neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and commercial serological assays,"Introduction Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Tang, M.

In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies.

410,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for large amounts of diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA, which commercial suppliers are increasingly unable to deliver. In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","Kalnina, L.; Mateu-Regue, A.; Oerum, S.; Hald, A.; Gerstoft, J.; Oerum, H.; Cilius Nielsen, F.; Iversen, A.

411,SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals are likely expanded by beta-coronaviruses,"The current pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and large progress in understanding the pathology of the virus has been made since its emergence in late 2019. Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals.

412,Multicenter comparison of the Cobas 6800 system with the RealStar RT-PCR kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundRT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).

MethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).

ResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

ConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","Chaix, M.-L.; Wirden, M.; Feghoul, L.; Bertine, M.; Nere, M.-L.; Le Hingrat, Q.; Abdi, B.; Boutolleau, D.; Ferre, V.

413,Assessment of Proton-Coupled Conformational Dynamics of SARS and MERS Coronavirus Papain-like Proteases: Implication for Designing Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Inhibitors,"Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future ones. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine.

We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Sheffield, UK. Using a simple local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sub-genomic RNA. We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis. Finally variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sub-genomic RNAs with high fidelity in most cases.

As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction.

Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides “RIRGGDGKMKDL” and “AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG” were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Chukwudozie, O.

417,Genetic architecture of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2,"Strategies to develop therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be informed by experimental identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid  in silico assessment in human genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response.

418,If the link missed：Could inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increase the risk of COVID-19?,"Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emerged globally. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is crucial for SARS-COV-2 entering into the cells. The expression of ACE2 in skin suggested that skin might be a way of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. We found the elevated ACE2 level of patients with psoriasis but downregulated after IL-17 antibody treatment. Further results showed that ACE2 expression increased either in psoriasis or in atopic dermatitis, which were typical inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction. And elevated ACE2 level was also detected in mouse models of dermatitis induced by imiquimod, calcipotriol, repeated tape-stripping or 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) respectively. Moreover, alleviation of cutaneous inflammation with skin recovery moisture also lowered expression of ACE2 in mouse models with barrier deteriorated inflammatory skin disorders. Furthermore, inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increased the penetration of topical FITC conjugated spike protein into the skin. Conversely, improvement in skin permeability barrier could prevent this penetration. Thus, indicating the special link between inflammatory skin disorders with skin barrier dysfunction and increasing risk of COVID-19.","Xu, Q.; Chen, L.; Zhang, L.; Li, X.; Zheng, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181297v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False
419,High affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged to a global pandemic and caused significant damages to public health. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lu, J.; Sun, P.

420,Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from North Africa: viral origins and mutational spectrum,"In Morocco two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded. The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections.

At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources.

Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries. These results have the potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological information and the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.","Laamarti, M.; Kartti, S.; Alouane, T.; Laamarti, R.; Allam, L.; Ouadghiri, M.; Chemao-Elfihri, M.

421,Early data on the performance of a combined SARS-CoV-2 spike-nucleocapsid antibody lateral flow device compared to a nucleocapsid-only device,"Background There is a critical need for reliable antibody detection methods in order to study and evaluate the public health and clinical response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices offer the prospect of rapid point-of-care testing (POCT), but the performance of these devices must be evaluated for robustness before they can be adopted for routine clinical and public health use.Methods Plasma and serum specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive (n = 131) and RNA-negative (n = 16) patients were taken from various time points with respect to the onset of symptoms. All 147 anonymised specimens were tested for IgM and IgG using the Hangzhou AllTest 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and the Abbexa COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit.Results IgM sensitivity ranged from 13% to 68%, depending on the date of symptom onset and the device. Regarding IgG, the Abbexa device outperformed the Hangzhou device at all cumulative timeline brackets, with sensitivity of 97·87% (Abbexa) versus 68·09% (Hangzhou) for samples beyond 21 days from symptom onset. Day 21 was therefore chosen as the cut-off for ascertaining test performance characteristics, beyond which the specificity was 100% for both devices and negative predictive value was 0·94 (Abbexa) versus 0·50 (Hangzhou).Discussion Based on this limited dataset, the performance characteristics of the Abbexa LFIA device were substantially better than those of the Hangzhou device. Applying a 21-day cut-off for the Abbexa device meets the minimum (98%) sensitivity and specificity thresholds set by the UK Medicine &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Abbexa device captures antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, as opposed to Hangzhou that targets only the nucleocapsid protein. We therefore propose that spike glycoprotein antibodies be considered as part of the standard diagnostic approach towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling to improve clinical sensitivity and potentially specificity, pending follow-up studies to confirm this approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Linares, C.

422,Next-generation diagnostics: virus capture facilitates a sensitive viral diagnosis for epizootic and zoonotic pathogens including SARS-CoV-2,"BackgroundThe detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.

MethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.

ResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.

ConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","Wylezich, C.; Calvelage, S.; Schlottau, K.; Ziegler, U.; Pohlmann, A.; Hoeper, D.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.181446v1?rss=1,2020-07-01,2020-07-01,,False

Due to lack of specific medicine and vaccine, viral infection has gained a frightening rate and created a devastating state across the globe. Here the authors have attempted to design epitope based potential peptide as a vaccine candidate using immunoinformatics approach. As of evidence from literatures, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is a key protein to initiate the viral infection within a host cell thus used here as a reasonable vaccine target. We have predicted a 9-mer peptide as representative of both B-cell and T-cell epitopic region along with suitable properties such as antigenic and non-allergenic. To its support, strong molecular interaction of the predicted peptide was also observed with MHC molecules and Toll Like receptors. The present study may helpful to step forward in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19.

We find that at low frequencies, the power spectrum presents a small and distinct departure from the behavior expected from an uncorrelated sequence. We provide a couple of simple models to characterize such deviations. Away from a small low-frequency domain, the spectrum presents largely stochastic fluctuations about fixed values and exhibits no other peaks apart from one associated with triplet codon usage. We uncover an interesting, new scaling law for the coronavirus genome: the complexity of the genome scales linearly with the power-law exponent that characterizes the low-frequency domain of the spectral density.","Tan, H.

425,Mutations from bat ACE2 orthologs markedly enhance ACE2-Fc neutralization of SARS-CoV-2,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002-2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc. These data narrow the potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of ACE2-Fc.","Mou, H.; Quinlan, B.; Peng, H.; Guo, Y.; Peng, S.; Zhang, L.; Davis-Gardner, M.; Gardner, M.; Voo, Z.

To address this and other questions, we created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) which comprises 82,924 cells from 19 organs and tissues. This atlas provides a molecular characterization of numerous cell types from a variety of anatomical sites, and we used it to identify clusters of transcription features that define cell types across all of the surveyed organs. Analysis of viral entry receptor genes for known zoonotic viruses showed cell distribution patterns similar to that of humans, with higher expression levels in bat intestine epithelial cells. In terms of the immune system, CD8+ T cells are in high proportion with tissue-resident memory T cells, and long-lived effector memory nature killer (NK) T-like cells (KLRG1, GZMA and ITGA4 genes) are broadly distributed across the organs. Isolated lung primary bat pulmonary fibroblast (BPF) cells were used to evaluate innate immunity, and they showed a weak response to interferon {beta} and tumor necrosis factor- compared to their human counterparts, consistent with our transcriptional analysis.

Here, we assess three recently identified SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Beijing from June 2020 and attempt to determine the origin of these genomes, made available in the GISAID database. The database contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world.

431,A Targeted Vaccine against COVID-19: S1-Fc Vaccine Targeting the Antigen-Presenting Cell Compartment Elicits Protection against SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Vaccination efficacy is enhanced by targeting the antigen-presenting cell compartment. Here, we show that S1-Fc antigen delivery targeting the Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cell compartment elicits anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-antigen specific IgG production in vivo exerting biologically functional and protective activity against live virus infection, assessed in a stringent experimental virus challenge assay in vitro. The S1-domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was genetically fused to a human immunoglobulin Fc moiety, which contributes to mediate S1-Fc cellular internalization by Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells. Immediately upon administration intramuscularly, our novel vaccine candidate recombinant rS1-Fc homes to lymph nodes in vivo where Fc{gamma}R+ antigen-presenting cells reside. Seroconversion is achieved as early as day 7, mounting considerably increased levels of anti-S1 IgGs in vivo.

However, low-dose immunization, safeguarding patient safety, using recombinant rS1-Fc, elicits a considerably elevated protection amplitude against live SARS-CoV-2 infection.

432,SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 elicits immunogenicity in baboons and protection in mice,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the world with an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to effectuate herd immunity to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report the development of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) produced from the full-length spike (S) protein, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Purified NVX-CoV2373 S form 27.2nm nanoparticles that are thermostable and bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In mice and baboons, low-dose NVX-CoV2373 with saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant elicits high titer anti-S IgG that is associated with blockade of hACE2 receptor binding, virus neutralization, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice with no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). NVX-CoV2373 vaccine also elicits multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T follicular helper T cells (Tfh), and the generation of antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in the spleen.

433,Structure of the full SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected cells,"SUMMARYSARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, 30-kilobase RNA genome responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines with proven efficacy, and development of these treatments are hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular and structural biology of the virus. Like many other RNA viruses, RNA structures in coronaviruses regulate gene expression and are crucial for viral replication. Although genome and transcriptome data were recently reported, there is to date little experimental data on predicted RNA structures in SARS-CoV-2 and most putative regulatory sequences are uncharacterized. Here we report the secondary structure of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected cells at single nucleotide resolution using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq). Our results reveal previously undescribed structures within critical regulatory elements such as the genomic transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Contrary to previous studies, our in-cell data show that the structure of the frameshift element, which is a major drug target, is drastically different from prevailing in vitro models. The genomic structure detailed here lays the groundwork for coronavirus RNA biology and will guide the design of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-based therapeutics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Lan, T.

434,A High Content Screen for Mucin-1-Reducing Compounds Identifies Fostamatinib as a Candidate for Rapid Repurposing for Acute Lung Injury during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Drug repurposing is the only method capable of delivering treatments on the shortened time-scale required for patients afflicted with lung disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mucin-1 (MUC1), a membrane-bound molecule expressed on the apical surfaces of most mucosal epithelial cells, is a biochemical marker whose elevated levels predict the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In response to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, we took advantage of a high content screen of 3,713 compounds at different stages of clinical development to identify FDA-approved compounds that reduce MUC1 protein abundance. Our screen identified Fostamatinib (R788), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, as a repurposing candidate for the treatment of ALI. In vivo, Fostamatinib reduced MUC1 abundance in lung epithelial cells in a mouse model of ALI. In vitro, SYK inhibition by Fostamatinib promoted MUC1 removal from the cell surface. Our work reveals Fostamatinib as a repurposing drug candidate for ALI and provides the rationale for rapidly standing up clinical trials to test Fostamatinib efficacy in patients with COVID-19 lung injury.","Malimova, M.; Sidhom, E.-H.; Satyam, A.; Dvela-Levitt, M.; Melanson, M.; Chamberlain, B.

435,Anti-frameshifting ligand active against SARS coronavirus-2 is resistant to natural mutations of the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins. Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress −1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of −1 PRF.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Neupane, K.; Munshi, S.; Zhao, M.; Ritchie, D.

436,SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Human Lung Alveolar Type 2 Cells Elicits a Rapid Epithelial-Intrinsic Inflammatory Response,"ABSTRACTThe most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Huang, J.; Hume, A.

437,"A Fast and Accessible Method for the Isolation of RNA, DNA, and Protein to Facilitate the Detection of SARS-CoV-2","Management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Ponce-Rojas, J.

438,Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-EM,"The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed S-trimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Xu, C.; Wang, Y.; Liu, C.; Zhang, C.; Han, W.; Hong, X.; Wang, Y.; Hong, Q.; Wang, S.; Zhao, Q.; Wang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Chen, K.; Zheng, W.; Kong, L.; Wang, F.; Zuo, Q.; Huang, Z.; Cong, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.177097v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False
439,Validation and Comparison of a Modified CDC Assay with two Commercially Available Assays for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Specimen,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the globe since it was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories in deciding what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDx SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin Simplexa Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primesr/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/ml. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 161 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 24 hours or 5 days from routine testing. A 100% agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time, and highest TAT.","Lima, A.; Healer, V.; Vendrone, E.; Silbert, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179192v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.179192v1?rss=1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,,False

We utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range. Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 (n=7). The colloid retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects (n=6) or human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women (n=2). The optimized method has detection limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

442,Phosphorylation modulates liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein,"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of coronaviruses serves two major functions: compaction of the RNA genome in the virion and regulation of viral gene transcription in the infected cell1–3. The N protein contains two globular RNA-binding domains surrounded by regions of intrinsic disorder4. Phosphorylation of the central disordered region is required for normal viral genome transcription5,6, which occurs in a cytoplasmic structure called the replication transcription complex (RTC)7–11. It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12–15. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing. Inhibitors of N protein phosphorylation could therefore serve as antiviral therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Carlson, C.

The serum IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by using an ELISA-based assay. Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay.

The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 81.08%, 92.86%, 96.77% and 65.00%, respectively when RNA extraction was included in the protocol with saliva, whereas sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 83.78%, 92.86%, 68.42% and 96.88%, respectively, for the heat-inactivation protocol. However, when the analysis was performed exclusively on saliva samples with a limited time from the onset of symptoms (<9 days, N=28), these values were 90%, 87.5%, 44% and 98.75% for the heat-inactivation protocol. The study showed that RT-PCR can be performed using saliva in an RNA extraction free protocol, showing good sensitivity and specificity.","Vila, J.; Fernandez-Pittol, M.; Hurtado, J.

448,Rational Design of the Remdesivir Binding Site in the RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: Implications for Potential Resistance,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving with the continuous emergence of new mutations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Padhi, A.; Shukla, R.; Tripathi, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174896v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
449,Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein in Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and its possible implications in SARS CoV-2 related studies,"Recently, the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been demonstrated as a clinically relevant animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others. We believe that the findings of this study will enable the appropriate use of the Syrian golden hamster to carryout SARS-CoV-2 related studies.","Suresh, V.; Parida, D.; Minz, A.

450,SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and boosts proinflammatory activity,"ABSTRACTThere is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

451,Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. We systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Sekine, T.; Perez-Potti, A.; Rivera-Ballesteros, O.; Straling, K.; Gorin, J.-B.; Olsson, A.; Llewellyn-Lacey, S.; Kamal, H.; Bogdanovic, G.; Muschiol, S.; Wulliman, D.

452,An in vitro assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral preparations of iodine complexes (RENESSANS),"Since the emergence of CoVID-19 pandemic in China in late 2019, scientists are striving hard to explore non-toxic, viable anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds or medicines. We determined In Vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of oral formulations (syrup and capsule) of an Iodine-complex (Renessans). A monolayer of vero cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the presence and absence of different concentrations (equivalent to 50, 05 and 0.5 g/ml of I2) of Renessans. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of each of the formulation was assessed in the form of cell survival, SARS-CoV-2-specific cytopathic effect (CPE) and genome quantization. With varying concentrations of syrup and capsule, a varying rate of inhibition of CPE, cells survival and virus replication was observed. Compared to 0.5 g/ml concentration of Renessans syrup, 5 and 50 g/ml showed comparable results where there was a 100% cell survival, no CPEs and a negligible viral replication ({Delta}CT= 0.11 and 0.13, respectively). This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","Altaf, I.; Nadeem, M.

453,SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like pathological damage and constitutes an antiviral target,"Cytokine storm and multi-organ failure are the main causes of SARS-CoV-2-related death. However, the origin of the virus excessively damaging abilities remains unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is sufficient to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damage in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of 2-E protein induced rapid pyroptosis-like cell death in various susceptible cells and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen. Overexpressed 2-E protein formed cation channels in host cell membranes, eventually leading to membrane rupture. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, their channel inhibition, cell protection and antiviral activities were positively correlated with each other, supporting 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Gao, Z.; Xia, B.; Shen, X.; He, Y.; Pan, X.; Wang, Y.; Yang, F.; Fang, S.; Wu, Y.; Zuo, X.; Xie, Z.; Jiang, X.; Chi, H.; Meng, Q.; Zhou, H.; Zhou, Y.; Cheng, X.; Cheng, T.; Xin, X.; Jiang, H.; Xiao, G.; Zhao, Q.; Zhang, L.-K.; Shen, J.; Li, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.27.174953v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
454,Perversely expressed long noncoding RNAs can alter host response and viral proliferation in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"BackgroundSince December 2019, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.

ResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.

ConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","Turjya, R.

455,Angiotensin-(3-4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection,"The renal lesions – including severe acute kidney injury – are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Luzes, R.; Muzi-Filho, H.; Pereira-Acacio, A.; Crisostomo, T.; Vieyra, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293v1?rss=1,2020-06-29,2020-06-29,,False
456,Comprehensive annotations of the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a fast and accurate pipeline,"In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain).

457,"Integrate Structural Analysis, Isoform Diversity, and Interferon-Inductive Propensity of ACE2 to Refine SARS-CoV2 Susceptibility Prediction in Vertebrates","The current new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused globally near 0.4/6 million confirmed deaths/infected cases across more than 200 countries. As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","Sang, E.

458,A facile Q-RT-PCR assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has infected millions within just a few months and is continuing to spread around the globe causing immense respiratory disease and mortality. Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.

ImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.","Shema Mugisha, C.; Vuong, H.

459,Binding Ability Prediction between Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Reveals the Adaptive Strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in Humans,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.","Xue, X.; Shi, J.; Xu, H.; Qin, Y.; Yang, Z.; Feng, S.; Liu, D.; Jian, L.; Hua, L.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Huang, X.; Zhang, X.; Li, X.; Chen, C.; Guo, J.; Tang, W.; Liu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170704v1?rss=1,2020-06-27,2020-06-27,,False
460,Critical Sequence Hot-spots for Binding of nCOV-2019 to ACE2 as Evaluated by Molecular Simulations,"The novel coronavirus (nCOV-2019) outbreak has put the world on edge, causing millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths all around the world, as of June 2020, let alone the societal and economic impacts of the crisis. The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious.","Ghorbani, M.; Brooks, B.

461,Modified Vaccinia Ankara Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Expressing Full-Length Spike Induces Strong Neutralizing Antibody Response,"There is a great need for the development of vaccines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers.

462,Saliva sampling is an excellent option to increase the number of SARS CoV2 diagnostic tests in settings with supplies shortages,"As part of any plan to lift or ease the confinement restrictions that are in place in many different countries, there is an urgent need to increase the capacity of laboratory testing for SARS CoV-2. Detection of the viral genome through RT-qPCR is the golden standard for this test, however, the high demand of the materials and reagents needed to sample individuals, purify the viral RNA, and perform the RT-qPCR test has resulted in a worldwide shortage of several of these supplies. Here, we show that directly lysed saliva samples can serve as a suitable source for viral RNA detection that is cheaper and can be as efficient as the classical protocol that involves column purification of the viral RNA. In addition, it surpasses the need for swab sampling, decreases the risk of the healthcare personnel involved in this process, and accelerates the diagnostic procedure.","Moreno-Contreras, J.; Espinoza, M.

463,"Structures, conformations and distributions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers on intact virions","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude. Heavily glycosylated S trimers bind the ACE2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells. S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with neutralizing antibodies.","Ke, Z.; Oton, J.; Qu, K.; Cortese, M.; Zila, V.; McKeane, L.; Nakane, T.; Zivanov, J.; Neufeldt, C.

We demonstrate that the method concentrates virus prior to RNA extraction, thus significantly improving detection of the virus using a real-time RT-PCR assay across a range of viral titers, from 100 to 1,000,000 viral copies/mL; in particular, detection of virus in low viral load samples is enhanced when using the method coupled with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit. This method is compatible with commercially available nucleic acid extraction kits, as well with a simple heat and detergent method. Using transport medium diagnostic remnant samples that previously had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 using either the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=14) or the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 EUA Test (n=35), we demonstrate that our method not only correctly identifies all positive samples (n = 17) but also significantly improves detection of the virus in low viral load samples. The average improvement in cycle threshold (Ct) value as measured with the IDT 2019-nCoV CDC EUA Kit was 3.1; n = 10. Finally, to demonstrate that the method could potentially be used to enable pooled testing, we spiked infectious virus or a confirmed positive diagnostic remnant sample into 5 mL and 10 mL of negative transport medium and observed significant improvement in the detection of the virus from those larger sample volumes.","Barclay, R.

465,Tipiracil binds to uridine site and inhibits Nsp15 endoribonuclease NendoU from SARS-CoV-2,"ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease with C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family. It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme’s active site, providing basis for the uracil scaffold-based drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Kim, Y.; Wower, J.; Maltseva, N.; Chang, C.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Wilamowski, M.; Kang, S.; Nicolaescu, V.; Randall, G.; Michalska, K.; Joachimiak, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173872v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False

Reports indicate that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from CNS symptoms. Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of infection are. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection of human brain organoids, clear evidence of infection was observed, with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons. Further, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Finally, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV2, and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV2.","Song, E.; Zhang, C.; Israelow, B.; Lu, P.; Weizman, O.-E.; Liu, F.; Dai, Y.; Szigeti-Buck, K.; Yasumoto, Y.; Wang, G.; Heltke, J.; Ng, E.; Wheeler, J.; Alfajaro, M.

467,Using the nucleocapsid protein to investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses,"An initial outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has resulted in a massive global pandemic causing well over 10,000,000 cases and 500,000 deaths worldwide. The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces and topological variations in the {beta}-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (37S and 267A) were found to exist only in its N protein, along with an extended {beta}-hairpin in the N-Terminal Domain. Collectively, this study strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789, providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein found in these coronaviruses.

We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges that give the globular domain unexpected orientational freedom.

We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamic simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another.

However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed because of privacy legislation. To facilitate integration of any omics data from any data owner world-wide without violating privacy laws, we here introduce Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized machine learning approach uniting edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination as well as privacy protection without the need for a central coordinator thereby going beyond federated learning. Using more than 14,000 blood transcriptomes derived from over 100 individual studies with non-uniform distribution of cases and controls and significant study biases, we illustrate the feasibility of SL to develop disease classifiers based on distributed data for COVID-19, tuberculosis or leukemias that outperform those developed at individual sites.

Because human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing the human ACE2 gene have shown promise as a potential model for COVID-19. Five mice from the transgenic mouse strain K18-hACE2 were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Hong Kong/VM20001061/2020. Mice were followed twice daily for five days and scored for weight loss and clinical symptoms. Infected mice did not exhibit any signs of infection until day four, when weight loss, but no other obvious clinical symptoms were observed. By day five all infected mice had lost around 10% of their original body weight, but exhibited variable clinical symptoms. All infected mice showed high viral titers in the lungs as well as altered lung histology associated with proteinaceous debris in the alveolar space, interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and alveolar septal thickening. Overall, these results show that symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection can be established in the K18-hACE2 transgenic background and should be a useful mouse model for COVID-19 disease.","Moreau, G.

473,Glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Control the Receptor Binding Domain Conformation,"The glycan shield of the beta-coronavirus (β-CoV) Spike (S) glycoprotein provides protection from host immune responses, acting as a steric block to potentially neutralizing antibody responses. The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) ‘up’ and ‘down’ state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the ‘up’ state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in ‘up’ state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element.

474,Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane,"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Wang, J.; Fortoul, N.; Zhang, X.

Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.

Author summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection.

477,Elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of cystine and theanine through transcriptome analysis of mice and comparison with COVID-19 gene set data,"We previously showed that oral administration of cystine and theanine (CT) to mice confers resistance to influenza virus infection. In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.","Mitsui, A.; Sakai, R.; Miwa, K.; Shibahara, S.; Kurihara, S.; Nagao, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.149427v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False

They widely exist in the environment, with characteristics of variety, spreading quickly and easily causing adverse reactions. In this work, an Ag-based material is used to be incorporated and functionalized in polycotton fabrics using pad-dry-cure method. This composite proved to be effective for inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decreasing the number of replicates in 99.99% after an incubation period of 2 minutes. In addition, it caused 99.99% inhibition of the pathogens S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans, preventing cross-infections and does not cause allergies or photoirritation processes, demonstrating the safety of its use.","Tremiliosi, G.

Indoor locations are more likely environments for the diffusion of the virus contagion among people, but direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in air or on surfaces is quite sparse, especially regarding public transport. In fact, an important demand is to know how and if it is safe to use them. To understand the possible spreading of COVID-19 inside a city bus during normal operation and the effectiveness of the protective measures adopted for transportation, we analysed the air and the surfaces most usually touched by passengers. The measurements were carried out across the last week of the lockdown and the first week when gradually all the travel restrictions were removed.","Di Carlo, P.; Chiacchiaretta, P.; Sinjari, B. d.; Aruffo, E.; Stuppia, L.; De Laurenzi, V.; Di Tomo, P.; Pelusi, L.; Potenza, F.; Veronese, A.; Vecchiet, J.; Falasca, K.; Ucciferri, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173146v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.173146v1?rss=1,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,,False
480,"Molecular features similarities between SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS and key human genes could favour the viral infections and trigger collateral effects","In December 2019 rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel {beta}-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide causing thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses. The results presented here, settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.","Maldonado, L.; Kamenetzky, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167072v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167072v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False
481,Cellular exocytosis gene (EXOC6/6B): a potential molecular link for the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19 in diabetic patients,"Diabetes is one of the most critical comorbidities linked to an increased risk of severe complications in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A better molecular understanding of COVID-19 in people with type diabetes mellitus (T2D) is mandatory, especially in countries with a high rate of T2D, such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6/6B compared to healthy lungs.

In conclusion, our data suggest that EXOC6/6B might be an important molecular link between dysfunctional pancreatic islets and ciliated lung epithelium that makes diabetic patients more susceptible to severe SARS-COV-2 complication.","Taneera, J.; Hachim, M.

482,Increased Expression of Chondroitin Sulfotransferases following AngII may Contribute to Pathophysiology Underlying Covid-19 Respiratory Failure: Impact may be Exacerbated by Decline in Arylsulfatase B Activity,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to respiratory epithelium through the ACE2 receptor, an endogenous receptor for Angiotensin II (AngII). The mechanisms by which this viral infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. In this brief report, we present data indicating that stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by AngII leads to increased expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for the synthesis of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE). We suggest that increased expression of these chondroitin sulfotransferases and the ensuing production of chondroitin sulfates may contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to the progression of respiratory disease in Covid-19. The enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase), which removes 4-sulfate groups from the non-reducing end of chondroitin 4-sulfate residues, is required for degradation of C4S and CSE. In hypoxic conditions or following treatment with chloroquine, ARSB activity is reduced. Decline in ARSB can contribute to ongoing accumulation and airway obstruction by C4S and CSE. Decline in ARSB leads to increased expression of Interleukin(IL)-6 in human bronchial epithelial cells, and IL-6 is associated with cytokine storm in Covid-19. These findings indicate how chondroitin sulfates, chondroitin sulfotransferases, and chondroitin sulfatases may participate in the progression of hypoxic respiratory insufficiency in Covid-19 disease and suggest new therapeutic targets.","Bhattacharyya, S.; Kotlo, K.; Tobacman, J.

483,Chasing the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada's COVID-19 cases: A genomics study,"The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has had profound social and economic consequences and has shed light on the importance of continued and additional investment in global health and infectious disease surveillance. Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2.

484,Antiviral Drug Screen of Kinase inhibitors Identifies Cellular Signaling Pathways Critical for SARS-CoV-2 Replication,"Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies. Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus, identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials. Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells. Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

485,The discovery of potential natural products for targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by virtual screening,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters into the cells through its spike proteins binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein and causes virus infection in host cells. Until now, there are no available antiviral drugs have been reported that can effectively block virus infection. The study aimed to discover the potential compounds to prevent viral spike proteins to bind to the human ACE2 proteins from Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds (TDEC) by structure-based virtual screening. In this study, to rapidly discover potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, the molecular docking calculation was performed by AutoDock Vina program. Herein, we found that 39 potential compounds may have good binding affinities and can respectively bind to the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in the prefusion conformation and spike-ACE2 complex protein in silico. Among those compounds, especially natural products thioflexibilolide A and candidine that were respectively isolated from the soft corals Sinularia flexibilis and Phaius mishmensis may have better binding affinity than others.

486,Molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 structural genes: evidence of positive selection in spike glycoprotein,"SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in early 2020 and has resulted in more than 8,000,000 infections as well as 430,000 deaths in the world so far. Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isnt detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","Zhan, X.-Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhou, X.; Huang, K.; Qian, Y.; Leng, Y.; Yan, L.; Huang, B.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688v1?rss=1,2020-06-25,2020-06-25,,False

488,"Stroke increases the expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, in murine lungs","BackgroundThe newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic of human respiratory disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated.

MethodsMice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1{beta} were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

ResultsStrikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are the gold standard for detecting viral RNA in patient samples and are used extensively in clinical settings. Most currently used quantitative PCR (RT-qPCRs) rely upon real-time detection of PCR product using specialized laboratory equipment. To enable the application of PCR in resource-poor or non-specialist laboratories, we have developed and evaluated a nested PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using simple agarose gel electrophoresis for product detection. Using clinical samples tested by conventional qPCR methods and RNA transcripts of defined RNA copy number, the nested PCR based on the RdRP gene demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in clinical samples, but showed variable and transcript length-dependent sensitivity for RNA transcripts. Samples and transcripts were further evaluated in an additional N protein real-time quantitative PCR assay. As determined by 50% endpoint detection, the sensitivities of three RT-qPCRs and nested PCR methods varied substantially depending on the transcript target with no method approaching single copy detection. Overall, these findings highlight the need for assay validation and optimization and demonstrate the inability to precisely compare viral quantification from different PCR methodologies without calibration.","Ratcliff, J.; Nguyen, D.; Andersson, M.; Simmonds, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.168013v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.168013v1?rss=1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,,False
491,SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in human fetal and pediatric gastric organoids,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global public health emergency. COVID-19 typically manifests as a respiratory illness but an increasing number of clinical reports describe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. This is particularly true in children in whom GI symptoms are frequent and viral shedding outlasts viral clearance from the respiratory system. By contrast, fetuses seem to be rarely affected by COVID-19, although the virus has been detected in placentas of affected women. These observations raise the question of whether the virus can infect and replicate within the stomach once ingested. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether active replication of SARS-CoV-2 is possible in the stomach of children or in fetuses at different developmental stages. Here we show the novel derivation of fetal gastric organoids from 8-21 post-conception week (PCW) fetuses, and from pediatric biopsies, to be used as an in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 gastric infection. Gastric organoids recapitulate human stomach with linear increase of gastric mucin 5AC along developmental stages, and expression of gastric markers pepsinogen, somatostatin, gastrin and chromogranin A. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal perturbation and under steady-state conditions, we induced a reversed polarity in the gastric organoids (RP-GOs) in suspension. In this condition of exposed apical polarity, the virus can easily access viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The pediatric RP-GOs are fully susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, where viral nucleoprotein is expressed in cells undergoing programmed cell death, while the efficiency of infection is significantly lower in fetal organoids. The RP-GOs derived from pediatric patients show sustained robust viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, compared with organoids derived from fetal stomachs. Transcriptomic analysis shows a moderate innate antiviral response and the lack of differentially expressed genes belonging to the interferon family. Collectively, we established the first expandable human gastric organoid culture across fetal developmental stages, and we support the hypothesis that fetal tissue seems to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in early stages of development. However, the virus can efficiently infect gastric epithelium in pediatric patients, suggesting that the stomach might have an active role in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Giobbe, G.

Various research groups are working toward development of vaccines and drugs, and many have published genomic and transcriptomic data related to this viral infection. The power inherent in publicly available data can be demonstrated via comparative transcriptome analyses. In the current study, we collected high-throughput gene expression data related to human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses (SARS, H1N1, rhinovirus, avian influenza, and Dhori) and compared the effect of these viruses on the human transcriptome. The analyses identified fifteen genes specifically expressed in cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2; these included CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and S100A8 and S100A9 (calcium-binding proteins), all of which are involved in lung/respiratory disorders. The analyses showed that genes involved in the Type1 interferon signaling pathway and the apoptosis process are commonly altered by infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.

493,CoronaHiT: large scale multiplexing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes using Nanopore sequencing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started in China in late 2019. Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 24 samples at a time. There is a need for a higher throughput method to reduce cost per genome. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 95 small genomes on a single Nanopore flowcell, which uses transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of symmetric barcodes. We demonstrate the method using 48 and 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per flowcell, amplified using the ARTIC protocol, and compare performance with Illumina and ARTIC ONT sequencing. Results demonstrate that all sequencing methods produce inaccurate genomes when the RNA extract from SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical sample has a cycle threshold (Ct) >= 32. Results from set same set of 23 samples with a broad range of Cts show that the consensus genomes have >90% coverage (GISAID criteria) for 78.2% of samples for CoronaHiT-48, 73.9% for CoronaHiT-94, 78.2% for Illumina and 73.9% for ARTIC ONT, and all have the same clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 94 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per nanopore flowcell without compromising the quality of the resulting genomes while reducing library preparation complexity and significantly reducing cost. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally, to help control the pandemic.","Baker, D. J.; Kay, G. L.; Aydin, A.; Le-Viet, T.; Rudder, S.; Tedim, A.

494,"Pixatimod (PG545), a clinical-stage heparan sulfate mimetic, is a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus","A major global effort is currently ongoing to search for therapeutics and vaccines to treat or prevent infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Repurposing existing entities is one attractive approach. The heparan sulfate mimetic pixatimod is a clinical-stage synthetic sulfated compound that is a potent inhibitor of the glycosidase heparanase, and has known anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and also antiviral properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) and alters its conformation. Notably, this site overlaps with the known ACE2 binding site in the S1 RBD. We find that pixatimod inhibits binding of recombinant S1 RBD to Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover, in assays with three different isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus we show that pixatimod effectively inhibits viral infection of Vero cells. Importantly, its potency is well within its safe therapeutic dose range. These data provide evidence that pixatimod is a potent antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2. Together with its other known activities this provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation as a new multimodal therapeutic for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Guimond, S.

495,Intestinal receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in inflamed IBD tissue is downregulated by HNF4A in ileum and upregulated by interferon regulating factors in colon,"Patients with IBD are considered immunosuppressed, but do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19. Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.

We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 dysregulation in responders.

Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.","Verstockt, B.; Verstockt, S.; Adbu Rahiman, S.; Ke, B.-J.; Arnauts, K.; Cleynen, I.; Sabino, J.; Ferrante, M.; Matteoli, G.; Vermeire, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169383v1?rss=1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,,False

An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral pathogenicity.","Cox, B.

497,Lung expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules and antiviral restriction factors: interindividual differences are associated with age and germline variants,"Germline variants in genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2) may influence the susceptibility to infection, as may polymorphisms in genes involved in the innate host response to viruses (e.g. APOBEC3 family). We searched for polymorphisms acting, in lung tissue, as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, whose expression levels did not associate with either sex or age of the 408 patients whose non-diseased lung tissue was analyzed. Instead, we identified seven cis-eQTLs (FDR<0.05) for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G (rs139296, rs9611092, rs139331, rs8177832, rs17537581, rs61362448, and rs738469). The genetic control of the expression of APOBEC3 genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication, may explain interindividual differences in risk or severity of viral infections. Future studies should investigate the role of host genetics in COVID-19 patients using a genome-wide approach, to identify other genes whose expression levels are associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

Author summaryIdentification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has become commonplace in functional studies on the role of individual genetic variants in susceptibility to diseases. In COVID-19, it has been proposed that individual variants in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and innate host response genes may influence the susceptibility to infection. We searched for polymorphisms acting, in non-diseased lung tissue of 408 patients, as eQTLs for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. Seven cis-eQTLs were detected for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. Therefore, the identified eQTLs may represent candidate loci modulating interindividual differences in risk or severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","Cotroneo, C. E.; Mangano, N.; Dragani, T.

498,"Development of a fluorescence based, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro reporter assay","In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro. 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro. This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.

IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 400,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro. This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis.

The N-glycan structure and composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.Objective To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.Methods We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23 glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.Results Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8. Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.Conclusions A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies. Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine development work.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Krishnan, S.; Krishnan, G.

501,"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization","STUDY QUESTIONIs SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) expressed in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle, and does it participate in endometrial decidualization?

SUMMARY ANSWERACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONProliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEIn human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05).

LARGE SCALE DATAN/A.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONExperiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSExpression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

502,A nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 for rapid neutralization testing and screening of anti-infective drugs for COVID-19,"A high-throughput platform would greatly facilitate COVID-19 serological testing and antiviral screening. Here we report a nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. We demonstrate that the optimized reporter virus assay in Vero E6 cells can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera and produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluated a collection of approved and investigational antivirals and other anti-infective drugs. Nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat were identified as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 M). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 M.

506,An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is the viral pathogen causing the COVID19 global pandemic. Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (""priming"") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases. Nafamostat and camostat are currently in clinical trials against COVID19. The rank order potency for the three inhibitors is: nafamostat (IC50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC50 = 6.2 nM) and gabexate (IC50 = 130 nM).

Here, we propose climate plays an important role in the evolution of SARS CoV-2 and the spread of COVID-19 all over the world which was previously not known. To understand the climatic factors responsible for shaping the molecular determinants of the novel coronavirus, genotyping SARS CoV-2 across different latitudes and Koppens climate is imperative. It seems this virus follows inverse latitudinal biodiversity gradient due to its preference towards Koppens temperate (C) and cold climate (D). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed division of 176 SARS CoV-2 strains into two variant groups, G1 and G2, well defined by four mutations. Initially, SARS CoV-2 was restricted to a ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) climate of southeast China, which soon spread all over the world having C climate. Genomic information superimposed on global Koppens climate map elucidates that the gradation ""humid-subtropical"" (Cfa) and ""marine-temperate"" (Cfb) to ""humid-continental"" (Dfa-Dfb) climate drives the evolution of G1 into G2 variant group. It seems an early infection in Europe and USA is due to the dominance of C climate. Russia and North America were infected through linkage of C to D climate and South America from C to A climate. Our study elucidates viruses are sensitive to climate and combined genomic and climatic studies provide crucial information about the pathogenesis and natural spreading pathways during a pandemic which will enable us to take pre-emptive precautionary measures in such outbreaks.

508,Structure-Based Design with Tag-Based Purification and In-Process Biotinylation Enable Streamlined Development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Molecular Probes,"Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from [~]0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.","Zhou, T.; Teng, I.-T.; Olia, A.

509,Loss of pH switch unique to SARS-CoV2 supports unfamiliar virus pathology,"Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. This paper compares the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions for SARS-CoV (CoV1) and CoV2. At low (endosomal) pH, the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 interactions with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is almost the same. However, at neutral pH the landscape is different due to the loss of a pH-switch (His445Lys) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2 relative to CoV1. Namely, CoV1 stabilizes a transition state above the bound state. In situations where small external strains are applied by, say, shear flow in the respiratory system, the off rate of the viral particle is enhanced. As a result, CoV1 virions are expected to detach from cell surfaces in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for other receptors to reach out and stabilize virus attachment. On the other hand, the loss of this pH-switch, which sequence alignments show is unique to CoV2, eliminates the transition state and allows the virus to stay bound to the ACE2 receptor for time scales compatible with the recruitment of additional ACE2 receptors diffusing in the cell membrane. This has important implications for viral infection and its pathology. CoV1 does not trigger high infectivity in the nasal area because it either rapidly drifts down the respiratory tract or is exhaled. By contrast, this novel mutation in CoV2 should not only retain the infection in the nasal cavity until ACE2-rich cells are sufficiently depleted, but also require fewer particles for infection. This mechanism explains observed longer incubation times, extended period of viral shedding, and higher rate of transmission. These considerations governing viral entry suggest that number of ACE2-rich cells in human nasal mucosa, which should be significantly smaller for children (and females relative to males), should also correlate with onset of viral load that could be a determinant of higher virus susceptibility. Critical implications for the development of new vaccines to combat current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates by viral retention in nasal epithelium are also discussed.","Camacho, C.

510,SARS-CoV-2 mutations altering regulatory properties: deciphering host's and virus's perspectives,"Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its genome while spreading throughout the globe. However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, A.

Tmprss1, Tmprss3, and Tmprss5 are expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and the organ of Corti in the inner ear; however, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the middle ear remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression in the middle and inner ear of mice.

Study DesignAnimal research.

SettingDepartment of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, University of Tokyo.

MethodsWe performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the eustachian tube, middle ear space, and cochlea of mice.

ResultsAce2 was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear epithelium, eustachian tube epithelium, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion. Tmprss2 and Furin were widely expressed in the middle ear spaces and the cochlea.

ConclusionCo-expression of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the middle ear indicates that the middle ear is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus warranting the use of personal protective equipment during mastoidectomy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients.","Uranaka, T.; Kashio, A.; Ueha, R.; Sato, T.; Han, B.; Gao, Y.; Kinoshita, M.; Kondo, K.; Yamasoba, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.164335v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.164335v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
512,A graph-based approach identifies dynamic H-bond communication networks in spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2,"Corona virus spike protein S is a large homo-trimeric protein embedded in the membrane of the virion particle. Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","Karathanou, K.; Lazaratos, M.; Bertalan, E.; Siemers, M.; Buzar, K.; Schertler, G.

513,"Accommodating individual travel history, global mobility, and unsampled diversity in phylogeography: a SARS-CoV-2 case study.","Spatiotemporal bias in genome sequence sampling can severely confound phylogeographic inference based on discrete trait ancestral reconstruction. This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.","Lemey, P.; Hong, S.; Hill, V.; Baele, G.; Poletto, C.; Colizza, V.; O'Toole, A.; McCrone, J.

514,"Green tea and Spirulina extracts inhibit SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 spike pseudotyped virus entry in vitro","Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of animals and birds. Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.","Joseph, J.; Thankamani, K.; Ajay, A.; Das, V. R. A.; Raj, V.

516,Modeling the effect of COVID-19 disease on the cardiac function: a computational study,"BackgroundThe effect of COVID-19 on the cardiac function and on the vascular system increases the morbidity and mortality of infected subjects with cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectivesTo provide preliminary results on cardiac global outcomes (such as cardiac output, ventricular pressures) obtained by means of computational models in plausible scenarios characterized by COVID-19.

MethodsWe considered a lumped parameters computational model of the cardiovascular system, which models, from the mechanical point of view, the systemic and pulmonary circulations, the four cardiac valves and the four heart chambers, through mathematical equations of the underlying physical processes. To study the effect of COVID-19, we varied in suitable ranges the heart rate, the contractility and the pulmonary resistances.

ResultsOur computations on individuals with both otherwise normal and impaired cardiac functions revealed that COVID-19 worsen cardiac function, as shown by a decrease of some cardiac biomarkers values such as cardiac output and ejection fraction. In the case of existing impaired cardiac function, the presence of COVID-19 lead to values outside the normal ranges.

ConclusionsComputational models revealed to be an effective tool to study the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Such effect could be significant for patients with impaired cardiac function. This is especially useful to perform a sensitivity analysis of the hemodynamics for different conditions.

CONDENSED ABSTRACTEmerging studies address how COVID-19 infection might impacts the cardiovascular system. This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients.

Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney. ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of ACEi/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi/ARB use in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease.

There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19 characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four important observations: (i)Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2 and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic. Finally, because BSG is functions in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis, our observations may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with aging.","Ahmetaj-Shala, B.; Vaja, R.-K.; Atanur, S.

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Moroccan patients revealed 62 mutations of which 30 were missense mutations. The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred one time in our sequences with no record in other sequence worldwide. These mutations should be investigated to figure out their potential effects on all around the world virulence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses pertaining to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C. This finding suggest that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. For multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country.

521,Biochemical evidence of furin specificity and potential for phospho-regulation at Spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site in SARS-CoV2 but not in SARS-CoV1 or MERS-CoV,"The Spike protein of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 contains an insertion 680SPRRAR{downarrow}SV687 forming a cleavage motif RxxR for furin-like enzymes at the boundary of S1/S2 subunits. Cleavage at S1/S2 is important for efficient viral entry into target cells. The insertion is absent in other CoV-s of the same clade, including SARS-CoV1 that caused the 2003 outbreak. However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR{downarrow}SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site. Although phosphoregulation of secreted proteins is still poorly understood, further studies, supported by a recent report of ten in vivo phosphorylated sites in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, could potentially uncover important novel regulatory mechanisms for SARS-CoV2.","Örd, M.; Faustova, I.; Loog, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.166900v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
522,ViralLink: An integrated workflow to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on intracellular signalling and regulatory pathways,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2020 has mobilised scientists around the globe to research all aspects of the coronavirus virus and its infection. For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. The workflow is available on GitHub (https://github.com/korcsmarosgroup/ViralLink) in an easily accessible Python wrapper script, or as customisable modular R and Python scripts.Author summary Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets and speeds the process of discovery. Such ways of working are especially important at present due to the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we present a systems biology workflow which models the effect of viral proteins on the infected host cell, to aid collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily applied to different datasets as they are made available. Application to diverse SARS-CoV-2 datasets will increase our understanding of the mechanistic details of the infection at a cell type specific level, aid drug target discovery and help explain the variety of clinical manifestations of the infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","Treveil, A.; Bohar, B.; Sudhakar, P.; Gul, L.; Csabai, L.; Olbei, M.; Poletti, M.; Madgwick, M.; Andrighetti, T.; Hautefort, I.; Modos, D.; Korcsmaros, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167254v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167254v1?rss=1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,,False
523,SARS-CoV-2 structure and replication characterized by in situ cryo-electron tomography,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID19 pandemic, is a highly pathogenic {beta}-coronavirus. As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped and remodels intracellular membranes for genome replication and assembly. Here, we report critical insights into the budding mechanism of the virus and provide structural details of virions and virus induced double-membrane vesicles by in situ cryo-electron tomography. We directly visualized double-stranded RNA within double-membrane vesicles, forming a loosely organized network with frequent RNA branching consistent with template-directed RNA synthesis intermediates. Our data indicate that membrane bending is orchestrated by the spike trimer and viral ribonucleoprotein complex recruitment into virion budding sites, suggesting the synergistic interplay of both viral components as a possible drug target for intervention.","Klein, S.; Cortese, M.; Winter, S.

524,Mathematical modeling explains differential SARS CoV-2 kinetics in lung and nasal passages in remdesivir treated rhesus macaques,"Remdesivir was recently demonstrated to decrease recovery time in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In rhesus macaques, early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and lowered viral loads in the lung, but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy. We developed mathematical models to explain these results. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung.

525,Endemic human coronaviruses induce distinct antibody repertoires in adults and children,"Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory infection in humans but immune responses to these ""common cold"" viruses remain incompletely understood. Moreover, there is evidence emerging from independent studies which suggests that endemic HCoVs can induce broadly cross-reactive T cell responses and may thereby affect clinical outcomes of acute infections with the phylogenetically related epidemic viruses, namely MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here we report a comprehensive retrospective analysis of CoV-specific antibody specificities in a large number of samples from children and adults using Phage-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). We estimate the seroprevalence for endemic HCoVs to range from ~4% to ~27% depending on species and cohort. Most importantly, we identified a large number of novel linear B cell epitopes of HCoV proteins and demonstrate that antibody repertoires against endemic HCoVs are qualitatively different in children in comparison to the general adult population and healthy adult blood bank donors. We show that anti-HCoV IgG specificities more frequently found among children target functionally important and structurally conserved regions of the HCoV spike and nucleocapsid proteins and some antibody specificities are broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and non-human coronavirus isolates. Our findings shed light on the humoral immune responses to natural infection with endemic HCoVs and may have important implications for understanding of the highly variable clinical outcomes of human coronavirus infections, for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design.","Khan, T.; Rahman, M.; Al Ali, F.; Huang, S.

526,Female reproductive tract has low concentration of SARS-CoV2 receptors,"There has been significant concern regarding fertility and reproductive outcomes during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is unlikely to contribute to pregnancy-related adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk, oogenesis and female fertility.","Goad, J.; Rudolph, J.; Rajkovic, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163097v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False

Malayan pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-2) is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. We show that CT scans of virus-positive pangolins reveal bilateral ground-glass opacities in lungs in similar manner to COVID-19 patients. The virus infected multiple organs in pangolins, with the lungs being the major target. Histological expression showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed with viral RNA. Transcriptome analysis revealed an inadequate interferon response, with different dysregulated chemokines and cytokines responses in pregnant and non-pregnant adults and fetuses. Viral RNA and protein were detected in three fetuses providing evidence for vertical virus transmission.

528,Functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a complex inflammatory response and metabolic alterations,"Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has reached the category of a worldwide pandemic. Even though intensive efforts, no effective treatments or a vaccine are available. Molecular characterization of the transcriptional response in Covid-19 patients could be helpful to identify therapeutic targets. In this study, RNAseq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls was analyzed from a functional point of view using probabilistic graphical models. Two networks were built: one based on genes differentially expressed between healthy and infected individuals and another one based on the 2,000 most variable genes in terms of expression in order to make a functional characterization. In the network based on differentially expressed genes, two inflammatory response nodes with different tendencies were identified, one related to cytokines and chemokines, and another one related to bacterial infections. In addition, differences in metabolism, which were studied in depth using Flux Balance Analysis, were identified. SARS-CoV2-infection caused alterations in glutamate, methionine and cysteine, and tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism. In the network based on 2,000 most variable genes, also two inflammatory nodes with different tendencies between healthy individuals and patients were identified. Similar to the other network, one was related to cytokines and chemokines. However, the other one, lower in Covid-19 patients, was related to allergic processes and self-regulation of the immune response. Also, we identified a decrease in T cell node activity and an increase in cell division node activity. In the current absence of treatments for these patients, functional characterization of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be helpful to define targetable processes. Therefore, these results may be relevant to propose new treatments.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection caused Covid-19 which has reached the category of a worldwide pandemic. However, no treatments or vaccines are still available. For this reason, it is still necessary the molecular study of this disease. In this study, we reanalyzed data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Covid-19 patients and healthy controls using computational techniques that allow the study of differential biological processes and metabolic pathways. The results suggested a complex inflammatory response, involving genes related to response to bacterial infection and allergic processes, and alterations in metabolic pathways such as glutamate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism or tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism.

529,"In vivo antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age","Despite limited genomic diversity, SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA-sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor, CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of NF-{kappa}B signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","Lieberman, N.

530,Generation of SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike glycoprotein putative antigenic epitopes in vitro by intracellular aminopeptidases,"Presentation of antigenic peptides by MHCI is central to cellular immune responses against viral pathogens. While adaptive immune responses versus SARS-CoV-2 can be of critical importance to both recovery and vaccine efficacy, how protein antigens from this pathogen are processed to generate antigenic peptides is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of overlapping precursor peptides spanning the entire sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, by three key enzymes that generate antigenic peptides, aminopeptidases ERAP1, ERAP2 and IRAP. All enzymes generated shorter peptides with sequences suitable for binding onto HLA alleles, but with distinct specificity fingerprints. ERAP1 was the most efficient in generating peptides 8-11 residues long, the optimal length for HLA binding, while IRAP was the least efficient. The combination of ERAP1 with ERAP2 greatly limited the variability of peptide sequences produced. Less than 7% of computationally predicted epitopes were found to be produced experimentally, suggesting that aminopeptidase processing may constitute a significant filter to epitope presentation. These experimentally generated putative epitopes could be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity studies and vaccine design. We furthermore propose that this in vitro trimming approach could constitute a general filtering method to enhance the prediction robustness for viral antigenic epitopes.","Stamatakis, G.; Samiotaki, M.; Mpakali, A.; Panayotou, G.; Stratikos, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164681v1?rss=1,2020-06-22,2020-06-22,,False

Several key studies have elucidated functions of few other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in miRNAs biogenesis, making it necessary to look miRNA biogenesis models with fresh approach.

ResultsA comprehensive study of >25TB of high-throughput data revealed that various combinations of RBPs and their networks determine the miRNA pool, regardless of DROSHA/DICER. The discovered RBP and miRNA associations displayed strong functional alliances. An RBP, AAR2, was found highly associated with miRNAs biogenesis, which was experimentally validated. The RBPs combinations and networks were tested successfully across a large number of experimentally validated data and cell lines for the observed associations. The RBP networks were finally modeled into a XGBoosting-regression based tool to identify miRNA profiles without any need of doing miRNA-seq, which scored a reliable average accuracy of 91% on test sets. It was further tested across >400 independent experimental samples and scored consistently high accuracy. This tool was applied to reveal the miRNAome of Covid19 patients about which almost negligible information exists. A significant number of Covid19 specific miRNA targets were involved in IFN-gamma, Insulin/IGF/P3K/AKT, and Ub-proteasome systems, found in cross-talk with each other and down-regulated heavily, holding promise as strong candidates for therapeutic solution.

535,"Genomic diversity and hotspot mutations in 30,983 SARS-CoV-2 genomes: moving toward a universal vaccine for the ""confined virus""?","The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late November 2019 in Wuhan, China. To date, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 8 million people worldwide and killed over 5% of them. Efforts are being made all over the world to control the spread of the disease and most importantly to develop a vaccine. Understanding the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographic characteristics and stability is particularly important for developing a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and for predicting its efficacy. In this perspective, we analyzed the sequences of 30,983 complete genomes from 80 countries located in six geographical zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North & South America, and Oceania) isolated from December 24, 2019 to May 13, 2020, and compared them to the reference genome. Our in-depth analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites compared to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, with a distribution that is largely uniform over all continents. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations was observed; only 182 mutations (5.67%) had a prevalence greater than 1%. Nevertheless, fourteen hotspot mutations (> 10%) were identified at different locations, seven at the ORF1ab gene (in regions coding for nsp2, nsp3, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15), three in the nucleocapsid protein, one in the spike protein, one in orf3a, and one in orf8. Moreover, 35 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human receptor ACE2.

These results along with the phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that the virus does not have a significant divergence at the protein level compared to the reference both among and within different geographical areas. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the slow rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes the potential of developing an effective global vaccine very likely.","Alouane, T.; Laamarti, M.; Essabbar, A.; Hakmi, M.; Bouricha, E.

537,A path towards SARS-CoV-2 attenuation: metabolic pressure on CTP synthesis rules the virus evolution,"Fighting the COVID-19 epidemic summons deep understanding of the way SARS-CoV-2 taps into its host cell metabolic resources. We describe here the singular metabolic background that creates a bottleneck constraining coronaviruses to evolve towards likely attenuation in the long term. Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the biosynthetic processes that allow the virus to multiply. This is because CTP is in demand for three essential steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope and, finally, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis. The CCA 3-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate (UTP) that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. We also highlight and provide a raison detre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3-deoxy-3',4-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","Ou, Z.; Ouzounis, C.; Wang, D.; Sun, W.; Li, J.; Chen, W.; Marliere, P.; Danchin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.162933v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False
538,SARS-CoV-2 infection of African green monkeys results in mild respiratory disease discernible by PET/CT imaging and prolonged shedding of infectious virus from both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts,"Vaccines are urgently needed to combat the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and testing of candidate vaccines in an appropriate non-human primate (NHP) model is a critical step in the process. Infection of African green monkeys (AGM) with a low passage human isolate of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol or mucosal exposure resulted in mild clinical infection with a transient decrease in lung tidal volume. Imaging with human clinical-grade 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) co-registered with computed tomography (CT) revealed pulmonary lesions at 4 days post-infection (dpi) that resolved over time. Infectious virus was shed from both respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts in all animals in a biphasic manner, first between 2-7 dpi followed by a recrudescence at 14-21 dpi. Viral RNA (vRNA) was found throughout both respiratory and gastrointestinal systems at necropsy with higher levels of vRNA found within the GI tract tissues. All animals seroconverted simultaneously for IgM and IgG, which has also been documented in human COVID-19 cases. Young AGM represent an excellent species to study mild/subclinical COVID-19 disease and have shed light on unknown aspects of long-term virus shedding. They are ideally suited for preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutic interventions.

540,anti-IL-6 versus anti-IL-6R Blocking Antibodies to Treat Acute Ebola Infection in BALB/c Mice with Potential Implications for Treating Patients Presenting with COVID-19,"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is known to be a factor in morbidity and mortality associated with acute viral infections including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. IL-6 has been implicated as a cytokine negatively associated with survival after filovirus infection. However, IL-6 has also been shown to be an important mediator of innate immunity, important for the host response to an acute viral infection. Clinical studies are now being conducted by various researchers to evaluate the possible role of IL-6 blockers to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of these studies involve the use of anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We present data showing that direct neutralization of IL-6 with an anti-IL-6 mAb in a BALB/c Ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge model produced a statistically significant improvement in outcome compared with controls when administered within the first 24 hours of challenge and repeated every 72 hours. A similar effect was seen in mice treated with the same dose of anti-IL-6R mAb when the treatment was delayed 48 hrs post-challenge. These data suggest that direct neutralization of IL-6, early during the course of infection, may provide additional clinical benefits to IL-6 receptor blockade alone during treatment of patients with virus-induced CRS. These results may have implications for selecting and managing IL-6 blockade therapy for patients with COVID-19.","Rubsamen, R.

541,Characterizing transcriptional regulatory sequences in coronaviruses and their role in recombination,"Novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, often originate from recombination events. The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","Yang, Y.; Yan, W.; Hall, B.; Jiang, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163410v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163410v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False
542,RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase From SARS-CoV-2. Mechanism Of Reaction And Inhibition By Remdesivir.,"We combine sequence analysis, molecular dynamics and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to obtain the first description of the mechanism of reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and of the inhibition of the enzyme by Remdesivir. Despite its evolutionary youth, the enzyme is highly optimized to have good fidelity in nucleotide incorporation and a good catalytic efficiency. Our simulations strongly suggest that Remdesivir triphosphate (the active form of drug) is incorporated into the nascent RNA replacing ATP, leading to a duplex RNA which is structurally very similar to an unmodified one. We did not detect any reason to explain the inhibitory activity of Remdesivir at the active site. Displacement of the nascent Remdesivir-containing RNA duplex along the exit channel of the enzyme can occur without evident steric clashes which would justify delayed inhibition. However, after the incorporation of three more nucleotides we found a hydrated Serine which is placed in a perfect arrangement to react through a Pinners reaction with the nitrile group of Remdesivir. Kinetic barriers for crosslinking and polymerization are similar suggesting a competition between polymerization and inhibition. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape and structural analysis of polymerases across different species support the proposed mechanism and suggest that virus has not explored yet resistance to Remdesivir inhibition.","Aranda, J.; Orozco, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163592v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163592v1?rss=1,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,,False
543,"Rapid Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Silicon Nitride, Copper, and Aluminum Nitride","IntroductionViral disease spread by contaminated commonly touched surfaces is a global concern. Silicon nitride, an industrial ceramic that is also used as an implant in spine surgery, has known antibacterial activity. The mechanism of antibacterial action relates to the hydrolytic release of surface disinfectants. It is hypothesized that silicon nitride can also inactivate the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to 15 wt.% aqueous suspensions of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, and copper particles. The virus was titrated by the TCD50 method using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, while viral RNA was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunostaining and Raman spectroscopy were used as additional probes to investigate the cellular responses to virions exposed to the respective materials.

ResultsAll three tested materials showed >99% viral inactivation at one and ten minutes of exposure. Degradation of viral RNA was also observed with all materials. Immunofluorescence testing showed that silicon nitride-treated virus failed to infect VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells without damaging them. In contrast, the copper-treated virus suspension severely damaged the cells due to copper ion toxicity. Raman spectroscopy indicated differential biochemical cellular changes due to infection and metal toxicity for two of the three materials tested.

ConclusionsSilicon nitride successfully inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The mechanism of action was the hydrolysis-mediated surface release of nitrogen-containing disinfectants. Both aluminum nitride and copper were also effective in the inactivation of the virus. However, while the former compound affected the cells, the latter compound had a cytopathic effect. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and investigate whether silicon nitride can be incorporated into personal protective equipment and commonly touched surfaces, as a strategy to discourage viral persistence and disease spread.","Pezzotti, G.; Ohgitani, E.; Shin-Ya, M.; Adachi, T.; Marin, E.; Boschetto, F.; Zhu, W.; Mazda, O.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.159970v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.159970v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False

545,"Structural variability, expression profile and pharmacogenetics properties of TMPRSS2 gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy","The human serine protease TMPRSS2 gene is involved in the priming of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins being one of the possible targets for COVID-19 therapy. TMPRSS2 gene is possibly co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes ACE2 and BSG, but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data of 76 human populations demonstrates that functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in TMPRSS2 gene, was found in many human populations in relatively high frequency, featuring region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by the rs12329760, which previously was found to be associated with prostate cancer, is ranged between 10% and 63% being significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared to European populations. In addition to SNPs, two copy numbers variants (CNV) were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. Number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) and Curcumin. Thus TMPRSS2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2, its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, and expression regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomics properties characterize this gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.","Zarubin, A.; Stepanov, V.; Markov, A.; Kolesnikov, N.; Marusin, A.; Khitrinskaya, I.; Swarovskaya, M.; Litvinov, S.; Ekomasova, N.; Dzhaubermezov, M.; Maksimova, N.; Sukhomyasova, A.; Shtygasheva, O.; Khusnutdinova, E.; Radjabov, M.; Kharkov, V.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.156224v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.156224v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False

Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal.

Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide consistent results. We use several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. Our results suggest that inferences on the origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on rooted trees should be interpreted with caution.","Pipes, L.; Wang, H.; Huelsenbeck, J.; Nielsen, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.160630v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.160630v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False

The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >8 million people worldwide with >2 million cases in the US (June 17th, 2020). There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise, an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-going.

549,The D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhances viral infectivity and decreases neutralization sensitivity to individual convalescent sera,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spike (S) protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is a major target for vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, insights into its sequence variations are key to understanding the infection and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A dominant mutational variant at position 614 of the S protein (aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation) was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence obtained from the Nextstrain database. Using a pseudovirus-based assay, we identified that S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudotyped viruses share a common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could be blocked by recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. However, S-D614 and S-G614 protein demonstrated functional differences. First, S-G614 protein could be cleaved by serine protease elastase-2 more efficiently. Second, S-G614 pseudovirus infected 293T-ACE2 cells significantly more efficiently than did the S-D614 pseudovirus, especially in the presence of elastase-2. Third, an elastase inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus infection. Moreover, 93% (65/70) convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19 could neutralize both S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies, but about 7% (5/70) convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against the S-G614 pseudovirus.

550,Transcriptional response of signalling pathways to SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal human bronchial epithelial cells,"SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19 disease, emerged in Wuhan region in China in 2019, infected more than 4M people and is responsible for death of at least 300K patients globally as of May 2020. Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible.

In this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NF{kappa}B, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NF{kappa}B pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.","Ak, E.; Pir, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163006v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.163006v1?rss=1,2020-06-20,2020-06-20,,False

552,The enzymatic activity of the nsp14 exoribonuclease is critical for replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.

IO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWThe bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","S.

554,"Multi-Omics and Integrated Network Approach to Unveil Evolutionary Patterns, Mutational Hotspots, Functional Crosstalk and Regulatory Interactions in SARS-CoV-2","SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome resulting in infections and death of millions worldwide with maximum cases and mortality in USA. The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types. The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in 238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L & Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking study highlighted mutation (D7611G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor which may contribute to its high transmissibility in USA strains. In addition, we found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B & MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral hub proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike & Membrane). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO-5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network were found to be highly associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the patients. We also considered the presence of CpG islands in Nsp1 and N proteins which may confers the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger methyltransferase activity inside host cell.","Gupta, V.; Haider, S.; Verma, M.; Ponnusamy, K.; Malik, M.

555,ARDS and Cytokine Storm in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Caribbean Vervets,"SARS-CoV-2 induces a wide range of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic infection, to a life-threating illness, particularly in the elderly and persons with comorbid conditions. Up to now, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than five million and led to more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS is difficult to treat clinically, and new therapeutic strategies are needed. In order to evaluate such therapeutic strategies, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed. Here we report fatal ARDS in two African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. Moreover, we report the observation of cytokine release (cytokine storm) in three of four infected AGMs. All four animals showed increased levels of IL-6 in plasma, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest the AGM is a useful model to study disease pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions designed to combat serious pulmonary disease associated with this infection.","Blair, R.

556,Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 phase separates into RNA-rich polymerase-containing condensates,"The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Savastano, A.; Ibanez-de-Opakua, A.; Rankovic, M.; Zweckstetter, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.160648v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.160648v1?rss=1,2020-06-19,2020-06-19,,False

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. Simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.","Gouveia, D.; Miotello, G.; Gallais, F.; Gaillard, J.-C.; Debroas, S.; Bellanger, L.; Lavigne, J.-P.; Sotto, A.; Grenga, L.; Pible, O.; Armengaud, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.161000v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.161000v1?rss=1,2020-06-19,2020-06-19,,False
558,Evaluation of the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological tools and their positioning in COVID-19 diagnostic strategies.,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful outbreak containment. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Additional diagnostic methods enabling the detection of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection would be highly beneficial to ensure the timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Here, we investigated several serological tools, i.e., two immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFA-1 (Biosynex COVID-19 BSS) and LFA-2 (COVID-19 Sign IgM/IgG)) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting IgA (ELISA-1 Euroimmun), IgM (ELISA-2 EDI) and/or IgG (ELISA-1 and ELISA-2) based on well-characterized panels of serum samples from patients and healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients.

559,"Identification of a critical horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 (Mpro, 3CLpro) protease interdomain loop (IDL) of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)","Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.

ImportanceIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","Nick, B.

To identify new candidates we screened a repurposing library of ~3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells found few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validated 23 diverse antiviral drugs. Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity. These antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.","Dittmar, M.; Lee, J.

561,Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 is present in currently available intravenous immunoglobulins,"BackgroundThere is a crucial need for effective therapies that are immediately available to counteract COVID-19 disease. Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.

MethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).

ResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV.

ConclusionIn cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.","Diez, J.

562,Mechanism and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro,"Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode multifunctional proteases that are essential for viral replication and evasion of host innate immune mechanisms. The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.","Klemm, T.; Ebert, G.; Calleja, D.

Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load.

565,Dog Savior: Immediate Scent-Detection of SARS-COV-2 by Trained Dogs,"Molecular tests for viral diagnostics are essential to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, but their production and distribution cannot satisfy the current high demand. Early identification of infected people and their contacts is the key to being able to isolate them and prevent the dissemination of the pathogen; unfortunately, most countries are unable to do this due to the lack of diagnostic tools. Dogs can identify, with a high rate of precision, unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during an infection; as a result, dogs can diagnose infectious agents by smelling specimens and, sometimes, the body of an infected individual. We trained six dogs of three different breeds to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions of infected patients and evaluated their performance experimentally, comparing it against the gold standard (rRT-PCR). Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals. The highest metric was the negative predictive value, indicating that with a disease prevalence of 7.6%, 99.9% of the specimens indicated as negative by the dogs did not carry the virus.

Here, we develop novel severe disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection.

568,Antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters reveals a weak effect of favipiravir and a complete lack of effect for hydroxychloroquine,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the globe after its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019. With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to infect millions of people. To date, close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The high need for treatment options, together with the lack of small animal models of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo evidence attesting their efficacy was available. We used Syrian hamsters to establish a model to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting. Upon intranasal infection, the animals developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and pathology similar to that observed in mild COVID-19 patients. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus. Micro-CT scan analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals, which was confirmed by histopathology. In addition, both compounds did not prevent virus transmission through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments. By modelling the PK profile of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations, we show that the total lung exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor. In conclusion, we here characterized a hamster infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds. The information acquired using hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in this model is of critical value to those designing (current and) future clinical trials. At this point, the data here presented on hydroxychloroquine either alone or combined with azithromycin (together with previously reported in vivo data in macaques and ferrets) provide no scientific basis for further use of the drug in humans.","Kaptein, S.

569,No evidence of coronaviruses or other potentially zoonotic viruses in Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) entering the wildlife trade via Malaysia.,"The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our  upstream market chain samples suggests that these detections in  downstream animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.","Lee, J.; Hughes, T.; Lee, M.-H.; Field, H.; Rovie-Ryan, J. J.; Sitam, F. T.; Sipangkui, S.; Nathan, S. K. S.

570,High-density amplicon sequencing identifies community spread and ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the Southern United States,"SARS-CoV-2 is constantly evolving. Prior studies have focused on high case-density locations, such as the Northern and Western metropolitan areas in the U.S. This study demonstrates continued SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a suburban Southern U.S. region by high-density amplicon sequencing of symptomatic cases. 57% of strains carried the spike D614G variant. The presence of D614G was associated with a higher genome copy number and its prevalence expanded with time. Four strains carried a deletion in a predicted stem loop of the 3 untranslated region. The data are consistent with community spread within the local population and the larger continental U.S. No strain had mutations in the target sites used in common diagnostic assays. The data instill confidence in the sensitivity of current tests and validate ""testing by sequencing"" as a new option to uncover cases, particularly those not conforming to the standard clinical presentation of COVID-19. This study contributes to the understanding of COVID-19 by providing an extensive set of genomes from a non-urban setting and further informs vaccine design by defining D614G as a dominant and emergent SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the U.S.","McNamara, R.

571,An in-silico based clinical insight on the effect of noticeable CD4 conserved residues of SARS-CoV-2 on the CD4-MHC-I interactions,"The study is aimed to unveil the conserved residues of CD4 in the context of its purposeful interaction with MHC-II at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 compared with the envelope (Env) glycoprotein (gp) 120 of HIV-1. The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server.

As per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-13.9 kcal/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (-12.5 kcal/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4. With a noticeable single salt bridge formation identified at the interacting residues Lys305 (of Env gp120-HIV-1) and Glu139 (of MHC-II); the Env gp120 interaction with MHC-II occupied the crucial His144 and Glu194 (salt-bridge) interacting residues of CD4 with the measured buried surface area 2554.8{+/-}40.8 [A]2. Similarly, the RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2-MHC-II complex showed two salt bridge formations at the residue sites: 1) Arg567 (of SARS-CoV-2)-Glu194 (of MHC-II) 2) 2) Asp568(of SARS-CoV-2)-Arg165 (of MHC-II) with the increased buried surface area of 1910.9{+/-}97.1 [A]2 over the SARS-CoV score 1708.2{+/-}50.8 [A]2; that camouflaged all crucial CD4 interacting residues of MHC-II.

572,Multi-pronged human protein mimicry by SARS-CoV-2 reveals bifurcating potential for MHC detection and immune evasion,"The hand of molecular mimicry in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution and immune evasion remains to be deciphered. Here, we identify 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes, including 20 novel peptides not observed in any previous human coronavirus (HCoV) strains. Four of these mimicked 8-mers/9-mers map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This striking mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made more salient by the targeted genes being focally expressed in arteries, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, and macrophages. Further, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases with primary expression of the mimicked human proteins in the neurons and immune cells. These findings highlight molecular mimicry as a shared strategy adopted by evolutionary titans -- the virus in its quest for escaping herd immune surveillance, and the host immune systems that are constantly learning the patterns of ""self"" and ""non-self"".","Venkatakrishnan, A.; Kayal, N.; Anand, P.; Badley, A.

573,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus we demonstrate that, in addition to human ACE2, the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the twenty-two different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat and rabbit were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the three genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle entry was inefficient in cells bearing the ACE2 receptor from bats or birds the live virus was still able to enter these cells, albeit with markedly lower efficiency. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock and wildlife.","Conceicao, C.; Thakur, N.; Human, S.; Kelly, J.

574,"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is dynamic, disordered, and phase separates with RNA","The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant RNA binding protein that plays a variety of roles in the viral life cycle including replication, transcription, and genome packaging. Despite its critical and multifunctional nature, the molecular details that underlie how N protein mediates these functions are poorly understood. Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to the function of SARS-CoV-2 N protein. N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions and two folded domains. All three disordered regions are highly dynamic and contain regions of transient helicity that appear to act as local binding interfaces for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions. The two folded domains do not significantly interact with one another, such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA binding protein. As observed for other proteins with similar molecular features, we found that N protein undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA. Polymer models predict that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We propose a simple model in which symmetry breaking through specific binding sites promotes the formation of metastable single-RNA condensate, as opposed to large multi-RNA phase separated droplets. We speculate that RNA compaction to form dynamic single-genome condensates may underlie the early stages of genome packaging. As such, assays that measure how compounds modulate phase separation could provide a convenient tool for identifying drugs that disrupt viral packaging.","Cubuk, J.; Alston, J. J.; Incicco, J.

Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 1 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging RBD and NTD revealed recognition of the closed, ""all RBD-down"" conformation of the spike.

Here we investigated the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase (late February to late April) of the epidemic in Brazil. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and the community transmission of a major B.1.1 lineage defined by two amino acid substitutions in the Nucleocapsid and ORF6. This SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineage was probably established during February 2020 and rapidly spread through the country, reaching different Brazilian regions by the middle of March 2020.

577,Saliva-Based Molecular Testing for SARS-CoV-2 that Bypasses RNA Extraction,"Convenient, repeatable, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 would be a key weapon to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA isolation/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple, utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.

580,Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib as a potential drug for COVID-19,"The rapid geographic expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, poses an immediate need for potent drugs that can help contain the outbreak. Enveloped viruses infect the host cell by cellular membrane fusion, a crucial mechanism required for virus replication. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, due to its primary interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptor, is considered as a potential target for drug development. Based on in silico screening followed by in vitro studies, here we report that the existing FDA-approved Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 130 nM. We provide initial evidence that inhibition of virus fusion may explain the antiviral action of imatinib. This finding is significant since pinpointing the mode of action allows evaluating the drugs affinity to the SARS-CoV-2-specific target protein, and in turn, helps make inferences on the potency of the drug and evidence-based recommendations on its dosage. To this end, we provide evidence that imatinib binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with an affinity at micromolar, i.e., 2.32 {+/-} 0.9 {micro}M, levels. We also show that imatinib inhibits other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, possibly via fusion inhibition.

Conservation of these antigens among viral strains is critical to ensure optimum diagnostic test performance and broad protective efficacy, respectively. We assessed N and S antigen diversity from 17,853 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluated selection pressure. Up to 6-7 incipient phylogenetic clades were identified for both antigens, confirming early variants of the S antigen and identifying new ones. Significant diversifying selection was detected at multiple sites for both antigens. Some sequence variants have already spread in multiple regions, in spite of their low frequency.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 3a forms large conductance cation channels and present cryo-EM structures of dimeric and tetrameric 3a in lipid nanodiscs. 3a adopts a novel fold and is captured in a closed or inactivated state. A narrow bifurcated exterior pore precludes conduction and leads to a large polar cavity open to the cytosol. 3a function is conserved in a common variant among circulating SARS-CoV-2 that alters the channel pore. We identify 3a-like proteins in all Alpha- and Beta-coronaviruses that infect bats and humans, suggesting therapeutics targeting 3a could treat a range of coronaviral diseases.","Kern, D.

585,Early temporal dynamics of cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have evolved proteins that can inhibit host antiviral responses, likely contributing to disease progression and high case-fatality rates. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 resulting in a global pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to induce a robust type I interferon (IFN) response in human cells, leading to speculation about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit innate antiviral responses. However, innate antiviral responses are dynamic in nature and gene expression levels rapidly change within minutes to hours. In this study, we have performed a time series RNA-seq and selective immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung (Calu-3) cells to characterize early virus-host processes. SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated transcripts for type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) after 12 hours. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit type I IFN production and downstream antiviral signaling in human cells. Using exogenous stimuli, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to modulate IFN{beta} production and downstream expression of ISGs, such as IRF7 and IFIT1. Thus, data from our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved additional mechanisms, such as masking of viral nucleic acid sensing by host cells to mount a dampened innate antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully identify the range of immune-modulatory strategies of SARS-CoV-2.

SignificanceHighly pathogenic coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS have evolved proteins to shutdown antiviral responses. The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with its relatively low case-fatality rate have led to speculation about its ability to modulate antiviral responses. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to block antiviral responses that are mounted by exogenous stimuli. Data from our study provide promising support for the use of recombinant type I IFN as combination therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our data also suggest that the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to efficiently modulate antiviral responses may be associated with its low case-fatality rate compared to other pathogenic CoVs that cause SARS and MERS.","Banerjee, A.; Budylowski, P.; Richard, D.; Maan, H.; Aguiar, J.; El-Sayes, N.; D'Agostino, M.

586,"A thermostable, closed, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer.","The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates receptor binding and cell entry and is the dominant target of the immune system. S exhibits substantial conformational flexibility. It transitions from closed to open conformations to expose its receptor binding site, and subsequently from prefusion to postfusion conformations to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. S protein derivatives are components of vaccine candidates and diagnostic assays, as well as tools for research into the biology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2. Here we have designed mutations in S which allow production of thermostable, crosslinked, S protein trimers that are trapped in the closed, pre-fusion, state. We have determined the structures of crosslinked and non-crosslinked proteins, identifying two distinct closed conformations of the S trimer. We demonstrate that the designed, thermostable, closed S trimer can be used in serological assays. This protein has potential applications as a reagent for serology, virology and as an immunogen.","Xiong, X.; Qu, K.; Ciazynska, K. A.; Hosmillo, M.; Carter, A. P.; Ebrahimi, S.; Ke, Z.; Scheres, S.

To simplify testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the CDC, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the singleplex assay adapted for research purposes. Low copies (>500 copies / reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR.

We next developed a sequence alignment free method that extensively searches for advantageous mutations and rank them in an increase level for their intrapopulation frequency. Time-series analysis of occurrences of oligonucleotides of diverse lengths for SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed seven distinctive mutations that rapidly expanded their intrapopulation frequency and are thought to be candidates of advantageous mutations for the efficient growth in human cells.","Wada, K.; Wada, Y.; Ikemura, T.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282v1?rss=1,2020-06-17,2020-06-17,,False
591,Deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain reveals constraints on folding and ACE2 binding,"The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to ACE2 receptor, and is a major determinant of host range and a dominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we experimentally measure how all amino-acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBDs surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses. However, we find no evidence that these ACE2-affinity enhancing mutations have been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates.

592,Pervasive RNA secondary structure in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses - an endeavour to understand its biological purpose,"The ultimate outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown and is dependent on a complex interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility and population immunity. In the current study, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses - even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base-paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed substantially less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus which is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterised, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represent important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.","Simmonds, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.155200v1?rss=1,2020-06-17,2020-06-17,,False

Recently, crystallographic fragment screening uncovered a large number of molecules binding at the Mpro active site as well as at sites of potential allostery. However, no information on fragment affinity is available. Here, we describe an efficient protocol for screening chemical compounds for binding to Mpro using saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy. We characterised the relative affinity of Mpro-binding fragments using STD-NMR, revealing a ~200-fold difference in binding potential. Combined with crystallographic structures of these fragments bound to Mpro, this information can assist ongoing drug design efforts.","Kantsadi, A.

Here we report the crystal structure of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 bound to a previously identified Chinese herb inhibitor shikonin at 2.45 angstrom resolution. Although the structure revealed here shares similar overall structure with other published structures, there are several key differences which highlight potential features that could be exploited. The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 undergoes dramatic conformational changes, and the structure reveals an unusual arrangement of oxyanion loop stabilized by the substrate. Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding. As we learn more about different binding modes and their structure-function relationships, it is probable that we can design more effective and specific drugs with high potency that can serve as effect SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral agents.","Li, J.; Zhou, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, F.; Lin, C.; McCormick, P.

We investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs.

We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT, which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating reads had no effect on the downstream analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to survive on inanimate surfaces for several days, yet the factors that determine its survival on surfaces are not well understood. Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for human respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Although saliva microdroplets dried out rapidly at all tested RH levels (unlike SM that remained hydrated at RH [&ge;] 57%), survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly higher than in water or SM. Thus, RH and hydration conditions are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely affect physicochemical properties that determine virus survival. The observed high virus survival in dry saliva deposited on surfaces, under a wide range of RH levels, can have profound implications for human public health, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fedorenko, A.; Grinberg, M.; Orevi, T.; Kashtan, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152983v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152983v1?rss=1,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,,False
