0,Highly potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin therapeutic candidates,"Globally accessible preventive and therapeutic molecules against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. DARPin molecules are an emerging class of novel therapeutics based on naturally occurring repeat proteins (about 15 kDa in size) and can be rapidly produced in bacteria in large quantities. Here, we report the identification of 380 DARPin molecules specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein selected from a naive library of 10^12 DARPin molecules. Using extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization, (pseudo)virus neutralization assays and cryo EM analysis, 11 mono-DARPin molecules targeting either the receptor binding domain (RBD), the S1 N-terminal-domain (NTD) or the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were chosen. Based on these 11 mono-DARPin molecules, 31 anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin molecules were constructed which can broadly be grouped into 2 types; multi-paratopic RBD-neutralizing DARPin molecules and multi-mode DARPin molecules targeting simultaneously RBD, NTD and the S2 domain. Each of these multi-DARPin molecules acts by binding with 3 DARPin modules to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, leading to potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection down to 1 ng/ml (12 pM) and potentially providing protection against viral escape mutations. Additionally, 2 DARPin modules binding serum albumin, conferring an expected half-life of about 3 weeks in humans, were included in the multi-DARPin molecules. The protective efficacy of one multi-DARPin molecule was studied in a Golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model, resulting in a significant reduction in viral load and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the multi-DARPin molecules reported here display very high antiviral potency, high-production yield, and a long systemic half-life, and thereby have the potential for single-dose use for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Walser, M.; Rothenberger, S.; Hurdiss, D.

1,Global and Local Mutations in Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 Genomes,"COVID-19 warrants comprehensive investigations of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to gain new insight about their epidemiology, mutations and pathogenesis. In this study, we compared 207 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh and their comparison with 467 globally reported sequences to understand the origin of viruses, patterns of mutations, and their apparent impact on pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that GR clade is predominant in Bangladesh and SARS-CoV-2 viruses might have arrived through infected travellers from European countries. We found 2602 mutations including 1602 missense mutations, 612 synonymous mutations, 36 insertions and deletions. In line with the global trend, D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein was predominantly high (95.6%) in Bangladeshi isolates. Previously reported frequent mutations such as P4715L, D614G, R203K, G204R and I300F were also prevalent. Additionally, 87 unique amino acid changes were revealed. The analyses would increase our understanding of variations in virus genomes circulating in Bangladesh and elsewhere.","Hasan, M. M.; Das, R.; Rasheduzzaman, M.; Hussain, M. H.; Muzahid, N.

2,Inhibiting coronavirus replication in cultured cells by chemical ER stress,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens for which no specific treatment is available. Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be exploited to suppress CoV replication. We found that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types, (partially) restores the virus-induced translational shut-down, and counteracts the CoV-mediated downregulation of IRE1 and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide data sets revealed specific pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral state, including HERPUD1, an essential factor of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein degradation complexes. The data show that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism required for CoV replication, suggesting that thapsigargin (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs.","Shaban, M.

3,MMGB/SA Consensus Estimate of the Binding Free Energy Between the Novel Coronavirus Spike Protein to the Human ACE2 Receptor,"The ability to estimate protein-protein binding free energy in a computationally efficient via a physics-based approach is beneficial to research focused on the mechanism of viruses binding to their target proteins. Implicit solvation methodology may be particularly useful in the early stages of such research, as it can offer valuable insights into the binding process, quickly. Here we evaluate the potential of the related molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB/SA) approach to estimate the binding free energy {Delta}Gbind between the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the human ACE2 receptor. The calculations are based on a recent flavor of the generalized Born model, GBNSR6. Two estimates of {Delta}Gbind are performed: one based on standard bondi radii, and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. We take the average of the resulting two {Delta}Gbind values as the consensus estimate. For the well-studied Ras-Raf protein-protein complex, which has similar binding free energy to that of the SARS- CoV-2/ACE2 complex, the consensus {Delta}Gbind = -11.8 {+/-} 1 kcal/mol, vs. experimental -9.7 {+/-} 0.2 kcal/mol. The consensus estimates for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex is {Delta}Gbind = -9.4 {+/-} 1.5 kcal/mol, which is in near quantitative agreement with experiment (-10.6 kcal/mol). The availability of a conceptually simple MMGB/SA-based protocol for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 /ACE2 binding may be beneficial in light of the need to move forward fast.","Forouzesh, N.; Onufriev, A.

4,Anxiety and media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait,"Background: Rising fear and panic among public during COVID19 pandemic increase concern regarding anxiety cases in Kuwait. Media capture our attention during this period looking for daily virus update lead to more fear . Our purpose of this study to examine the relationship between anxiety and media exposure among Kuwaiti during COVID19 outbreak Method: cross sectional study among Kuwaiti citizen between age23-55yrs old was conducted from April,21,2020 to May,15,2020 using online survey. Total of 1230 participants involve in the current study after exclusion criteria removed. Beside demographic data and media exposure anxiety was assessed using generalized anxiety disorder scale GAD-7. multivariable regression was used to identify the correlation between anxiety and media exposure Result: the result show that there is positive correlation between media exposure and anxiety during COVID19 outbreak in Kuwait (p<.001), furthermore it revealed that there is significant relationship between the frequency of exposure and anxiety(<.001) Conclusion: from this study we can understand that during COVID19 pandemic exposure to media can cause anxiety therefore measures should be taken by the governments to fight misinformation and physician should pay more attention to mental health disease during this period.","alasousi, l. f.; alhammouri, s.; alabdulhadi, s.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180745v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180745v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True
5,Perceptions of Risk of Attending Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a UK public opinion survey,"In order to inform clinical and research practice in secondary care in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online survey was used to collect public opinions on attending hospitals. The survey link was circulated via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Involvement (PPI) Leads network and social media. 402 people completed the survey. Participants age ranged from the 18-85+, with the majority (337 (84%)) aged between 35 to 74 years. There were a higher number of women (77%) compared to men (23%); and were mainly White European (91%) compared to BAME (6%), or other (2%). Data collection included self-identified risk status due to comorbidity or age, and 100 point Likert-type scales to measures feelings of safety, factors affecting feelings of safety, intention to participate in research, comfort with new ways of working and attitudes to research. Results for feelings of safety scales indicate two distinct groups; one of respondents who felt quite safe and one of those who did not. Implementation of COVID-19 related safety measures such as social distancing, use of PPE and cleaning were strongly supported by most respondents. There was ambivalence around less certain measures such as regular staff antigen and antibody testing. Respondents were most likely to participate in research related to their own condition, COVID-19 research and vaccine research, but less likely to participate in healthy volunteer research, especially if suffering from a pre-existing comorbidity identified with increased risk or were female. There was general agreement that participants are comfortable with new ways of working, such as remote consultation, though women and BAME respondents were less comfortable. Findings raise concerns for health inequalities already impacting some groups in the pandemic. The role of clinical necessity and personal benefit support the reopening of services in line with clinical necessity. Moderate caution in respect of vaccine research relative to patient-participant research presents a challenge for pending recruitment demands, and would benefit from qualitative research to explore themes and concerns in more depth and support development and targeting of key messaging.","Pritchard, R.; Brady, E.; Chudasama, Y.; Davies, M.; McCann, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180836v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180836v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True
6,Chest X-ray image analysis and classification for COVID-19 pneumonia detection using Deep CNN,"In order to speed up the discovery of COVID-19 disease mechanisms, this research developed a new diagnosis platform using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to assist radiologists with diagnosis by distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from non-COVID-19 pneumonia in patients at Middlemore Hospital based on chest X-rays classification and analysis. Such a tool can save time in interpreting chest X-rays and increase the accuracy and thereby enhance our medical capacity for detection and diagnosis COVID-19. The idea is that a set of X-ray medical lung images (which include normal, infected by bacteria, infected by virus including COVID-19) were used to train a deep CNN which can be able to distinguish between the noise and the useful information and then uses this training to interpret new images by recognizing patterns that indicate certain diseases such as coronavirus infection in the individual images. The supervised learning method is used as the process of learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a doctor supervising the learning process. It becomes more accurate as the number of analyzed images growing. In this way, it imitates the training for a doctor, but the theory is that since it is capable of learning from a far larger set of images than any human, can have the potential of being more accurate.","Gao, T.; Wang, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True
7,"Mutational landscape and dominant lineages in the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the state of Telangana, India","The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has rapidly turned into a pandemic, infecting millions and causing ~7 million deaths across the globe. In addition to studying the mode of transmission and evasion of host immune system, analysing the viral mutational landscape constitutes an area under active research. The latter is expected to impart knowledge on the emergence of different clades, subclades, viral protein functions and protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions during replication/transcription cycle of virus and response to host immune checkpoints.

8,Multi-species ELISA for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in animals,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with millions of infected humans and hundreds of thousands of fatalities. As the novel disease - referred to as COVID-19 - unfolded, occasional anthropozoonotic infections of animals by owners or caretakers were reported in dogs, felid species and farmed mink. Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions. The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV 2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31% was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated. Hence, a versatile and reliable ELISA protocol was established that enables high-throughput antibody detection in a broad range of animal species, which may be used for outbreak investigations, to assess the seroprevalence in susceptible species or to screen for reservoir or intermediate hosts.","Wernike, K.; Aebischer, A.; Michelitsch, A.; Hoffmann, D.; Freuling, C.; Balkema-Buschmann, A.; Graaf, A.; Mueller, T.; Osterrieder, N.; Rissmann, M.; Rubbenstroth, D.; Schoen, J.; Schulz, C.; Trimpert, J.; Ulrich, L.; Volz, A.; Mettenleiter, T.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.266825v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.266825v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,False
9,A unique view of SARS-CoV-2 through the lens of ORF8 protein,"Immune evasion is one of the unique characteristics of COVID-19 attributed to the ORF8 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This protein is involved in modulating the host adaptive immunity through down-regulating MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules and innate immune responses by surpassing the interferon mediated antiviral response of the host. To understand the immune perspective of the host with respect to the ORF8 protein, a comprehensive study of the ORF8 protein as well as mutations possessed by it, is performed. Chemical and structural properties of ORF8 proteins from different hosts, that is human, bat and pangolin, suggests that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13-CoV are very much closer related than that of Pangolin-CoV. Eighty-seven mutations across unique variants of ORF8 (SARS-CoV-2) are grouped into four classes based on their predicted effects. Based on geo- locations and timescale of collection, a possible flow of mutations was built. Furthermore, conclusive flows of amalgamation of mutations were endorsed upon sequence similarity and amino acid conservation phylogenies. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the uniqueness of rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 through the ORF8.","Hassan, S. S.; Ghosh, S.; Attrish, D.; Choudhury, P.

10,Furin Cleavage Site Is Key to SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,"SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world. Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.","Johnson, B. A.; Xie, X.; Kalveram, B.; Lokugamage, K.

11,Molecular dynamics reveals complex compensatory effects of ionic strength on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/hACE-2 interaction,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already killed more than 800,000 people worldwide. To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of spike RBD/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.","Souza, A. S. d.; Rivera, J.

12,Serum lipid profile changes and their clinical diagnostic significance in COVID-19 Mexican Patients,"Background: COVID-19 has been recognized as an emerging and rapidly evolving health condition. For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections. Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility. Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.","Osuna-Ramos, J.

13,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G increases entry fitness across a range of ACE2 levels, directly outcompetes the wild type, and is preferentially incorporated into trimers","Early in the current pandemic, the D614G mutation arose in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and quickly became the dominant variant globally. Mounting evidence suggests D614G enhances viral entry. Here we use a direct competition assay with single-cycle viruses to show that D614G outcompetes the wildtype. We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers. Our findings suggest that D614G increases infection of cells expressing a wide range of ACE2, and informs the mechanism underlying enhanced entry.

16,AI aided design of epitope-based vaccine for the induction of cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2,"The heavy burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our society triggered the race towards the development of therapies or preventive strategies. Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes. Next, the results of our approach were compared with other vaccine-design strategies reported in the literature. The risk of immuno-toxicity was also assessed. The analysis of epitope conservation among other Coronaviridae was carried out in order to facilitate the selection of peptides shared across different SARS-CoV-2 strains and which might be conserved in emerging zootic coronavirus strains. Finally, the potential applicability of the selected epitopes for the development of a vaccine eliciting cellular immunity for COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of such an approach.","Mazzocco, G.; Niemiec, I.; Myronov, A.; Skoczylas, P.; Kaczmarczyk, J.; Sanecka-Duin, A.; Gruba, K.; Krol, P.; Drwal, M.; Szczepanik, M.; Pyrc, K.; Stepniak, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267997v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267997v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,False
17,Clinical Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 on Therapeutic Anticoagulants,"Background: COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and an increased incidence of thrombosis. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who either continued therapeutic anticoagulants previously prescribed or who were newly started on anticoagulants during hospitalization. Methods: We performed an observational study of adult inpatients with COVID-19 at 10 hospitals affiliated with Northwestern Medicine in the Chicagoland area from March 9 to June 26, 2020. We evaluated clinical outcomes of subjects with COVID-19 who were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization and those who were newly started on these medications compared to those who were on prophylactic doses of these medications based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. The primary outcome was overall death while secondary outcomes were critical illness (WHO score >5), need for mechanical ventilation, and death among those subjects who first had critical illness adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score, glucose on admission, and use of antiplatelet agents. Results: 1,716 subjects with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. 171 subjects (10.0%) were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation and 201(11.7%) were started on new therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization. In subjects continued on home therapeutic anticoagulation, there were no differences in overall death, critical illness, mechanical ventilation, or death among subjects with critical illness compared to subjects on prophylactic anticoagulation. Subjects receiving new therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 were more likely to die (OR 5.93; 95% CI 3.71-9.47), have critical illness (OR 14.51; 95% CI 7.43-28.31), need mechanical ventilation (OR 11.22; 95% CI 6.67-18.86), and die after first having critical illness. (OR 5.51; 95% CI 2.80 -10.87). Conclusions: Continuation of outpatient prescribed anticoagulant was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. Therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 in absence of other indications was associated with worse clinical outcomes.","Patel, N. G.; Bhasin, A.; Feinglass, J. M.; Belknap, S. M.; Angarone, M.

18,Convalescent Plasma in treatment of COVID-19: A review of evidence for a living systematic benefit-risk assessment,"Objectives: We aimed to review the evidence for a living systematic benefit risk assessment for convalescent plasma use amongst patients with severe COVID-19 disease, based on currently available data. Methods: The assessment used the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. Convalescent plasma treatment in severe COVID-19 was compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted to identify published papers from January 1st, 2019 until July 8th, 2020. A value tree was constructed which included ranked key benefits and risks. Results: We screened 396 papers from PubMed and 127 papers from Embase. Four studies were eligible for inclusion as they contained comparative data. Results from a randomised controlled trial revealed a non-statistically significant shortening of time to clinical improvement of 2.15 days (95% CI, -5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a possible signal of increased efficacy amongst a small subset of patients with severe disease (but not life threatening disease), however this study may have been underpowered. Interpretation of findings amongst the three controlled non-randomised studies were limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomisation, and confounding by co-administration of other treatments. Limited data availability at the current time precluded construction of a data summary table and further quantitative analysis. Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from controlled studies to complete a data summary table for a systematic benefit-risk assessment of the use of CP for severe COVID-19 disease at the current time, and as such a benefit-risk conclusion could not be made. Whilst uncontrolled case series have suggested positive findings with CP, results from these studies are very difficult to interpret. We provide a framework which can be updated when further data that have an impact on the benefit-risk become available.","Davies, M.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Denyer, J.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Osborne, V.; Shakir, S.

19,UK prevalence of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: a point prevalence study using electronic health records,"Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years. Interpretation The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (aged [&ge;]70 years, or with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals.","Walker, J.

21,The Effect of Area Deprivation on COVID-19 Risk in Louisiana,"Purpose: Louisiana currently has the highest per capita case count for COVID-19 in the United States and disproportionately affects the Black or African American population. Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","KC, M.; Oral, E.; Straif-Bourgeois, S.; Rung, A.

22,"Sociodemographic disparities in knowledge, practices, and ability to comply with COVID-19 public health measures in Canada","The effectiveness of public health interventions for mitigation of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic depends on individual attitudes and the level of compliance toward these measures. We surveyed a representative sample of the Canadian population about risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards the Canadian COVID-19 public health response. Our analysis demonstrates that these risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours varied by several demographic variables identifying a number of areas in which policies could help address issues of public adherence. Examples include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate but may not have the means to do so, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school reopening policies. Taken together such measures are likely to mitigate the impact of the next pandemic wave in Canada.","Brankston, G.; Merkley, E.; Fisman, D. N.; Tuite, A. R.; Poljak, Z.; Loewen, P. J.; Greer, A.

23,SARS-CoV-2 phylodynamics differentiates the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"Quantifying the effectiveness of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 is critical to adapting responses against future waves of the pandemic. By combining phylogenetic data of 5,198 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with the chronology of non-pharmaceutical interventions in 57 countries, we examine how interventions and combinations thereof alter the divergence rate of viral lineages, which is directly related to the epidemic reproduction number. Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required. Our phylodynamic approach can complement epidemiological models to inform public health strategies against COVID-19.","Rasigade, J.-P.; Barray, A.; Shapiro, J.

24,Stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19: A multinational survey from six Asian regions,"People may experience a heightened level of stress reactions during a pandemic event and in an isolated social environment. A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.","Yue, R. P. H.; Cheng, E. W.; Or, N. H. K.; Yuen, S. W.

25,Monitoring COVID-19 related public Interest and population Health Literacy in South Asia: An Internet Search-Interest Based Model,"Background Information epidemiology based on internet search data can be used to model COVID-19 pandemic progressions and monitor population health literacy. However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.","Symum, H.; Ali, K.

26,Mortality from COVID in Colombia and Peru: Analyses of Mortality Data and Statistical Forecasts,"National predictions of the course of COVID mortality can be used to plan for effective healthcare responses as well as to support COVID policymaking. We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48%-92% over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7%-55% over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13% excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34% excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.","Brown, P.

27,Pooling of samples to optimize SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR: comparative analysis of two protocols.,"RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the main diagnostic test used to identify the novel coronavirus. Several countries have used large scale SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing as one of the important strategies for combating the pandemic. In order to process the massive needs for coronavirus testing, the usual throughput of routine clinical laboratories has reached and often surpassed its limits and new approaches to cope with this challenge must be developed. This study has aimed to evaluate the use pool of samples as a strategy to optimize the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in a general population. A total of 220 naso/orofaryngeal swab samples were collected and tested using two different protocols of sample pooling. In the first protocol (Protocol A); 10 clinical samples were pooled before RNA extraction. The second protocol (Protocol B) consisted of pooling the already extracted RNAs from 10 individual samples. Results from Protocol A were identical (100% agreement) with the individual results. However, for results from Protocol B, reduced agreement (91%) was observed in relation to results obtained by individual testing. Inconsistencies observed were related to RT-qPCR results with higher Cycle Thresholds (Ct > 32.73). Furthermore, in pools containing more than one positive individual, the Ct of the pool was equivalent to the lowest Ct among the individual results. These results provide additional evidence in favor of the clinical use of pooled samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR and suggest that pooling of samples before RNA extraction is preferrable in terms of diagnostic yield.","Volpato, F.; Lima-Morales, D.; Wink, P.

29,Parameter Estimation of COVID-19 Pandemic Model with Self Protection Behavior Changes,"A mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is proposed by incorporating self-protection behavior changes in the population. The disease-free equilibrium point is computed and its stability analysis is studied. The basic reproduction number(R 0 ) of the model is computed and the disease-free equilibrium point is locally and globally stable for R 0<1 and unstable for R 0 >1. Based on the available data the unknown model parameters are estimated using a combination of least square and Bayesian estimation methods for different countries. Using forward sensitivity index the model parameters are carried out to determine and identify the key factors for the spread of disease dynamics. From country to country the sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus varies. It is found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment. It is also demonstrated that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Numerical simulations also show that the virus transmission dynamics depend mostly on those sensitive parameters.","Mekonen, K. G.; Habtemicheal, T. G.; Balcha, S.

30,In-house assembled protective devices in laboratory safety against SARS-nCoV-2 in clinical biochemistry laboratory of a COVID dedicated hospital,"Background: Health Care Workers (HCWs) of diagnostic laboratory handling COVID positive samples are at risk and need to take protective measures. Many protective materials were not available when the pandemic reached India forcing laboratory managers to take innovative measures to protect the laboratory staffs. Methods: We made face shields from OHP sheets and substitute of biosafety cabinets from cardboard boxes fitted with hypochlorite spraying devices. Here we present if these two in-house developed safety devices when incorporated in standard operating procedure (SOP) of laboratory safety were effective in clinical biochemistry laboratory of dedicated COVID hospitals. Results: We assessed contamination of laboratory surfaces (n=6) and rate of SARS-nCov-2 positivity from their nasal and throat swab by RT-PCR among laboratory personnel (n=18) after 14 days of their use along with other routine safety devices like use of gloves, surgical masks, OT gowns etc. These HCWs were checked regularly for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and none had any signs and symptoms during these 14days. The SARS-nCov-2 test report was negative for the staff members and no surface contamination was detected. We conclude that innovative and cost effective protective devices can be built in-house with locally available resources and are effective in preventing the spread of COVID 19 among the staff working in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Conclusions: Laboratory managers in resource scarce areas need to be innovative to face such sudden safety challenges like COVID-19 pandemic.","Dubey, A.; Bansal, A.; Sonkar, S.

31,Preventing disease after exposure to COVID-19 using hydroxychloroquine: A summary of a protocol for exploratory re-analysis of age and time-nuanced effects.,"BACKGROUND: A recently published randomized trial (Boulware et al., 2020, NCT04308668) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis found a reduction in Covid-19 of 17%. In the context of ambitious powering to detect a 50% reduction, this non-statistically significant finding could translate to a reduction of 22,000/130,828 cases (CDC 8/12/20) among US health care workers (HCW), impacting trajectory and resource utilization models that drive decisions on lockdowns and social distancing. Data found only in the appendix of Boulware et al. suggested greater differences in the effect of HCQ among sub-groups. There were reductions (36%) in younger (<35 years) and increases (110%) in older (>50 years) subjects. Our preliminary analysis revealed a significant negative correlation (slope -0.211, CI -0.328-0.094, p=0.016) between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when initiated within one day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). There were also differences in disease reduction by HCQ by type of exposure (HCW - 8% vs. household contacts - 31%; RR 0.691, CI 0.398-1.2). The definitions of exposure severity did not discriminate between the numbers or duration (> 10 minutes) of exposures. Differences between exposure types may result from younger HCW and higher risks in less trained household contacts with little access to advanced PPE. The ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid were likely confounders, as was the possibly active folate placebo. Exploratory reanalysis of the raw dataset may inform an age- and stage- nuanced approach to COVID-19 using HCQ testable by prospective studies and may provide insight into the various proposed mechanisms of HCQ. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an exploratory re-analysis of the de-identified raw dataset from a randomized study of the use of HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 with view to further defining: a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, b) The age dependent effect of HCQ; c) The sub-stratification of time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. d) The design of future clinical trials to test the hypotheses generated by this study. METHODS: Should granularity of data (by age, time-lag, level and type of exposure) be greater than that originally reported, Fisher Exact test will be used to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in HCQ- and control groups, for each sub-group stratification. Since the degree of loss of data granularity due to de-identification is yet unknown, exploratory analyses involving other demographic characteristics cannot be planned. Where sufficient data granularity exists, univariate regression analyses will be conducted to examine the effect of age- and time lag on any effect of HCQ. The possibility will be explored of conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching to examine observational data relating to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. This analysis will be expanded should a dataset from a similarly designed study (Mitja et al., 2020, NCT04304053), with directionally similar results, become available.

32,Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 45 countries,"The number of COVID-19 deaths is often used as a key indicator of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic size. 42 However, heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and variable reporting of deaths in elderly 43 individuals can hamper comparisons of deaths and the number of infections associated with them 44 across countries. Using age-specific death data from 45 countries, we find that relative differences 45 in the number of deaths by age amongst individuals aged <65 years old are highly consistent across 46 locations. Combining these data with data from 15 seroprevalence surveys we demonstrate how 47 age-specific infection fatality ratios (IFRs) can be used to reconstruct infected population 48 proportions. We find notable heterogeneity in overall IFR estimates as suggested by individual 49 serological studies and observe that for most European countries the reported number of deaths 50 amongst [&ge;]65s are significantly greater than expected, consistent with high infection attack rates 51 experienced by nursing home populations in Europe. Age-specific COVID-19 death data in 52 younger individuals can provide a robust indicator of population immunity.","O'Driscoll, M.; Ribeiro Dos Santos, G.; Wang, L.; Cummings, D. A. T.; Azman, A.

33,Assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in an intense re-exposure setting,"Background: Reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a subject of debate. We aimed to assess the risk and incidence rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a large cohort of laboratory-confirmed cases in Qatar. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is [&ge;]45 days after a first positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak/no evidence for reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab [&ge;]45 days after the first positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) were diagnosed at a health facility suggesting presence of symptoms, while 31 (57.4%) were identified incidentally through random testing campaigns/surveys or contact tracing. Only one person was hospitalized at or following time of reinfection swab, but still had relatively mild infection. No deaths were recorded. Risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.04% (95% CI: 0.03-0.05%) and incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 1.09 (95% CI: 0.84-1.42) per 10,000 person-weeks. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection appears to be a rare phenomenon suggestive of a strong protective immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least a few months post primary infection.","Abu-Raddad, L.

Methods: Statistical examination of the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 353 patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease admitted from February to April 2020. Result: Minor discrepancies were observed in the clinical presentations, radiologic involvement and laboratory results across groups of patients under treatment with specific drugs. Aspirin-users had better clinical outcome with lower need of ventilation support, whereas, metformin-users had increased chance of intubation and of mortality.

35,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients without clinical signs of cardiac involvement,"Background - Cardiovascular complication in patients affected by novel Coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) are increasingly recognized. However, although a cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for inflammatory cells in autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients has been reported, the presence of the virus in cardiomyocytes has not been documented yet. Methods - We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA. Conclusions - In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.","Bulfamante, G.

37,"COVID-19: Estimation of the Actual Onset of Local Epidemic Cycles, Determination of Total Number of Infective, and Duration of the Incubation Period","Background: Most studies of the epidemic cycles of the pandemic of Sars-CoV-2, or COVID-19 as it became known, define the beginning of specific cycles in countries from the laboratory identification of the first cases of infection, however, there is the awareness that cycles may have started earlier, without proper identification. This influences all the parameters that govern the statistical models used for controlling the infection. Purpose: This work proposes two models based on experimental data. The Logistic Model it is used to obtain three parameters of the epidemic cycle of COVID-19, namely: the final count for the total infected, the daily infection rate and the lag time. Complimentary, a novel inventory model is proposed to calculate the number of infective persons, as well as to determine the incubation period. Methods: The data on epidemic cycles of Germany, Italy, and Sweden are treated previously by the Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI), then a variation of the Logistic Model, obtained through curve-fitting, is used to obtain the three parameters. The inventory model is introduced to calculate the actual number of infected persons and the behavior of the incubation period is analyzed. Results: After comparing data from the three countries it is possible to determine the actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles for each one, determine the size of the incubation period, as well as to determine the total number of infective persons during the cycle. Conclusions: The actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles in the countries analyzed are determined, the total number of infected is determined, and it is statistically proven that the incubation cycle for Sars-CoV-2 is five days.","De Carvalho, R.

Infection of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with SARS-CoV-2 revealed robust transcriptomic and morphological signatures of damage in cardiomyocytes. These morphological signatures include a distinct pattern of sarcomere fragmentation, with specific cleavage of thick filaments, and numerous iPSC-cardiomyocytes that lacked nuclear DNA. Human autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients also displayed marked sarcomeric disruption and similar fragmentation, as well as prevalently enucleated cardiomyocytes.

Here, we present the identification of 200 approved drugs, appropriate for repurposing against COVID-19. We constructed a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) network, based on disease signatures defined by COVID-19 multi-omic datasets(Bojkova et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020), and cross-examined these pathways against approved drugs. This analysis identified 200 drugs predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-induced pathways, 40 of which are already in COVID-19 clinical trials(Clinicaltrials.gov, 2020) testifying to the validity of the approach. Using artificial neural network analysis we classified these 200 drugs into 9 distinct pathways, within two overarching mechanisms of action (MoAs): viral replication (130) and immune response (70). A subset of drugs implicated in viral replication were tested in cellular assays and two (proguanil and sulfasalazine) were shown to inhibit replication. This unbiased and validated analysis opens new avenues for the rapid repurposing of approved drugs into clinical trials.","Han, N.; Hwang, W.; Tzelepis, K.; Schmerer, P.; Yankova, E.; MacMahon, M.; Lei, W.; Katritsis, N.

40,Unique mutational changes in SARS-CoV2 genome of different state of India,"COVID-19 leads to a global emergency that causes more than 7 million causalities until mid-August throughout the world. In India alone, 2 million confirmed cases were reported that increased abruptly day by day with the lowest fatality rate. The availability of a large number of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) genome in the public domain provides a great opportunity to study mutational changes in COVID-19 genomes in Indian populations. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV2 viruses isolated from 47 individuals from 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India using Third Generation Sequencing Technology. We further did the phylogenetic clustering of UP state of Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes revealed a perceivable point that no UP samples were aligned on the USA defined clade where the fatality rate is high. We also identified 56 distinctive Single Nucleotide Polymorphism variations in UP state that majorly clustered into two groups which shows the deleterious effects on the genome. Additionally, we conducted the mutation analysis of the 2323 SARS-CoV2 genome of different states of India from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) where we find ~80% unique mutations rate in each sample of the Indian population. Thus, this is the first extensive mutational study of the largest state of Indian populations in which we report the novel deleterious SNPs in virus genome along with the other states which access the less infectious form of SARS-CoV2 genome through synonymous to nonsynonymous mutation variation.","Prasad, P.; Prakash, S.; Sahu, K.; Singh, B.; Shukla, S.; Mishra, H.; Khan, D.

41,The S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modulates cell entry pathways and transmission,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is posing major public health challenges. One unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1/S2 subunit cleavage site, the function of which remains uncertain. We found that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1/S2 site instead utilizes a less efficient endosomal entry pathway. This idea was supported by the identification of a suite of endosomal entry factors specific to Sdel virus by a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. A panel of host factors regulating the surface expression of ACE2 was identified for both viruses. Using a hamster model, animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus was almost completely abrogated, unlike with Sfull. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.","Zhu, Y.; Feng, F.; Hu, G.; Wang, Y.; Yu, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Xu, W.; Cai, X.; Sun, Z.; Han, W.; Ye, R.; Chen, H.; Ding, Q.; Cai, Q.; Qu, D.; Xie, Y.; Yuan, Z.; Zhang, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.266775v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.266775v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,False
42,SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Whole Human Proteome Cleavage Prediction and Enrichment/Depletion Analysis,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has devastated the globe as a pandemic that has killed more than 800,000 people. Effective and widespread vaccination is still uncertain, so many scientific efforts have been directed towards discovering antiviral treatments. Many drugs are being investigated to inhibit the coronavirus main protease, 3CLpro, from cleaving its viral polyprotein, but few publications have addressed this protease's interactions with the host proteome or their probable contribution to virulence. Too few host protein cleavages have been experimentally verified to fully understand 3CLpro's global effects on relevant cellular pathways and tissues. Here, we set out to determine this protease's targets and corresponding potential drug targets. Using a neural network trained on coronavirus proteomes with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.983, we predict that a large proportion of the human proteome is vulnerable to 3CLpro, with 4,460 out of approximately 20,000 human proteins containing at least one predicted cleavage site. These cleavages are nonrandomly distributed and are enriched in the epithelium along the respiratory tract, brain, testis, plasma, and immune tissues and depleted in olfactory and gustatory receptors despite the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients. Affected cellular pathways include cytoskeleton/motor/cell adhesion proteins, nuclear condensation and other epigenetics, host transcription and RNAi, coagulation, pattern recognition receptors, growth factor, lipoproteins, redox, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. This whole proteome cleavage prediction demonstrates the importance of 3CLpro in expected and nontrivial pathways affecting virulence, lead us to propose more than a dozen potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, and should therefore be applied to all viral proteases and experimentally verified.","Prescott, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265645v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265645v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,False

44,Stapled peptides based on Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and start the infection process. Therefore, it is prudent to design therapeutics based on the critical binding region of ACE2, which is a ~30 aa long helix with a kink in the middle. However, the small peptide in solution may lose its helical conformation and subsequently lose its binding potential to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which it utilizes to bind to that helical region. Here we report the design of four stapled peptides based on that helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50 - 94% helicity). On the contrary, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus based single-cycle assay in HT1080 and human lung cells, A549. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080 (IC50: 1.9 - 4.1 ) and A549 cells (IC50: 2.2 - 2.8 ). It is noteworthy that the stapled peptide, NYBSP-3, which showed the least helical content, also had the lowest antiviral activity in both cell lines. The linear peptides NYBSP-C and SBP1, reported recently to bind SARS-CoV-2 with KD of ~47nM affinity, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any appreciable cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T1/2) of >289 min.","Curreli, F.; Victor, S. M.

Currently, nearly 23 million cases have been confirmed worldwide with the highest COVID-19 cases been confirmed in the United States. As there is no vaccine or any effective interventions, massive efforts to create a potential vaccine to combat COVID-19 is underway. In the meantime, safety precautions and effective disease control strategies appear to be vital for preventing the virus spread in the public places. Due to the longevity of the virus on smooth surfaces, photocatalytic properties of self-disinfecting/cleaning surfaces appear to be a promising tool to help guide disinfection policies to control infectious SAR-CoV-2 spread in high-traffic areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, airports, schools, and stadiums. Here, we explored the photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO2 (TNPs) as induced by the UV radiation, towards virus deactivation. Our preliminary results using close genetic relative of SAR-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, showed the virucidal efficacy of photoactive TNPs deposited on glass coverslips, as examined by quantitative RT-PCR and virus culture assays.

46,The analysis of the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular immune system in individuals recovering from COVID-19 reveals a profound NKT cell impairment,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects millions of people and killed hundred-thousands of individuals. While acute and intermediate interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively, long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we comprehensively characterized immunological changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27 matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However, both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation. Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence even months after the recovery from disease.","liu, j.; Yang, X.; Wang, H.; Li, Z.; Deng, H.; jing, L.; Xiong, S.; He, J.; Guo, C.; Wang, W.; Zelinskyy, G.; Trilling, M.; Dittmer, U.; Lu, M.; Sutter, K.; Senff, T.; Menne, C.; Timm, J.; Zhang, Y.; Deng, F.; Feng, X.; Lu, Y.; Wu, J.; Yang, D.; Wang, B.; Zheng, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True

The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is the subject of an immune selective pressure which increases the variability in such region. This study aimed to identify mutations in the S gene among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focusing on the D614G mutation, that has a presumed fitness advantage. Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year based on large clusters' Bayesian analyses.

48,"Therapeutic Prospects for Th-17 Cell Immune Storm Syndrome and Neurological Symptoms in COVID-19: Thiamine Efficacy and Safety, In-vitro Evidence and Pharmacokinetic Profile","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg/day equivalent (0.01 ug/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. Further studies using thiamine as an interventional/prevention strategy in severe COVID-19 patients could identify its precise anti-inflammatory role.","Vatsalya, V.; Li, F.; Frimodig, J.

49,Role of interfering substances in the survival of coronaviruses on surfaces and their impact on the efficiency of hand and surface disinfection,"Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for hospital-acquired viral infections. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of interfering substances on SARS-CoV-2 surface stability and virucidal efficiency of hand sanitizers and surface disinfectant. To this end, surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 was measured on stainless steel in different experimental conditions, with or without an artificial mucus/saliva mixture and compared against that of human coronavirus HCoV-229E and feline coronavirus FCoV. The impact of the mucus/saliva mixture on the virucidal efficiency of 3 commercial alcohol hand sanitizers and 1 surface chemical disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and FCoV was then measured. Our results indicate that mucus/saliva mixture did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on the surface survival of tested viruses, with temperature being an important parameter. In addition, we demonstrated that interfering substances may play an important role in the virucidal efficacy of hand sanitizers and disinfectants, highlighting the need for adapted testing protocols that better reflect current - real life -conditions of use.","Szpiro, L.; Pizzorno, A.; Durimel, L.; Julien, T.; Traversier, A.; Bouchami, D.; Marie, Y.; Rosa-Calatrava, M.; Terrier, O.; Moules, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
50,FLOW CYTOMETRY MULTIPLEXED METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF NEUTRALIZING HUMAN ANTIBODIES TO THE NATIVE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN,"A correct identification of seropositive individuals for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is of paramount relevance to assess the degree of protection of a human population to present and future outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe here a sensitive and quantitative flow cytometry method using the cytometer-friendly non-adherent Jurkat T cell line that stably expresses the full-length native spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a truncated form of the human EGFR that serves a normalizing role. S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self-cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti-S immunoglobulins by calculating a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensities obtained by double- staining with the sera and a monoclonal antibody specific for EGFR. We show that the method allows to detect immune individuals regardless of the result of other serological tests or even repeated PCR monitoring. It can also be employed to detect neutralizing activity in the sera of individuals. Finally, the method can be used in a multiplexed format to simultaneously measure all anti-S human immunoglobulin isotypes in blood and mucosal fluids including total saliva.","Horndler, L.; Delgado, P.; Balabanov, I.; Cornish, G.; Llamas, M.

51,COVID-19 is associated with relative ADAMTS13 deficiency and VWF multimer formation resembling TTP,"Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, A. A.

52,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","Lemieux, J.; Siddle, K.

53,Epidemiologically most successful SARS-CoV-2 variant: concurrent mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike protein,"The D614G mutation of the Spike protein is thought to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we report biological and epidemiological aspects of this mutation. Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we were able to confirm that the G614 variant of the Spike protein is markedly more infectious than the ancestral D614 variant. We demonstrate by molecular modelling that the replacement of aspartate by glycine in position 614 facilitates the transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To understand whether the increased infectivity of the D614 variant explains its epidemiological success, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. There was no significant correlation between reported COVID mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. However, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Ilmjärv, S.; Abdul, F.; Acosta-Gutierrez, S.; Estarellas, C.; Galdadas, I.; Casimir, M.; Alessandrini, M.; Gervasio, F.

54,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in children: accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate.,"The tests currently used for the direct identification of SARS-CoV-2 include specimens taken from upper and lower respiratory tract; recommendations from Word Health Organization prioritise nasopharyngeal swab (NS). In literature there are not available paediatric studies about the identification of SARS-CoV-2 through nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), but the use of NPA is deemed to be better than NS to identify respiratory viruses in children. The aim of our study is to evaluate diagnostic performances of NS compared to NPA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([&ge;] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","Di Pietro, G.

Rotation was also less tolerable for participants. Notably, both discomfort and nucleic acid recovery were significantly higher in Asians, consistent with nasal anatomy differences. Our results suggest that it is unnecessary to rotate the swab in place following contact with the nasopharynx, and reveal that procedural discomfort levels can differ by ethnicity.","Kinloch, N.

56,Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of outpatients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19: A multi-center observational study,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has not been associated with improved survival among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the majority of observational studies and similarly was not identified as an effective prophylaxis following exposure in a prospective randomized trial. We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization.

57,A deterministic linear infection model to inform Risk-Cost-Benefit Analysis of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Risk-cost-benefit analysis requires the enumeration of decision alternatives, their associated outcomes, and the quantification of uncertainty. Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, J.

60,Suitability of Google Trends ™ for digital surveillance during ongoing COVID-19 epidemic: a case study from India,"Background: India went into the largest population-level lockdown on 25th March 2020 in response to the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Digital surveillance has been shown to be useful to supplement the traditional surveillance. Google Trends  (GT) is one such platform reported to be useful during pandemics of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. Objective: We used GT to correlate the information seeking behaviour regarding COVID-19 of Indians with curiosity and apprehensiveness generated through media coverage as well as status of the epidemic both at national and state levels. Methods: We retrieved GT data between 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020 for India using a comprehensive search strategy. We obtained data on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org websites. We explored the trends of COVID-19 in the form of relative search volume (RSV) from GT platform and correlated them with media reports. We used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between Google search terms and daily new COVID-19 cases and daily tests for 14 days. Results: Peaks in RSV correlated with media coverage or government declarations suggestive of curiosity and apprehensiveness both at national level and high-burden states. High time-lag correlation was observed between both the daily reported number of tests and cases and RSV for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'' and ''lockdown'' at national level. Similar high time-lag correlation was observed for the terms ''COVID 19'', ''COVID'', ''Corona'', ''social distancing'', ''soap'', ''lockdown'' in five high-burden states. Conclusion: This study reveals the advantages of infodemiology using GT to monitor an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19 in India. Google searches in India during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic reflects mostly curiosity and apprehension of citizens. GT can also complement traditional surveillance in India as well as high burden states.","Satpathy, P.

While evidence suggests masks help curb the spread of respiratory pathogens, research is limited. Face masks have quickly become a topic of public debate as government mandates have started requiring their use. Here we investigate the association between self-reported mask wearing, social distancing and community SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States, as well as the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. Methods: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered June 3 through July 31, 2020 via web platform. Surveys queried individuals' likelihood to wear a face mask to the grocery store or with family and friends. Responses (N=378,207) were aggregated by week and state and combined with measures of the instantaneous reproductive number (Rt), social distancing proxies, respondent demographics and other potential sources of confounding. We fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask wearing and community transmission control (Rt <1) for each state and week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were considered to corroborate findings across mask wearing definitions, Rt estimators and data sources. Additionally, mask wearing in 12 states was evaluated two weeks before and after statewide mandates. Results: We find an upward trend in mask usage across the U.S., although uptake varies by geography and demographic groups. A multivariate logistic model controlling for social distancing and other variables found a 10% increase in mask wearing was associated with a 3.53 (95% CI: 2.03, 6.43) odds of transmission control (Rt <1). We also find that communities with high mask wearing and social distancing have the highest predicted probability of a controlled epidemic. These positive associations were maintained across sensitivity analyses. Segmented regression analysis of mask wearing found no statistical change following mandates, however the positive trend of increased mask wearing over time was preserved. Conclusion: Widespread utilization of face masks combined with social distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Mask wearing rose separately from government mask mandates, suggesting supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximize mask adoption and disrupt the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially as social distancing measures are relaxed.","Rader, B.; White, L.

We conducted a global survey in June 2020 of 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine potential acceptance rates of a COVID-19 vaccine and factors influencing acceptance. We ran univariate logistic regressions to examine the associations with demographic variables. 71.5% reported they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine; 61.4% reported they would accept their employer's recommendation to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Differences in acceptance across countries ranged from almost 9 in 10 (China) to fewer than 6 in 10 (Russia). Respondents reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were more likely to accept a vaccine, and take their employer's advice to do so. Targeted interventions addressing age, sex, income, and education level are required to increase and sustain public acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Lazarus, J.

65,Wastewater sample site selection to estimate geographically-resolved community prevalence of COVID-19: A research protocol,"Background: Wastewater monitoring for virus infections within communities can complement conventional clinical surveillance. Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 testing is performed during clinical encounters with symptomatic individuals, and therefore likely underrepresents actual population prevalence. Randomized testing on a regular basis to estimate population-level infection rates is prohibitively costly and is hampered by a range of barriers associated with participation in clinical research. In comparison, community-level fecal monitoring can be performed through wastewater surveillance and can effectively surveil communities with less temporal lag than other surveillance methods. However, epidemiologically-defined protocols for wastewater sample site selection are lacking. Methods: Herein we describe methods for developing a geographically-resolved population-level wastewater sampling approach in Jefferson County, Kentucky which may have general applicability for cities throughout the United States. This approach was developed by the selection of sampling locations along sewer lines transporting raw wastewater from geographically and demographically distinct areas that correspond with locations where random testing of residents occurs. Conclusions: Development of this protocol for population-level sampling for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater can be utilized to inform consistent wastewater monitoring among cities for up-to-date and geographically-resolved information on COVID-19 prevalence within communities. This information could substantially supplement public health surveillance of COVID-19 and thus serve to better guide targeted mitigation strategies throughout the United States.","Yeager, R.

66,3D Printed N95 Equivalent for PPE Shortages: The Kansas City Mask,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was well-reported and discussed, not only in the healthcare sector but across all of society as the demands for PPE skyrocketed. As hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness continue to increase, many recent reports indicate the supply of PPE is persistently and significantly less than the demand. These PPE shortages encouraged communities of 3D printing experts and hobbyists to design and distribute homemade, 3D-printed PPE, including N95 mask substitutes. The mask presented, the Kansas City Mask (KC Mask), is one such product which was created from the maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This report discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the KC Mask design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods: The KC Mask was adapted from a similar design called the Montana Mask. Mask components were 3D printed and assembled then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, MO as a proof of concept. Results: The QLFT was successful and the KC Mask was approved for use by pandemic response administration staff at the hospital. Fortunately, the KC Mask has not required wide utilization, however, because supply chains for Kansas City area hospitals have, at the time of this publication, not yet been exhausted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The results of Truman Medical Center approval of the KC Mask are promising for this N95 stop-gap substitute. Although further analysis and study is needed for this design, persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitate an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for the KC Mask as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse the KC Mask as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage based on CDC guidelines.","Dalla, S.; Bacon, B.; Ayres, J.

However, much less attention has focussed on the overall cost to health sectors, including the full human resource costs and the health system costs to address the pandemic. Here we present estimates of the total costs of COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries for different scenarios of COVID-19 mitigation over a one year period. We find costs vary substantially by setting, but in some settings even mitigation scenarios place a substantial fiscal impact on the health system. We conclude that the choices facing many low- and middle- income countries, without further rapid emergency financial support, are stark, between fully funding an effective COVID-19 reponse or other core essential health services.","Torres Rueda, S.; Sweeney, S.; Bozzani, F.; Vassall, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20180299v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20180299v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
69,Teamwork in the manufacturing workplace may hinder social distance,"The spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections show no signs of stopping. Therefore, if the era of With-Colona will continue for a while, we must consider how to deal with this disaster well. The practice of social distance is one of the powerful tools for that purpose. In previous research, analysis of the factors that influence social distance has also been carried out using information from the US occupation information site O*NET. However, they targeted all industries, not specific industries. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the factors that influence Physical Proximity in the manufacturing industry, which has a large impact on the economy given the scale of employment. As the method, first, exploratory factor analysis is performed using O*NET information, and the extracted 7 variables, Sitting Work, Adverse Conditions, Information Processing, Bridging Work, Teamwork, Response to Aggression, and Intelligent Work, are used in the regression analysis. As a result, it was shown that Teamwork is the biggest factor that influences Physical Proximity. Also, Adverse Conditions and Response to Aggression showed a positive correlation and Sitting Work showed a negative correlation. By job type, Maintenance, Installation & Repair tended to have higher Physical Proximity than Manufacturing Production Process Development, Production & Quality Assurance.","Kokubun, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179994v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20179994v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True

Ca-DelMut replicates more efficiently than wild type or parental virus in cells, but causes no apparent disease in hamsters, despite replicating in respiratory tissues.

71,Discovery of drugs to treat cytokine storm-induced cardiac dysfunction using human cardiac organoids,"SARS-CoV2 infection leads to cardiac injury and dysfunction in 20-30% of hospitalized patients1 and higher rates of mortality in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease2,3. Inflammatory factors released as part of the  cytokine storm are thought to play a critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients4. Here we use human cardiac organoids combined with high sensitivity phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing to identify inflammatory targets inducing cardiac dysfunction. This state-of-the-art pipeline allowed rapid deconvolution of mechanisms and identification of putative therapeutics. We identify a novel interferon-{gamma} driven BRD4 (bromodomain protein 4)-fibrosis/iNOS axis as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This axis is therapeutically targetable using BRD4 inhibitors, which promoted full recovery of function in human cardiac organoids and prevented severe inflammation and death in a cytokine-storm mouse model. The BRD inhibitor INCB054329 was the most efficacious, and is a prime candidate for drug repurposing to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and improve COVID-19 mortality in humans.","Mills, R.

72,Impaired cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response in elderly COVID-19 patients,"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a T cell response that most likely contributes to virus control in COVID-19 patients, but may also induce immunopathology. Until now, the cytotoxic T cell response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients.

Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that may also have important implications for vaccine development.

ImportanceCytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group in comparison to younger patients.","Westmeier, J.; Paniskaki, K.; Karaköse, Z.; Werner, T.; Sutter, K.; Dolff, S.; Overbeck, M.; Limmer, A.; Liu, J.; Zheng, X.; Brenner, T.; Berger, M.

73,"Versatile, Multivalent Nanobody Cocktails for Highly Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization","The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global health and the economy. Cost-effective, highly efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed. Here, we used camelid immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered multiple elite Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral infection at sub-ng/ml concentration, more potent than some of the best human neutralizing antibodies. We determined a crystal structure of such an elite neutralizing Nb in complex with RBD. Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. Structural characterization facilitated the bioengineering of novel multivalent Nb constructs into multi-epitope cocktails that achieved ultrahigh neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist lyophilization, and aerosolization.

74,Antiviral activity of lambda-carrageenan against influenza viruses in mice and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro,"Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan ({lambda}-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with EC50 values ranging from 0.3-1.4 g/ml. No toxicity to host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 g/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that {lambda}-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing entry. Moreover, intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, {lambda}-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection by several respiratory viruses.","Jang, Y. J.; Shin, H.; Lee, M. K.; Kwon, O. S.; Shin, J.

75,"The SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Membrane proteins modulate maturation and retention of the Spike protein, allowing optimal formation of VLPs in presence of Nucleoprotein","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a {beta}-coronavirus, is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interplays during the assembly process of this new virus are poorly-defined and are likely {beta}-coronavirus-type different. Therefore, we sought to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 behaves for its assembly by expression assays of S, in combination with E, M and/or N. By combining biochemical and imaging assays, we showed that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S and hence its furin-mediated processing. Indeed, our imaging data revealed that S remains at ERGIC or Golgi compartments upon expression of E or M, like for SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. By studying a mutant of S, we showed that its cytoplasmic tail, and more specifically, its C-terminal retrieval motif, is required for the M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlighted that E and M induce a specific maturation of S N-glycosylation, which is observed on particles and lysates from infected cells independently of its mechanisms of intracellular retention. Finally, we showed that both M, E and N are required for optimal production of virus-like-proteins. Altogether, our results indicated that E and M proteins influence the properties of S proteins to promote assembly of viral particles. Our results therefore highlight both similarities and dissimilarities in these events, as compared to other {beta}-coronaviruses.

Author SummaryThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its viral particles are composed of four structural proteins, namely Spike S, Envelope E, Membrane M and Nucleoprotein N proteins, though their involvement in the virion assembly remain unknown for this particular coronavirus. Here we showed that presence of E and M influence the localization and maturation of S protein, in term of cleavage and N-glycosylation maturation. Indeed, E protein is able to slow down the cell secretory pathway whereas M-induced retention of S requires the retrieval motif in S C-terminus. We also highlighted that E and M might regulate the N glycosylation maturation of S independently of its intracellular retention mechanism. Finally, we showed that the four structural proteins are required for optimal formation of virus-like particles, highlighting the involvement of N, E and M in assembly of infectious particles.

Although several clinical trials have evaluated the use of convalescent plasma containing virus-neutralizing antibodies, the effectiveness has not been proven. We show that hamsters treated with a high dose of human convalescent plasma or a monoclonal antibody were protected against weight loss showing reduced pneumonia and pulmonary virus replication compared to control animals. However, a ten-fold lower dose of convalescent plasma showed no protective effect. Thus, variable and relatively low levels of virus neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma may limit their use for effective antiviral therapy, favouring concentrated, purified (monoclonal) antibodies.","Haagmans, B.

To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-02-01 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.","Fisher, E.; Padula, L.; Podack, K.; O'Neill, K.; Seavey, M.

78,A negative feedback model to explain regulation of SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription,"BackgroundCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been preliminarily revealed recently, their regulation is still unclear.

ResultsBy reanalysis of public data, we proposed a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription of, but not limited to coronavirus (CoVs). The key step leading to new discoveries is that we identified the cleavage sites of nps15, an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) or genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleavage of transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs. The increase of nsp15 results in the decrease of itself to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs.

ConclusionsThe replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback strategy. This is a basic mechanism to influence the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our study indicates that nsp15 is an important and ideal target for drug development against CoVs.","Shan, G.; Zhi, C.; Xiufeng, J.; Fang, W.; Yibo, X.; Hao, Z.; Chang, L.; Jishou, R.; Guangyou, D.; Xin, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False

Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

ImportanceThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS, and COVID-19.","Matsuyama, S.; Kawase, M.; Nao, N.; Shirato, K.; Ujike, M.; Kamitani, W.; Shimojima, M.; Fukushi, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.258459v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
80,Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases the expression of the SARS-CoV2 entry protease TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells,"The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic pulmonary respiratory diseases (COPD). Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are playing a critical role in the immune response and in COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

In this report we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its virulence factor flagellin (Fla-PA), a ligand of Toll-Like receptor 5 are able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in control and CF AEC. In contrast, no effect was observed with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium flagellin, used as an adjuvant in the clinical development of new vaccines against respiratory viruses. Considering the urgency of the health situation, this result is of major significance for patients with CRD (COPD, CF) which are frequently infected and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of the disease. In the general population, a P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 patients under intubation in intensive care units could be also deleterious and should be monitored with care.","Ruffin, M.; Bigot, J.; Calmel, C.; Corvol, H.; Balloy, V.; Guillot, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
81,Dynamics of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein drives dsRNA melting in a counterintuitive tweezer-like mechanism,"The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and * 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.","Caruso, I.

82,An hACE2 peptide mimic blocks SARS-CoV-2 Pulmonary Cell Infection,"In the light of the recent accumulated knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its mode of human cells invasion, the binding of viral spike glycoprotein to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor plays a central role in cell entry. We designed a series of peptides mimicking the N-terminal helix of hACE2 protein which contains most of the contacting residues at the binding site and have a high helical folding propensity in aqueous solution. Our best peptide mimic binds to the virus spike protein with high affinity and is able to block SARS-CoV-2 human pulmonary cell infection with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range. This first in class blocking peptide mimic represents a powerful tool that might be used in prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

83,Lipid droplets fuels SARS-CoV-2 replication and inflammatory response,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that make use of the host metabolic machineries to meet their biosynthetic needs, identifying the host pathways essential for the virus replication may lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms and pathways explored by SARS-CoV-2 to support its replication within host cells are not fully known. Lipid droplets (LD) are organelles with major functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, and have multiple roles in infections and inflammation. Here we demonstrate that monocytes from COVID-19 patients have an increased LD accumulation compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. In vitro, SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pathways of lipid synthesis and uptake, as CD36, SREBP-1, PPAR{gamma} and DGAT-1 in human monocytes and triggered LD formation in different human cells. LDs were found in close apposition with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and double-stranded (ds)-RNA. The pharmacological modulation of LD formation by inhibition of DGAT-1 with A922500 significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Taken together, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic reprograming and LD formation in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis, opening new opportunities for therapeutic strategies to COVID-19.","Gomes Dias, S.

84,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using a vesicular stomatitis virus possessing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is now classified in the genus Coronavirus with closely related SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, which makes manipulating it relatively difficult due to its infectious nature. To circumvent the need for BSL-3 laboratories, an alternative assay was developed that avoids live virus and instead uses a recombinant VSV expressing luciferase and possesses the full length or truncated spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions, a chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT) for SARS-CoV-2 was developed. The neutralization values of the serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative donors against the pseudotyped virus infection evaluated by the CRNT were compared with antibody titers determined from an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The CRNT, which used whole blood collected from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was also examined. As a result, the inhibition of pseudotyped virus infection was specifically observed in both serum and whole blood and was also correlated with the results of the IFA. In conclusion, the CRNT for COVID-19 is a convenient assay system that can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the occurrence of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Tani, H.; Tan, L.; Kimura, M.; Yoshida, Y.; Yamada, H.; Fukushi, S.; Saijo, M.; Kawasuji, H.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Sakamaki, I.; Yamamoto, Y.; Morinaga, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.262295v1?rss=1,2020-08-23,2020-08-23,,False

The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 protein was evaluated by Western Blotting (WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency of it was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256.

86,Ferrets not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in a high-exposure domestic setting,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic COVID-19. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein (Spike) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data support that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. This may be overcome in laboratory settings using concentrated viral inoculum, but the effects of ferret host-adaptations require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, K.; Hill, N. J.; Puryear, W.

Here, we functionally define the role SARS-CoV-2 spike plays as a target of the human neutralizing antibody response. In this study, we identify the spike protein subunits that contain antigenic determinants and examine the neutralization capacity of polyclonal sera from a cohort of patients that tested qRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using an ELISA format, we assessed binding of human sera to spike subunit 1 (S1), spike subunit 2 (S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike. To functionally identify the key target of neutralizing antibody, we depleted sera of subunit-specific antibodies to determine the contribution of these individual subunits to the antigen-specific neutralizing antibody response. We show that epitopes within RBD are the target of a majority of the neutralizing antibodies in the human polyclonal antibody response.

89,Dynamic competition between SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 and mRNA on the human ribosome inhibits translation initiation,"SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged as a human pathogen and is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","Lapointe, C. P.; Grosely, R.; Johnson, A. G.; Wang, J.; Fernandez, I.

90,Unraveling the molecular basis of host cell receptor usage in SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic β-CoVs,"The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.

SignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to arise.","Pontes, C.; Ruiz-Serra, V.

Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases.

Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution ([~]100 nm, without peplomers). SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The segmental peplomer density of SARS-CoV was approximately 30% higher than the corresponding peplomer density of SARS-CoV-2.

To address this important knowledge deficit, we determined in vitro live-virus neutralizing capacity and persistence of IgM and IgG antibody responses against the receptor-binding domain and S1 ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in 540 convalescent plasma samples obtained from 175 COVID-19 plasma donors for up to 142 days post-symptom onset. Robust IgM, IgG, and viral neutralization responses to SARS-CoV-2 persist, in the aggregate, for at least 100 days post-symptom onset. However, a notable acceleration in decline in virus neutralization titers [&ge;]160, a value suitable for convalescent plasma therapy, was observed starting 60 days after first symptom onset. Together, these findings better define the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma useful for immunotherapy of COVID-19 patients and reveal important predictors of an ideal plasma donor, including age and COVID-19 disease severity score.

One Sentence SummaryEvaluation of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgM, IgG, and live-virus neutralizing titer profiles reveals that the optimal window for donating convalescent plasma for use in immunotherapy is within the first 60 days of symptom onset.","Gontu, A.; Srinivasan, S.; Salazar, E.; Surendran Nair, M.; Nissly, R.

96,Iota carrageenan and xylitol inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell culture,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affecting millions of persons around the world. There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 {micro}g/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","Vega, J. C.; Bansal, S.; Jonsson, C. B.; Taylor, S.

97,Ubiquitous Forbidden Order in R-group classified protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses,"Each amino acid in a polypeptide chain has a distinctive R-group associated with it. We report here a novel method of species characterization based upon the order of these R-group classified amino acids in the linear sequence of the side chains associated with the codon triplets. In an otherwise pseudo-random sequence, we search for forbidden combinations of kth order. We applied this method to analyze the available protein sequences of various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We found that these ubiquitous forbidden orders (UFO) are unique to each of the viruses we analyzed. This unique structure of the viruses may provide an insight into viruses chemical behavior and the folding patterns of the proteins. This finding may have a broad significance for the analysis of coding sequences of species in general.","Pratibha, P.; Shaju, C.; Kamal, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.261289v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.261289v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
98,"Astodrimer sodium, dendrimer antiviral, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro","An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will require a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, J.

99,COVID-19 and Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway: In silico Identification of an Interaction between alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor and the Cryptic Epitopes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR. We found that the interface of all studied protein complexes involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human 7 nAChR.","Lagoumintzis, G.; Chasapis, C.; Alexandris, N.; Tzartos, S.; Eliopoulos, E.; Farsalinos, K.; Poulas, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259747v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259747v1?rss=1,2020-08-21,2020-08-21,,False
