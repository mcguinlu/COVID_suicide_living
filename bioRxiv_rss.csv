0,Kynurenic acid underlies sex-specific immune responses to COVID-19,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has poorer clinical outcomes in males compared to females, and immune responses underlie these sex-related differences in disease trajectory. As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID- 19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes, in COVID-19 infection.","Cai, Y.; Kim, D. J.; Takahashi, T.; Broadhurst, D. I.; Ma, S.; Rattray, N. J.

1,Activin/Follistatin-axis deregulation is independently associated with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality,"Rationale: Activins are inflammatory and tissue-repair-related members of the TGF{beta}-superfamily that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several immuno-inflammatory disorders including sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that they might be of particular relevance to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Objectives: To assess the involvement of the Activin-Follistatin-axis in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: Levels of Activins -A, -B and their physiological inhibitor Follistatin, were retrospectively analyzed in 314 serum samples from 117 COVID-19 patients derived from two independent centers and compared with common demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. Optimal-scaling with ridge-regression was used to screen variables and establish a prediction model. Main Results: The Activin/Follistatin-axis was significantly deregulated during the course of COVID-19 and was independently associated with severity and in-hospital mortality. FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel disease scoring system, adding one point for each of Follistatin >6235 pg/ml, Activin-A >591 pg/ml, Activin-B >249 pg/ml, CRP >10.3 mg/dL, LDH >427 U/L, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte-Ratio >5.6, Years of Age >61, Comorbidities >1 and D-dimers >1097 ng/ml, efficiently predicted and monitored fatal outcome independently of multiplicity and timing of sampling (AUC: 0.951{+/-}0.032, p<10-6). Validation in 35 samples derived from a third hospital indicated comparable AUC (0.958{+/-}0.086, p=0.032). Conclusion: This study unravels the link between Activin/Folistatin-axis and COVID-19 mortality and introduces FACT-CLINYCoD, a novel pathophysiology-based tool that copes with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of COCVID-19, predicts disease outcome and supports clinical decision making. Prospective large-scale validation of this calculator, as well as investigation of the mechanisms linking Activin/Folistatin-axis to COVID-19 pathogenesis is warranted.","Synolaki, E.; Papadopoulos, V.; Divolis, G.; Gavriilidis, E.; Loli, G.; Gavriil, A.; Tsigalou, C.; Tsachouridou, O.; Sertaridou, E.; Rafailidis, P.; Pasternack, A.; Boumpas, D.; Germanidis, G.; Ritvos, O.; Metalidis, S.; Skendros, P.; Sideras, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20184655v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20184655v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
2,Beneficial and Harmful Outcomes of Tocilizumab in Severe COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Pending for randomized control trials, the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 is based on observational studies and remains controversial. Purpose: To summarize evidence about the effect of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases from 1 January to 21 August 2020. Study Selection: Observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Data Extraction: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. Data synthesis: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 were controlled and 30 were not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group vs. the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). The overall NNT to avoid one death was 20. In hospital wards, patients in the TCZ-group were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion than those in the control group; however, ICU mortality of the TCZ-group was lower than in the control group. Secondary infections occurred in a higher proportion in TCZ-treated patients. Among survivors, the length of stay was similar in both groups. Limitations: Conclusions should be considered as weak evidence since they are based on observational studies, most of them retrospective. A variety of factors influencing the indication and effect of TCZ could not be evaluated in-depth. Conclusions: TCZ to seem beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Conversely, patients receiving TCZ appear to be at higher risk for secondary infections, especially those admitted to ICU.","Rubio-Rivas, M.; Mora-Lujan, J. M.; Montero, A.; Homs, N.

3,Ethnicity and clinical outcomes in COVID-19A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Importance The association of ethnicity with outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is unclear. Objective To determine whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality are associated with ethnicity. Data Sources We searched all English language articles published 1st December 2019 - 30th June 2020 within MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROSPERO and the Cochrane library using indexing terms for COVID-19 and ethnicity, as well as manuscripts awaiting peer review on MedRxiv during the same period. Study Selection Included studies reported original clinical data, disaggregated by ethnicity, on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. We excluded correspondence, area level, modelling and basic science articles. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion. Of 926 identified articles, 35 were included in the meta-analyses. Data Extraction and Synthesis The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data using a piloted form on: (1) rates of infection, ICU admission and mortality by ethnicity; and (2) unadjusted and adjusted data comparing ethnic minority and White groups. Data were pooled using random effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were: (1) infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on molecular testing; (2) ICU admission; and (3) mortality in COVID-19 confirmed and suspected cases. Results 13,535,562 patients from 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Black, Asian and Hispanic individuals had a greater risk of infection compared to White individuals (Black: pooled adjusted RR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.59-2.67; Asian: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59; Hispanic: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.39-2.25). Black individuals were significantly more likely to be admitted to ICU than White individuals (pooled adjusted RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55). Risk of mortality was similar across ethnicities among hospitalised patients, but increased among Asian and Mixed ethnic groups in the general population. Conclusions Black, Asian and Hispanic ethnic groups are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Black individuals may be more likely to require ICU admission for COVID-19. There may also be disparities in risk of death from COVID-19 at a population level. Our findings are of critical public health importance and should inform policy on minimising SARS-CoV-2 exposure in ethnic minority groups.","Sze, S.; Pan, D.; Gray, L. J.; Nevill, C. R.; Martin, C.

4,Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in Coronavirus Diseases 2019 Patients with Different Severity,"Background: More understanding of antibody responses in the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is useful for vaccine development. Aim: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG among COVID-19 Thai patients with different severity. Methods: We used plasma from 118 adult patients who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 49 patients under investigation without infection, 20 patients with other respiratory infections, and 102 healthy controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Euroimmun. The optical density ratio cut off for positive test was 1.1 for IgA and 0.8 for IgG. The association of antibody response with the severity of diseases and the day of symptoms was performed. Results: From Mar 10 to May 31, 2020, 289 participants were enrolled, and 384 samples were analyzed. Patients were categorized by clinical manifestations to mild (n=59), moderate (n=27) and severe (n=32). The overall sensitivity of IgA and IgG from samples collected after day 7 is 87.9% (95% CI 79.8-93.6) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.2-91.3), respectively. The severe group had a significantly higher level of specific IgA and IgG to S1 antigen compared to the mild group. All moderate to severe patients have specific IgG while 20% of the mild group did not have any IgG detected after two weeks. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was significantly higher in males compared to females among the severe group (p=0.003). Conclusion: The serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 has high sensitivity after the second week after onset of illness. Serological response differs among patients with different severity and different sex.","Kowitdamrong, E.; Puthanakit, T.; Jantarabenjakul, W.; Prompetchara, E.; Suchartlikitwong, P.; Putcharoen, O.; Hirankarn, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189480v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189480v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
5,Multiscale statistical physics of the Human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome,"Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID--19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","Ghavasieh, A.; Bontorin, S.; Artime, O.; De Domenico, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189266v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
6,"Relationships of total COVID-19 cases and deaths with ten demographic, economic and social indicators","We have used data for 45 countries with a population of over 30 millions in which 85.8% of the world's population lives. The statistical relationships of total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths per million populations in these countries with 10 demographic, economic and social indicators (indices) were studied. These indicators are Life Expectancy, Median Age, Growth Rate, Population Density, GDP PPP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), Gini index of income equality, Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Democracy Index. Statistically significant relationships were found with all indicators excluding Gini index and Population Density. We have found that the closest is the relationship of Deaths per million population and total Cases per million population with correlation coefficient R = 0.926. Therefore, it is clear statistically that the more are Cases per million in a country the more are Deaths per million. This confirms the correctness of the timely and effective introduction of the necessary pandemic restrictions in the countries. It is interesting that the close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a purely economic index like GDP PPP per capita, where R = 0.687 and R = 0.660, respectively. Even more close correlations were found of Cases and Deaths per 1 million with a composite index HDI, where the correlation coefficients reach 0.724 and 0.680, respectively. This paradoxical results show that the richest and well-being countries are most seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The most probable reason for this is the large percentage of aging population, comorbidity of population with severe chronic diseases and obesity in countries with high GDP and HDI. No less important reason appears the delayed and/or insufficiently effective pandemic restrictions in these countries, which have underestimated the danger of a pandemic in early stage. Other indicators (excluding Gini index and Population Density) also show statistically significant correlations with Cases and Deaths per 1 million with correlation coefficients from 0.432 to 0.634. The countries that deviates the most from the regression lines were shown. Surprisingly, there was no statistically significant correlation between Cases and Deaths with Population Density. The statistical significance of the found correlations determined using Student's t-test was p <0.0001. The countries that deviate the most from both sides of the regression line were shown. It has been shown that the correlations of COVID-19 cases and Deaths with the studied indicators decrease with time.

7,Frequency and accuracy of proactive testing for COVID-19,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has proven difficult to control not only because of its high transmissibility, but because those who are infected readily spread the virus before symptoms appear, and because some infected individuals, though contagious, never exhibit symptoms. Proactive testing of asymptomatic individuals is therefore a powerful, and probably necessary, tool for preventing widespread infection in many settings. This paper explores the effectiveness of alternative testing regimes, in which the frequency, the accuracy, and the delay between testing and results determine the time path of infection. For a simple model of disease transmission, we present analytic formulas that determine the effect of testing on the expected number of days of during which an infectious individual is exposed to the population at large. This allows us to estimate the frequency of testing that would be required to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks, and to explore the trade-offs between frequency, accuracy, and delay in achieving this objective. We conclude by discussing applications to outbreak control on college and university campuses.","Bergstrom, T.; Bergstrom, C.

8,Characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Previous studies reported the recurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among discharge patients. This study aimed to examine the characteristic of repositive COVID-19 cases by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to August 17, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of RNA repositive among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 37 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 2,436 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 16% (95% CI, 12% to 20%) patients was repositive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 15% (95% CI, 11% to 18%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea. Among recurrence cases, it was estimated 43% (95% CI, 31% to 55%) subjects underlying at least one comorbidity. The estimates for times from disease onset to admission, from admission to discharge, and from discharge to RNA positive conversion were 17.3, 16.7, and 10.5 days, respectively. Conclusions: This study summarized up-to-date evidence from case reports, case series, and observational studies for the characteristic of COVID-19 recurrence cases after discharge. It is recommended to pay attention to follow-up patients after discharge, even if they have been in quarantine.","Hoang, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20189134v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20189134v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
9,Quantifying Inaccuracies in Modeling COVID-19 Pandemic within a Continuous Time Picture,"Typically, mathematical simulation studies on COVID-19 pandemic forecasting are based on deterministic differential equations which assume that both the number (n) of individuals in various epidemiological classes and the time (t) on which they depend are quantities that vary continuous. This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position Tc1/2 obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position Td1/2 predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift {tau} {equiv} Tc1/2 - Td1/2 < 0 is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate {kappa}. For a broad range of {kappa} values deduced from COVID-19 data at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a rather robust estimate {tau} {approx} -2.65 day-1. Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real system.","Baldea, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188755v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188755v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
10,Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in India: An open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial (PLACID Trial),"Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases. We investigated its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19. Design: Open-label, parallel-arm, phase II, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-nine public and private hospitals across India. Participants: Hospitalized, moderately ill confirmed COVID-19 patients (PaO2/FiO2: 200-300 or respiratory rate > 24/min and SpO2 [&le;] 93% on room air). Intervention: Participants were randomized to either control (best standard of care (BSC)) or intervention (CP + BSC) arm. Two doses of 200 mL CP was transfused 24 hours apart in the intervention arm. Main Outcome Measure: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2<100) or all-cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. Results: Between 22 nd April to 14 th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44 (18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (13.6%) and 31 (14.6%) participants in intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: -0.61 to 1.83]. Interpretation: CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.","Agarwal, A.; Mukherjee, A.; Kumar, G.; Chatterjee, P.; Bhatnagar, T.; Malhotra, P.; Latha, B.; Bundas, S.; Kumar, V.; Dosi, R.; Khambholja, J.

12,"In severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 induces a chronic, TGF-β-dominated adaptive immune response","The human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly variable, with less than 10% of infections resulting in severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Here we have analyzed the dynamics of the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 ICU patients at the level of single cell transcriptomes and B cell and T cell receptor (BCR, TCR) repertoires. Early after ICU admission, before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, patients generate activated peripheral B cells with a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature. After seroconversion, patients display circulating activated B cells expressing an IL-21-induced gene expression signature and mainly IgG1 and IgA1, two isotypes induced by IL-21 and TGF-{beta}, respectively. In sustained COVID-19, the persistent immune reaction is shifted to IgA2-expressing activated peripheral B cells, displaying somatic hypermutation, and expressing TGF-{beta}-induced signature genes, like IgA germline transcripts. The switch from an IgG1 to an IgA2-dominated B cell response correlates with the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 reactive follicular T helper cells expressing IL-21 and/or TGF-{beta} in the blood. Despite the continued presence of IgA2-expressing B cells and IgA antibodies in the blood of progressed COVID-19 patients, IgA2 secreting cells were scarce in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients. In summary, in severely affected COVID-19 patients SARS-CoV-2 triggers chronic immune reactions which are controlled by TGF-{beta}, with most of the activated B cells being no longer specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor binding domain, nor for nucleoprotein. TGF-{beta} may candidate as a target to ameliorate detrimental immunopathology in those patients.","Ferreira-Gomes, M.; Kruglov, A.; Durek, P.; Heinrich, F.; Tizian, C.; Heinz, G.

13,Development and Validation of the Patient History COVID-19 (PH-Covid19) Scoring System: A Multivariable Prediction Model of Death in Mexican Patients with COVID-19,"We sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors. We conducted a national retrospective cohort in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. To develop the model, we included 264,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 28 and May 30, 2020. To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","Mancilla-Galindo, J.; Vera-Zertuche, J.

14,"The impact of mobility restriction measures on the reproduction index of Covid-19 in the city of Queretaro, Mexico","An observational study based on official data (CONACYT and Ministry of Health) was carried out in which the effective reproduction index R(e) and the reproduction index R0 are compared with the mobility presented by Google. Additionally, an overview of the development of the pandemic in Queretaro, Mexico. Highlights key events; such as the main government interventions and social factors that could affect the society behavior. A positive relationship is observed between Re, R0, and the levels of mobility presented by Google. This indicates that an increase in mobility is associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In February, a significant decrease in mobility is observed, which lasts until approximately May 1st. This period corresponds to an R0 and R(e) between 1.17 and 1.87. After May 1st, there is a sustained increase in mobility levels. And, as of May 16, the effective reproduction index R (e) and the reproduction index R0 begin to increase. This is expected as it reflects the delay between the infection and the diagnosis of COVID-19. The R0 and R (e) increase from 1.45 on May 16 to 3.59 on July 5. According to the baseline of normal mobility levels, an increase from -49.6% on May 1st, to -20.6% on July 5 was observed. Based on these data, we conclude that the relaxation of restrictive mobility measures should be reconsidered. Despite this, mobility restrictions must not be a unique mitigation strategy for controlling the Reproductive Index. A comprehensive approach is needed, which generates socio-behavioral changes that allow a further reduction in reproductive rates.","San Roman Orozco, O.; Agraz Orozco, S.; Gutierrez Alvarez, I.

15,Modelling the transmission of infectious diseases inside hospital bays: implications for Covid-19,"Healthcare associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-Covid-19 patients in many hospitals across UK. We use this mathematical model to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-Covid bays, in the context of various scenarios: changes in the number of contacts with infected patients and staff, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (Covid-only) hospital bays.","Moreno Martos, D.; Parcell, B.; Eftimie, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188110v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188110v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
16,Covid 19 and orthopaedic surgery in a large trauma centre in India,"Background - We are in the midst of a pandemic caused by the novel SARS-Cov-2 virus. A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods - A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results - In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT -PCR swab test for COVID - 19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT -PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post - operatively. Conclusions - Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative. All precautions must be taken while performing emergency surgeries. Our algorithm in managing patients has proven to be effective and can be replicated with ease to continue operating and taking care of orthopaedic patients during this pandemic.","Kumar, K.

Average doubling times and case fatality ratios have been quantified as measures of transmission and mortality, respectively, and association analysis performed with twenty variables of socioeconomic vulnerability. Persistent patterns are observed between disease outcome and social inequality, linking poor living conditions to a faster spread, an elderly populace to a slower spread, and both a college education and the presence of medical facilities to low fatality rates.","Dibyachintan, S.; Nandy, P.; Das, K.; Vinjanampathy, S.; Mitra, M.

18,Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases,"A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections. To quantify this phenomenon requires the analysis of the effect of the variance and higher moments of the infection distribution. Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples.We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number R0 is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Safra, S.; Oz, Y.; Rubinstein, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189258v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189258v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,True
19,Association between population density and infection rate suggests the importance of social distancing and travel restriction in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Currently, the 2019-nCoV has spread to most countries of the world. Understanding the environmental factors that affect the spread of the disease COVID-19 infection is critical to stop the spread of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether population density is associated with the infection rate of the COVID-19. Methods: We collected data from official webpages of cities in China and in the US. The data were uploaded on Excel spreadsheets for statistical analyses. We calculated the morbidity and population density of cities and regions in these two countries. We then examined the relationship between the morbidity and other factors. Results: Our analysis indicated that the population density in cities in Hubei province where the COVID-19 was severe was associated with a higher percentage of morbidity, with an r value of 0.62. Similarly, in the US, the density of 51 states and territories is also associated with morbidity from COVID-19 with an r value of 0.55. In contrast, as a control group, there is no association between the morbidity and population density in 33 other regions of China, where the COVID-19 epidemic is well under control. Interestingly, our study also indicated that these associations were not influenced by the first case of COVID-19. The rate of morbidity and the number of days from the first case in the US has no association, with an r value of -0.1288. Conclusions: Population density is positively associated with the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection in the population. Our data support the importance of such as social distancing and travel restriction in the prevention of COVID-19 spread.","Yin, H.; Sun, T.; Yao, L.; Jiao, Y.; Li, M.; Lin, L.; Graff, J.

20,Parents' and guardians' views and experiences of accessing routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: A mixed methods study in England,"Objective: To explore parents' and guardians' views and experiences of accessing National Health Service (NHS) general practices for routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in England. Design: Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19th April and 11th May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27th April and 27th May 2020). Participants: 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. Results: The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their child's risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23rd 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. Conclusion: To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained. To allay concerns about the safety of accessing general practice, practices should communicate the measures being implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Bell, S.

21,Strategies for exiting COVID-19 lockdown for workplace and school: a scoping review protocol,"Objective: The main objectives of this review are to summarise the existing literature and to identify strategies for exiting lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on reopening schools and returning to work. Introduction: After months of strict quarantine, several countries are planning exit strategies to progressively lift social restrictions without giving rise to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Although several strategies have been studied in terms of how and when to relax such stringent constraints, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal strategy for managing the pandemic beyond lockdown. The risks posed by delaying return to work and school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for relevant working sectors and for students from low-income families Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies that focussed on relaxation strategies for lockdown exit among workers and students facing an epidemic /pandemic crisis. Methods: The searches will be conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch, Google Scholar), and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand-searched. In addition, because the topic is new, relevant literature will be checked using daily, updated COVID-19 collections from NCBI (LitCovid) and MedRxiv servers. Studies published in English, German, Spanish, Italian and French will be included, with no limits on publication dates. This review will consider all study designs, regardless of their rigor. The review method will be based on a two-phase approach: a title and abstract screening, and a full-text review performed by two independent researchers. Data will be summarised and categorised, and results will be presented in a tabular/diagrammatic form.","D'Angelo, D.; Coclite, D.; Napoletano, A.; Fauci, A.

22,Efficacy assessment of newly-designed and locally-produced filtering facemasks during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic resulted in shortages of production and test capacity of FFP2-respirators. Such facemasks are required to be worn by healthcare professionals when performing aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 patients. In response to the high demand and short supply, we designed three models of facemasks that are suitable for local production. As these facemasks should meet the requirements of an FFP2-certified facemask, the newly-designed facemasks were tested on the filtration efficiency of the filter material, inward leakage, and breathing resistance with custom-made experimental setups. In these tests, the locally-produced facemasks were benchmarked against a commercial FFP2 facemask. Furthermore, the protective capacity of the facemasks was tested for the first time with coronavirus-loaded aerosols under physiologically relevant conditions. This multidisciplinary effort resulted in the design and production of facemasks that meet the FFP2 requirements, and which can be mass-produced at local production facilities.","Boogaard, B.; Nijssen, J.; Broeren, F.; van den Dobbelsteen, J.; Verhoeven, V.; Pluim, J.; Dekker, S.; Snijder, E.; van Hemert, M.; Herfst, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188185v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188185v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
23,Predicting illness trajectory and hospital resource utilization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients - a nationwide study,"Importance: The spread of COVID-19 has led to a severe strain on hospital capacity in many countries. There is a need for a model to help planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization. Objective: Provide publicly available tools for predicting future hospital-bed utilization given a succinct characterization of the status of currently hospitalized patients and scenarios for future incoming patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study following the day-by-day clinical status of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel from March 1st to May 2nd, 2020. Patient clinical course was modelled with a machine learning approach based on a set of multistate Cox regression-based models with adjustments for right censoring, recurrent events, competing events, left truncation, and time-dependent covariates. The model predicts the patient's entire disease course in terms of clinical states, from which we derive the patient's hospital length-of-stay, length-of-stay in critical state, risk of in-hospital mortality, and overall hospital-bed utilization. Accuracy assessed over 8 cross-validation cohorts of size 330, using per-day Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of predicted hospital utilization over time; and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for individual risk of critical illness and in-hospital mortality, assessed on the first day of hospitalization. We present predicted hospital utilization under hypothetical incoming patient scenarios. Setting: 27 Israeli hospitals. Participants: During the study period, 2,703 confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in Israel for 1 day or more; 28 were excluded due to missing age or sex; the remaining 2,675 patients were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome: per-day estimate of total number of hospitalized patients and number of patients in critical state; secondary outcome: risk of a single patient experiencing critical illness or in-hospital mortality. Results: For random validation samples of 330 patients, the per-day MAEs for total hospital-bed utilization and critical-bed utilization, averaged over 64 days, were 4.72 {+/-} 1.07 and $1.68 {+/-} 0.40 respectively; the AUROCs for prediction of the probabilities of critical illness and in-hospital mortality were 0.88 {+/-} 0.04 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.04, respectively. We further present the impact of several scenarios of patient influx on healthcare system utilization, demonstrating the ability to accurately plan ahead how to allocate healthcare resources. Conclusions and Relevance: We developed a model that, given basic easily obtained data as input, accurately predicts total and critical care hospital utilization. The model enables evaluating the impact of various patient influx scenarios on hospital utilization. Accurate predictions are also given for individual patients' probability of in-hospital mortality and critical illness. We further provide an R software package and a web-application for the model.","Roimi, M.; Gutman, R.; Somer, J.; Ben Arie, A.; Calman, I.; Bar-Lavie, Y.; Ziv, A.; Eytan, D.; Gorfine, M.; Shalit, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20185645v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20185645v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
24,Convalescent plasma as potential therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was high mortality and a lack of effective treatment for critically ill patients. Build on the experience in argentine hemorrhagic fever with convalescent plasma, we incorporated 90 patients into a multicenter study, and 87 were evaluable. We collected 397 donations from 278 convalescent donors. Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0.7-0.8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight. Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective. 77% were male, age 54 (+/-15.6 y/o (range 27-85); body mass index 29.7 +/-; 4,4; hypertension 39% and diabetes 20%; 19.5% had an immunosuppression condition; 23% were healthcare workers. Plasma was administered to 55 patients (63%) on spontaneous breathing with oxygen supplementation (mainly oxygen mask with reservoir bag in 80%), and 32 patients (37%) were infused on mechanical ventilation. The 28-day survival rate was 80%, with 91% in patients infused on spontaneous breathing and 63% in those infused on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0002). There was a significant improvement in the WHO pneumonia clinical scale at 7 and 14 days, and in PaO2 / FiO2, ferritin and LDH, in the week post-infusion.

25,Prognostic accuracy of emergency department triage tools for adults with suspected COVID-19: The PRIEST observational cohort study,"Objectives: The World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the following triage tools: the WHO algorithm, NEWS2, CURB-65, CRB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We analysed data from 20892 adults, of whom 4672 (22.4%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2614 (12.5%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.96 and 0.95 respectively), at the expense of specificity (0.31 and 0.27 respectively). NEWS2 showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion: CURB-65, PMEWS and NEWS2 provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.","Thomas, B.; Goodacre, S.; Lee, E.; Sutton, L.; Loban, A.; Waterhouse, S.; Simmonds, R.; Biggs, K.; Marincowitz, C.; Schutter, J.; Connelly, S.; Sheldon, E.; Hall, J.; Young, E.; Bentley, A.; Challen, K.; Fitzsimmons, C.; Harris, T.; Lecky, F.; Lee, A.; Maconochie, I.; Walter, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20185892v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.20185892v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
26,The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates early serine protease-mediated entry into organoid-derived human airway cells,"After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a second zoonotic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, emerged late 2019 in China and rapidly caused the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a public health crisis of an unprecedented scale. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target.","Mykytyn, A. Z.; Breugem, T.

27,Transmission of allosteric response within the homotrimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike upon recognition of ACE2 receptor by the receptor-binding domain,"The pathogenesis of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates through recognition of ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located at spikes of the virus. Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action of the trimer. Based on our results, we propose the allosteric loop of RBD as a potential drug target.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Bhattacharyya, R.; Sengupta, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,False
28,MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THE SARS-CoV-2 EMERGENCE IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON REGION,"The COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil has demonstrated an important public health impact, as has been observed in the world. In Brazil, the Amazon Region contributed with a large number of cases of COVID-19, especially in the beginning of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. Thus, we describe the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 and the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the Amazon Region. We observe an extensive spread of virus in this Brazilian site. The data on sex, age and symptoms presented by the investigated individuals were similar to what has been observed worldwide. The genomic analysis of the viruses revealed important amino acid changes, including the D614G and the I33T in Spike and ORF6 proteins, respectively. The latter found in strains originating in Brazil. The phylogenetic analyzes demonstrated the circulation of the lineages B.1 and B.1.1, whose circulation in Brazil has already been previous reported. Our data reveals molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazon Region. These findings also reinforce the importance of continuous genomic surveillance this virus with the aim of providing accurate and updated data to understand and map the transmission network of this agent in order to subsidize operational decisions in public health.","dos Santos, M.

29,Mutational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in African Population,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious and pathogenic virus has claimed lot of lives globally since its outbreak in December 2019 posing dire threat on public health, global economy, social and human interaction. At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","Omotoso, O.

30,The link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 in a large population,"BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 infection. In our population we observe major differences in Covid-19 incidence in ethnic groups and genders in each group. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among 4.6 million members of Clalit Health Services (CHS). We collected results from vitamin D tests performed between 2010 and 2019 and used weighted linear regression to assess the relationship between prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 incidence in 200 localities. Additionally, we matched 52,405 infected patients with 524,050 control individuals of the same sex, age, geographical region and used conditional logistic regression to assess the relationship between baseline vitamin D levels, acquisition of vitamin D supplements in the last 4 months, and positive Covid-19. RESULTS We observe a highly significant correlation between prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 incidence, and between female-to-male ratio for severe vitamin D deficiency and female-to-male ratio for Covid-19 incidence in localities (P<0.001). In the matched cohort, we found a significant association between low vitamin D levels and the risk of Covid-19, with the highest risk observed for severe vitamin D deficiency. A significant protective effect was observed for members who acquired liquid vitamin D formulations (drops) in the last 4 months. CONCLUSION In this large observational population study, we show a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 occurrence. After adjustment for baseline characteristics and prior vitamin D levels, acquisition of liquid vitamin D formulations is associated with decreased risk for Covid-19 infection.","Israel, A.; Cicurel, A.

31,Regression Models for Predictions of COVID-19 New Cases and New Deaths Based on May/June Data in Ethiopia,"As the 15 of June 2020, we have 7,984,067 total COVID-19 cases, globally and 435,181 total deaths. Ethiopia was ranked 2nd and 15th in the table by 176 new cases and by 3,521 total new cases from African countries. Then, this study aimed to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on May/June data in Ethiopia using regression model. In this study, I used Pearson correlation analysis and the linear regression model to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on the available data from 12th May to 10th June 2020 in Ethiopia. There was a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 new cases and new deaths with different related variables. In the regression models, the simple linear regression model was a better fit the data of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths than as compared with quadratic and cubic regression models. In the multiple linear regression model, variables such as the number of days, the number of new laboratory tests, and the number of new cases from AA city significantly predicted the COVID-19 new cases. In this model, the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths of COVID-19. The number of days, daily laboratory tests, and new cases from Addis Ababa city significantly predicted new COVID-19 cases, and the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths from COVID-19. According to this analysis, if strong preventions and action are not taken in the country, the predicted values of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths will be 590 and 12 after two months (after 9th of August) from now, respectively. The researcher recommended that the Ethiopia government, Ministry of Health and Addis Ababa city administrative should give more awareness and protections for societies, and they should also open more COVID-19 laboratory testing centers. Generally, the obtained results of this study may help Ethiopian decision-makers put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.","Argawu, A.

32,Modeling COVID-19 Transmission in Africa: Country-wise Projections of Total and Severe Infections Under Different Lockdown Scenarios,"Objectives As of August 24th 2020, there have been 1,084,904 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 24,683 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policy making decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. Design We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown, and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analyzed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and TB. Results In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645,081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa projected peak severe infections increase from 162,977 to 203,261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.","Frost, I.; Craig, J.; Osena, G.; Hauck, S.; Kalanxhi, E.; Schueller, E.; Gatalo, O.; Yany, Y.; Tseng, K.; Lin, G.; Klein, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188102v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188102v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
33,Modeling COVID-19 dynamics in the sixteen West African countries,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused several damages to the world, especially in public health sector. This study considered a simple deterministic SIR (Susceptible- Infectious-Recovered) model to characterize and predict future course of the pandemic in the West African countries. We estimated specific characteristics of the disease's dynamics such as its initial conditions, reproduction numbers, true peak, reported peak with their corresponding times, final epidemic size and time-varying attack ratio. Our findings revealed a relatively low proportion of susceptible individuals in the region and in the different countries (1.2% across West Africa). The detection rate of the disease was also relatively low (0.9% for West Africa as a whole) and < 2% for most countries, except for Cape-Verde (9.5%), Mauritania (5.9%) and Ghana (4.4%). The reproduction number varied between 1.15 (Burkina-Faso) and 4.45 (Niger) and the peak time of the pandemic was between June and July for most countries. Most generally, the reported peak time came a week (7-8 days) after the true peak time. The model predicted 222,100 actual active cases in the region at peak time while the final epidemic size accounted for 0.6% of the West African population (2,526,700 individuals). Results obtained showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has not severely affected West Africa as noticed in other regions of the world, but current control measures and standard operating procedures should be maintained over time to ensure trends observed and even accelerate the declining trend of the pandemic.","Honfo, S.

35,CAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS REOPEN FOR IN-PERSON CLASSES SAFELY AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC?,"Can educational institutions open up safely amid COVID-19? We build an epidemiological model to investigate the strategies necessary for institutions to reopen. The four measures that are most relevant for in-person opening are: (i) wide-spread rapid testing, possibly saliva-based, (ii) enforcement of mask wearing, (iii) social distancing, and (iv) contact tracing. We demonstrate that institutions need to test at a relatively high level (e.g., at least once every week) in the initial phases of reopening. Contact tracing is relatively more important when the positivity rate from random testing is relatively low, which is likely during the initial phases. A Bayesian adaptive testing strategy based on positivity rates can help institutions optimally manage the costs and risks of reopening. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for large-scale organizations. This work is motivated and guided by the SHIELD program of UIUC.","Mukherjee, U.

36,Social capital and psychological distress during Colombian coronavirus disease lockdown,"Introduction. This study aims to establish the association between low capital social (CS) with some indicators of psychological distress. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online questionnaire that evaluated demographic variables, social capital, coronavirus disease perceived stress, depression risk, insomnia risk, and suicide risk. SC was taken as an independent variable, and symptoms indicating psychological distress was handed as dependent variables. Odds ratios (OR) were established with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using binary logistic regression analysis. Results. A group of 700 adults participated in the survey; they were aged between 18 and 76 years (M = 37, SD = 13). Low SC was associated with depression risk (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.34-2.97), elevated suicide risk (OR = 2.62, 95%CI 1.40-4.91) high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.76), and insomnia risk (OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.69-3.47). Conclusions. Low CS was associated with indicators of psychological distress represented in depression risk, elevated suicide risk, high perceived stress related to coronavirus disease and insomnia risk. SC is a community social resource that could help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus disease quarantine amidst the Colombian population's psychological health. It is necessary to deepen the SC role in psychological well-being during and after the coronavirus disease epidemic.","Caballero-Dominguez, C.

37,The dichotomous and incomplete adaptive immunity in COVID-19,"The adaptive immunity that protects patients from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is not well characterized. In particular, the asymptomatic patients have been found to induce weak and transient SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; meanwhile, the protective immunity that guide the recovery of these asymptomatic patients is also not well studied. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 49 patients with other disease severity (mild, n=10, moderate, n=32, severe, n=7) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and long-term humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (TFH) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated TFH responses; however, the virus-specific TH1 and CD8+ T cells were minimally induced in these patients. These results therefore uncovered the protective immunity in asymptomatic patients and revealed the strikingly dichotomous and unbalanced humoral and cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, providing important insights into rational design of COVID-19 vaccines.","Gao, L.; Zhou, J.; Yang, S.; Chen, X.; Yang, Y.; Li, R.; Pan, Z.; Zhao, J.; Li, Z.; Huang, Q.; Tang, J.; Hu, L.; Liu, P.; Zhang, G.; Chen, Y.; Ye, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20187435v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20187435v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
38,The timing of COVID-19 transmission,"The timing of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is a critical factor to understand the epidemic trajectory and the impact of isolation, contact tracing and other non- pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 epidemics. We examined the distribution of transmission events with respect to exposure and onset of symptoms. We show that for symptomatic individuals, the timing of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is more strongly linked to the onset of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 than to the time since infection. We found that it was approximately centered and symmetric around the onset of symptoms, with three quarters of events occurring in the window from 2-3 days before to 2-3 days after. However, we caution against overinterpretation of the right tail of the distribution, due to its dependence on behavioural factors and interventions. We also found that the pre-symptomatic infectious period extended further back in time for individuals with longer incubation periods. This strongly suggests that information about when a case was infected should be collected where possible, in order to assess how far into the past their contacts should be traced. Overall, the fraction of transmission from strictly pre-symptomatic infections was high (41%; 95%CI 31-50%), which limits the efficacy of symptom-based interventions, and the large fraction of transmissions (35%; 95%CI 26-45%) that occur on the same day or the day after onset of symptoms underlines the critical importance of individuals distancing themselves from others as soon as they notice any symptoms, even if they are mild. Rapid or at-home testing and contextual risk information would greatly facilitate efficient early isolation.","Ferretti, L.; Ledda, A.; Wymant, C.; Zhao, L.; Ledda, V.; Abeler- Dorner, L.; Kendall, M.; Nurtay, A.; Cheng, H.-Y.; Ng, T.-C.; Lin, H.-H.; Hinch, R.; Masel, J.; Kilpatrick, A.

39,The association between COVID-19 and preterm delivery: A cohort study with a multivariate analysis,"Structured abstract Objective: To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2, the cause of COVID 19 disease) exposure in pregnancy, compared to non exposure, is associated with infection related obstetric morbidity. Design and setting: Throughout Spain, 45 hospitals took part in the universal screening of pregnant women going into labour using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID 19 since late March 2020. Methods: The cohort of exposed and unexposed pregnancies was followed up until 6 weeks postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of COVID 19 exposure, compared to non exposure, with infection related obstetric outcomes. Main outcome measures: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Results: In the cohort of 1,009 screened pregnancies, 246 were COVID 19 positive. Compared to non exposure, COVID 19 exposure increased the odds of preterm birth (34 vs 51, 13.8% vs 6.7%, aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.32 3.36, p=0.002), premature rupture of membranes at term (39 vs 75, % vs 9.8%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11 2.57, p=0.013) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (23 vs 18, 9.3% vs 2.4%, aOR 4.62, 95% CI 2.43 8.94, p<0.001). Conclusion: This first prospective cohort study demonstrated that pregnant women infected with SARS CoV 2 have more infection related obstetric morbidity. This hypothesis merits evaluation of a causal association in further research.","SPANISH OBSTETRIC EMERGENCY GROUP,; Martinez Perez, O.; Prats Rodriguez, P.; Muner Hernandez, M.; Encinas Pardilla, M.

40,COVID-19 superspreading in cities versus the countryside,"So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by an initial rapid rise in new cases followed by a peak and a more erratic behaviour that varies between regions. This is not easy to reproduce with traditional SIR models, which predict a more symmetric epidemic. Here, we argue that superspreaders and population heterogeneity are the core factors explaining this discrepancy. We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population.We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections. This suggests that mitigation strategies should include restrictions on venues where people meet a largenumber of strangers. Furthermore, mitigating the epidemic in cities and in the countryside may require different levels of restrictions.","Eilersen, A.; Sneppen, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188359v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
41,Is climate a curse or a bless in the Covid-19 virus fighting?,"Faced with the global pandemic of Covid-19, we need to better understand the links between meteorological factors and the virus and investigate the existence of potential seasonal patterns. In the vein of a recent empirical literature, we reassess the impact of weather factors on Covid-19 daily cases in a panel of advanced and emerging countries between January the first and 28th May 2020. We consider 5 different meteorological factors and go further previous studies. In addition, we give a short-run and medium/long-run time perspective of the dramatic outcomes of the pandemic by both considering infected people (short-run) and fatalities (long-run). Our results reveal that the choice of delays and time perspective of the effects of climatic factors on the virus are crucial as well as Covid-19 outcomes can explain the discrepancies in the previous literature. For the first time, we use a dynamic panel model and consider two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: 1) direct/physical factors related to the survivals and durability dynamics of the virus in surfaces and outdoors and 2) an indirect factor through human behaviors and individual mobility - walking or driving outdoors - to capture the impact of climate on social distancing and thus on Covid-19 outcomes. Our model is estimated emph{per se} two different estimators and persistence, delays in patterns, nonlinearities and numerous specifications changes are taken into account with many robustness checks. Our work reveal that temperatures and, more interestingly, solar radiation - that has been clearly undervalued in previous studies - are significant climatic drivers on Covid-19 outbreak. Indirect effects through human behaviors ie interrelationships between climatic variables and people mobility are significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Since climate is per se purely exogenous, climate tend to strengthen the effect of mobility on virus spread. The net effect from climate on Covid-19 outbreak will thus result from the direct negative effect of climatic variables and from the indirect effect due to the interaction between mobility and them. Direct negative effects from climatic factors on Covid-19 outcomes - when they are significant - are partly compensated by positive indirect effects through human mobility. Suitable control policies should be implemented to control the mobility and social distancing. \","DAMETTE, O.; Mathonnat, C.; Goutte, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20182998v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20182998v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True
42,Trans-ethnic analysis reveals genetic and non-genetic associations with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity,"COVID-19 presents with a wide range of severity, from asymptomatic in some individuals to fatal in others. Based on a study of over one million 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and non-genetic associations with testing positive for COVID-19, respiratory symptoms, and hospitalization. Risk factors for hospitalization include advancing age, male sex, elevated body mass index, lower socio-economic status, non-European ancestry, and pre-existing cardio-metabolic and respiratory conditions. Using trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies, we identify a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chr3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. While non-European ancestry was found to be a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for socio-demographics and pre-existing health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain differences between populations in terms of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shelton, J.

43,"Contact tracing efficiency, transmission heterogeneity, and accelerating COVID-19 epidemics","Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase it takes longer to reach each cases' contacts, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between cases, delays, and participation and the pathogen reproductive number Rt. We also examined implications for infection dynamics using a stochastic compartment model of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increases sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections is more complicated). We also found that contact tracing quickly becomes ineffective in reducing Rt with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, we found that when cases are low, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, in which a small fraction of infections often give rise to most of transmission. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also emphasize the value of easy access, high testing capacity and rapid turn-around of testing results, as well as outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic infections to be tested immediately after symptom onset. An efficient and adaptive public health capacity strategy can allow for increased economic activity and should be employed in the current and future pandemics.","Gardner, B.; Kilpatrick, A.

44,"Health professionals practice and associated factors towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 pandemic in public health facilities of Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","Abstract Introduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease. Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association was declared at P<0.05. Results In this study, 35{middle dot}3% (95%CI: 30{middle dot}7%, 39{middle dot}8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68{middle dot}9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67{middle dot}3%), and use facemask in crowds (56{middle dot}8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR=1{middle dot}84, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR=2{middle dot}02, 95%CI: 1{middle dot}02, 3{middle dot}18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 were factors showed signification association with the practice. Conclusions The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery.","Mersha, A.; Shibiru, S.; Girma, M.; Ayele, G.; Bante, A.; Kassa, M.; Abebe, S.; Shewangizaw, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.05.20188805v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,True

However, clinical manifestations and outcomes differ significantly among COVID-19 patients, ranging from asymptomatic to extremely severe, and it remains unclear what drives these disparities. Here, we studied 159 hospitalized Italian patients with pneumonia from the NIAID-NCI COVID-19 Consortium using a phage-display method to characterize circulating antibodies binding to 93,904 viral peptides encoded by 1,276 strains of human viruses. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a marked increase in individual's immune memory antibody repertoires linked to trajectories of disease severity from the longitudinal analysis also including anti-spike protein antibodies. By applying a machine-learning-based strategy, we developed a viral exposure signature predictive of COVID-19-related disease severity linked to patient survival. These results provide a basis for understanding the roles of memory B-cell repertoires in COVID-19-related symptoms as well as a predictive tool for monitoring its clinical severity.","Wang, L.; Candia, J.; Ma, L.; Zhao, Y.; Imberti, L.; Sottini, A.; Dobbs, K.; NIAID-NCI COVID Consortium,; Lisco, A.; Sereti, I.; Su, H.

46,COVID-19 Preprints and Their Publishing Rate: An Improved Method,"Context: As the COVID-19 pandemic persists around the world, the scientific community continues to produce and circulate knowledge on the deadly disease at an unprecedented rate. During the early stage of the pandemic, preprints represented nearly 40% of all English-language COVID-19 scientific corpus (6, 000+ preprints | 16, 000+ articles). As of mid-August 2020, that proportion dropped to around 28% (13, 000+ preprints | 49, 000+ articles). Nevertheless, preprint servers remain a key engine in the efficient dissemination of scientific work on this infectious disease. But, giving the uncertified nature of the scientific manuscripts curated on preprint repositories, their integration to the global ecosystem of scientific communication is not without creating serious tensions. This is especially the case for biomedical knowledge since the dissemination of bad science can have widespread societal consequences. Scope: In this paper, I propose a robust method that will allow the repeated monitoring and measuring of COVID-19 preprint's publication rate. I also introduce a new API called Upload-or-Perish. It is a micro-API service that enables a client to query a specific preprint manuscript's publication status and associated meta-data using a unique ID. This tool is in active development. Data: I use Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to calculate COVID-19 preprint corpus' conversion rate to peer-reviewed articles. CORD-19 dataset includes preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. Methods: I utilize conditional fuzzy logic on article titles to determine if a preprint has a published counterpart version in the database. My approach is an important departure from previous studies that rely exclusively on bioRxiv API to ascertain preprints' publication status. This is problematic since the level of false positives in bioRxiv metadata could be as high as 37%. Findings: My analysis reveals that around 15% of COVID-19 preprint manuscripts in CORD-19 dataset that were uploaded on from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv between January and early August 2020 were published in a peer-reviewed venue. When compared to the most recent measure available, this represents a two-fold increase in a period of two months.

48,Cooperative efforts on developing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19,"Health organizations have always sought partnership to join competencies in innovation, even with fierce competition in this sector. In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model.","Basso, F. G.; de Paulo, A.

50,Notable sequence homology of the ORF10 protein introspects the architecture of SARS-COV-2,"The global public health is endangered due to COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having similar pathology to MERS and SARS-CoV, the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely lower than 1%. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be uniquely characterized by the accessory protein ORF10, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids length each, across various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes. In this study, all missense mutations found in sequence databases were examined across twnety-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants that could possibly alter viral pathogenicity. Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Hassan, S.

51,New insights into nCOVID-19 binding domain and its cellular receptors,"nCOVID-19 virus makes cellular entry using its spike protein protruding out on its surface. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as a receptor that mediates the viral entry by binding with the receptor binding motif of spike protein. In the present study, we elucidate the significance of N-terminal domain of spike protein in spike-receptor interactions. Recent clinical reports indicate a link between nCOVID-19 infections with patient comorbidities. The underlying reason behind this relationship is not clear. Using molecular docking, we study the affinity of the nCOVID-19 spike protein with cell receptors overexpressed under disease conditions. Our results suggest that certain cell receptors such as DC/L-SIGN, DPP4, IL22R and ephrin receptors could act as potential receptors for the spike protein. The receptor binding domain of nCOVID-19 is more flexible than that of SARS-COV and has a high propensity to undergo phase separation. Higher flexibility of nCOVID-19 receptor binding domain might enable it to bind multiple receptor partners. Further experimental work on the association of these receptors with spike protein may help us to explain the severity of nCOVID-19 infection in patients with comorbidities.","Garg, A.; Kumar, G.; Sinha, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,,False
52,"Computationally validated SARS-CoV-2 CTL and HTL Multi-Patch Vaccines designed by reverse epitomics approach, shows potential to cover large ethnically distributed human population worldwide","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodologyA novel reverse epitomics approach, ""overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches"" method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as ""Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches"", for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs.

ResultsWe identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line.

ConclusionHighly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.

Here we investigate the immunogenicity of a range of candidate adenovirusbased vaccines, expressing full or partial sequences of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, in mice. We demonstrate that, compared to expression of the S1 domain or a stabilized spike antigen, the full length, wild-type spike antigen induces significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in the periphery and in the lungs, when the vaccine is administered mucosally. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by this leading vaccine candidate at low and high doses.

The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. Results: 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in SUS were predominantly male (56.5%), with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (STD=6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The chances of hospital death among men were 16.8% higher than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher chance of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states had a higher risk of hospital death from COVID-19, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro. The chances of hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants and being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. Conclusion: There was wide variation in hospital COVID-19 mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care.","de Andrade, C.

57,Assessment of COVID-19 Pandemic in Nepal: A Lockdown Scenario Analysis,"The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21 July 2020, prohibiting domestic and international travels, border closures and closure of non-essential services. We collated the data provided by the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population and assessed scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal during the lockdown period. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported total 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions to manage potential COVID-19 outbreak after easing lockdown.","Parajuli, K.

58,Swab pooling for large-scale RT-qPCR screening of SARS-CoV-2,"Pool testing has been proposed as an alternative for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, dilution factors proportional to the number of pooled samples have been a source of major concern regarding its diagnostic performance. Further, sample pooling can lead to increased laboratory workload and operational complexity. Therefore, pooling strategies that minimize sample dilution, loss of sensitivity, and laboratory overload are needed to allow reliable and large-scale screenings of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a pooling procedure in which nasopharyngeal swabs are pooled together at the time of sample collection (swab pooling), decreasing laboratory manipulation and minimizing dilution of the viral RNA present in the samples. Paired analysis of pooled and individual samples from 613 patients revealed 94 positive individual tests. Having individual testing as a reference, no false-positives or false-negatives were observed for swab pooling. A Bayesian model estimated a sensitivity of 99% (Cr.I. 96.9% to 100%) and a specificity of 99.8% (Cr.I. 99.4% to 100%) for the swab pooling procedure. Data from additional 18,922 patients screened with swab pooling were included for further quantitative analysis. Mean Cq differences between individual and corresponding pool samples ranged from 0.1 Cq (Cr.I. -0.98 to 1.17) to 2.09 Cq (Cr.I. 1.24 to 2.94). Overall, 19,535 asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients were screened using 4,400 RT-qPCR assays, resulting in 246 positive patients (positivity rate 1.26%). This corresponds to an increase of 4.4 times in laboratory capacity and a reduction of 77% in required tests. Finally, these data demonstrate that swab pooling can significantly minimize sample dilution and sensitivity issues commonly seen in its traditional counterpart. Therefore, swab pooling represents a major alternative for reliable and large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 in low prevalence populations.","Christoff, A. P.; Cruz, G. N. F.; Sereia, A. F.

59,Immunological characteristics govern the changing severity of COVID-19 during the transition to endemicity,"As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccination, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which separates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control measures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable groups.","Lavine, J.

60,Viable virus aerosol propagation by PAP circuit leak and mitigation with a ventilated patient hood: a model for improving health care worker safety in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests patients auto-emit aerosols containing viable respiratory viruses. These aerosols could be further propagated when patients undergo certain treatments including continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. This study aimed to assess the degree of viable virus propagated from mask leak in a PAP circuit and the mitigation of virus propagation by an air filter combined with a plastic canopy. Methods: Bacteriophage PhiX174 (108copies/mL) was nebulised into a custom PAP circuit within a non-vented clinical room. Mask leak was systematically varied to allow 0, 7, 21, 28 and 42 L/min at the mask interface. Plates containing Escherichia coli host assessed the degree of viable virus (via plaque forming unit) settling on surfaces around the room. In order to contain virus spread, the efficacy of a simple, low-cost ventilated headboard, created from a plastic tarpaulin hood and a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was tested. Findings: Increasing mask leak was associated with virus contamination in a dose response manner (chisquared=58.24, df=4, p<0.001). Clinically relevant levels of leak (>21 L/min) were associated with virus counts equivalent to using PAP with a standard vented mask. The highest frequency of viruses was detected on surfaces 1m from the leak source, however, viable viruses were recorded on all plates (up to 3.86m from source). A plastic hood with HEPA filtration significantly reduced viable viruses on all plates. HEPA exchange rates of 170 and 470m3/hr eradicated all evidence of virus contamination. Interpretation: Mask leak from PAP circuits may be a major source of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Subclinical levels of leak should be treated as an infectious risk. Cheap and low-cost patient hoods with HEPA filtration are an effective countermeasure.","Landry, S.

61,SARS-CoV-2 infection paralyzes cytotoxic and metabolic functions of immune cells,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 infectious disease outbreak, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in 10 acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. Our findings reveal patients who suffer from an over activation of the immune system, a change of composition in infusion/intravenous fluids during infection with the aim to lower blood levels of glucose, glutamate, acetate and formate could avoid a life-threatening cytokine storm. In summary, our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disrupted CD8+ T cytotoxic functions and changes the overall metabolic functions of immune cells.","Singh, Y.; Trautwein, C.; Fendel, R.; Krickeberg, N.; Held, J.; Kreidenweiss, A.; Berezhnoy, G.; Bissinger, R.; Ossowski, S.; Salker, M.

63,Genomic diversity and evolution of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in France from 309 COVID-19-infected patients,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pandemic of viral pneumonia. The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion ({Delta}21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus.

64,"Preliminary report of preclinical efficacy and safety analysis of gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, SK-01 version 1 and OZG-3861 version 1","The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no coronavirus vaccine in the market due to the novelty of this virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. Our candidate OZG-3861 version 1 (V1) is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1) is the GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine candidate. We applied the candidates intradermal to BALB/c mice to assess the toxicity and immunogenicity of the OZG-3861 V1 and SK-01 V1. Here, we report our preliminary results in vaccinated mice. When considered in terms of T and B cell responses, it was observed that especially the vaccine models containing GM-CSF as an adjuvant caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature. Another finding showed that the presence of adjuvant is more important in T cell response rather than B cell. The vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study encouraged us to start the challenge test using infective SARS-CoV-2 viruses and our second version of gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates in humanized ACE2+ mice.","SIR KARAKUS, G.; Tastan, C.; Dilek Kancagi, D.; Yurtsever, B.; Tumentemur, G.; Demir, S.; Turan, R.

65,Monoclonal Antibodies Capable of Binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Motif Specifically Prevent GM-CSF Induction.,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm"", and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

66,Clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data reveals population structure of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been spreading rapidly and across the globe since first being reported in December 2019. To understand the evolutionary trajectory of the coronavirus, phylogenetic analysis is needed to study the population structure of SARS-CoV-2. As sequencing data worldwide is accruing rapidly, grouping them into clusters helps to organize the landscape of population structures. To effectively group these data, computational methodologies are needed to provide more productive and robust solutions for clustering. In this study, using the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the viral sequences as input features, we utilized three clustering algorithms, namely K-means, hierarchical clustering and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies to partition the viral sequences into six major clusters. Comparison of the three clustering results reveals that the three methods produced highly consistent results, but K-means performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances among the three methods. The partition of the viral sequences revealed that the six clusters differed in their geographical distributions. Using comprehensive approaches to compare the diversity and selective pressure across the clusters, we discovered a high genetic diversity between the clusters. Based on characteristics of the mutation profiles in each cluster along with their geographical distributions and evolutionary histories, we identified the extent of molecular divergence within and between the clusters. The identification of the mutations that are strongly associated with clusters have potential implications for diagnosis and pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, the clustering method will enable further study of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.","Li, Y.; Liu, Q.; Luo, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1,2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,False

Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1.

68,A SARS-CoV-2 - host proximity interactome,"Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling.

There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes.

Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2.

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by {gamma}S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment.

72,Development of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Specific Monoclonal Antibodies,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions in every society around the world. To help fight COVID-19, new molecular tools specifically targeting critical components of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is a major component of the viral replication processes, integral to viral particle assembly, and is a major diagnostic marker for infection and immune protection. Currently available antibody reagents targeting the nucleocapsid protein were primarily developed against the related SARS-CoV virus and are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, in this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies were tested in ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. The variable regions from the heavy and light chains from five select clones were cloned and sequenced, and preliminary epitope mapping of the sequenced clones was performed. Overall, the new antibody reagents described here will be of significant value in the fight against COVID-19.","Terry, J. S.; Anderson, L. B.; Scherman, M. S.; McAlister, C.

73,Boosting the analysis of protein interfaces with Multiple Interface String Alignment: illustration on the spikes of coronaviruses,"We introduce Multiple Interface String Alignment (MISA), a visualization tool to display coherently various sequence and structure based statistics at protein-protein interfaces (SSE elements, buried surface area, {Delta}ASA, B factor values, etc). The amino-acids supporting these annotations are obtained from Voronoi interface models. The benefit of MISA is to collate annotated sequences of (homologous) chains found in different biological contexts i.e. bound with different partners or unbound. The aggregated views MISA/SSE, MISA/BSA, MISA/{Delta} ASAetc make it trivial to identify commonalities and differences between chains, to infer key interface residues, and to understand where conformational changes occur upon binding. As such, they should prove of key relevance for knowledge based annotations of protein databases such as the Protein Data Bank.

Illustrations are provided on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronaviruses, in complex with their cognate partner or (neutralizing) antibodies. MISA computed with a minimal number of structures complement and enrich findings previously reported.

74,A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, M.

75,Phylo-geo-network and haplogroup analysis of 611 novel Coronavirus (nCov-2019) genomes from India,"The novel Coronavirus from Wuhan China discovered in December 2019 (nCOV-2019) has since developed into a global epidemic with major concerns about the possibility of the virus evolving into something even more sinister. In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 genomes full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

76,"The discovery of gene mutations making SARS-CoV-2 well adapted for humans: host-genome similarity analysis of 2594 genomes from China, the USA and Europe","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded virus approximately 30 kb in length, causes the ongoing novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","Sun, W.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.280727v1?rss=1,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,,False
77,A Single Dose of Self-Transcribing and Replicating RNA Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Produces Protective Adaptive Immunity In Mice,"A self-transcribing and replicating RNA (STARR) based vaccine (LUNAR(R)-COV19) has been developed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 g and 10 g doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

78,Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness and neutralization susceptibility,"A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an ""up"" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.

ImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.","Plante, J. A.; Liu, Y.; Liu, J.; Xia, H.; Johnson, B.

However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.","Tan, H.-X.; Juno, J. A.; Lee, W.

80,SARS-CoV-2 causes severe alveolar inflammation and barrier dysfunction,"Infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to mild to severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with systemic symptoms. Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.

To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.

Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","Deinhardt-Emmer, S.; Böttcher, S.; Häring, C.; Giebeler, L.; Henke, A.; Zell, R.; Hornung, F.; Brandt, C.; Marquet, M.; Mosig, A.

81,Structural Variants in SARS-CoV-2 Occur at Template-Switching Hotspots,"The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in ""arms"" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.","Chrisman, B.; Paskov, K.; Stockham, N.; Tabatabaei, K.; Jung, J.-Y.; Washington, P.; Varma, M.; Woo Sun, M.; Maleki, S.; Wall, D.

82,An intestinal cell type in zebrafish is the nexus for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contributes to COVID-19 comorbidities,"People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

83,Induction of a regulatory myeloid program in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19,"A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis1. To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5-8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reyes, M.; Filbin, M.

84,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with a human intestine-on-chip device,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.","Guo, Y.; Luo, R.; Wang, Y.; Deng, P.; Zhang, M.; Wang, P.; Zhang, X.; Cui, K.; Tao, T.; Li, Z.; Chen, W.; Zheng, Y.; Qin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.277780v1?rss=1,2020-09-02,2020-09-02,,False
85,Characterization of neutralizing versus binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 recovered individuals from India,"India is one of the countries most affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Characterization of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including immunoglobulin isotype usage, neutralizing activity and memory B cell generation, is necessary to provide critical insights on the formation of immune memory in Indian subjects. In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses, neutralization of live virus, and RBD-specific memory B cell responses in pre-pandemic healthy versus convalescent COVID-19 individuals from India. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the formation of humoral and B cell memory post COVID-19 recovery. While a vast majority (38/42, 90.47%) of COVID-19 recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG responses, only half of them had appreciable neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers correlated with these neutralizing antibody titers as well as with RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies. In contrast, IgG titers measured against SARS-CoV-2 whole virus preparation, which includes responses to additional viral proteins besides RBD, did not show robust correlation. Our results suggest that assessing RBD-specific IgG titers can serve as a surrogate assay to determine the neutralizing antibody response. These observations have timely implications for identifying potential plasma therapy donors based on RBD-specific IgG in resource-limited settings where routine performance of neutralization assays remains a challenge.

ImportanceOur study provides an understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies, binding antibodies and memory B cells in COVID-19 convalescent subjects from India. Our study highlights that PCR-confirmed convalescent COVID-19 individuals develop SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which correlate strongly with their neutralizing antibody titers. RBD-specific IgG titers, thus, can serve as a valuable surrogate measurement for neutralizing antibody responses.

86,"Engineered Trimeric ACE2 Binds and Locks ""Three-up"" Spike Protein to Potently Inhibit SARS-CoVs and Mutants","SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE-2, which binds the spike protein with moderate affinity. Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2 for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2.

T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.","Guo, L.; Bi, W.; Wang, X.; Xu, W.; Yan, R.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, K.; Li, Y.; Zhang, M.; Bao, X.; Cai, X.; Li, Y.; Qu, D.; Jiang, S.; Xie, Y.; Zhou, Q.; Lu, L.; Dang, B.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.274704v1?rss=1,2020-09-01,2020-09-01,,False
87,Drug repurposing screen identifies masitinib as a 3CLpro inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Drayman, N.; Jones, K.

88,Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms,"The zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. Animal experiments have shown that non-human primates, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits and bats can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with three big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. We also describe the first animal to human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms.

89,A versatile reporter system to monitor virus infected cells and its application to dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, F.; Neufeldt, C.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are responsible for viral polyprotein cleavage - a process crucial for viral survival and replication. Recently it was shown that 2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen), an organoselenium anti-inflammatory small-molecule drug, is a potent, covalent inhibitor of both the proteases and its potency was evaluated in enzymatic and anti-viral assays. In this study, we screened a collection of 23 ebselen derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro inhibitors. Our studies revealed that ebselen derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the proteases. We identified three PLpro and four Mpro inhibitors superior to ebselen.

Given literature suggesting a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and diabetes induction, we examined pancreatic expression of the key molecule for SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Specifically, we analyzed five public scRNAseq pancreas datasets and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunolocalization for ACE2 with extensive reagent validation on normal human pancreatic tissues across the lifespan, as well as those from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated pancreatic expression of ACE2 is prominent in pancreatic ductal epithelium and the microvasculature, with rare endocrine cell expression of this molecule. Pancreata from COVID-19 patients demonstrated multiple thrombotic lesions with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein expression primarily limited to ducts. SARS-CoV-2 infection of pancreatic endocrine cells, via ACE2, appears an unlikely central pathogenic feature of COVID-19 as it relates to diabetes.","Kusmartseva, I.; Wu, W.; Syed, F.; van der Heide, V.; Jorgensen, M.; Joseph, P.; Tang, X.; Candelario-Jalil, E.; Yang, C.; Nick, H.; Harbert, J.; Posgai, A.

92,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are Expressed in the Pancreas but Not in Islet Endocrine Cells,"Summary/AbstractReports of new-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with COVID-19 have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is directly cytotoxic to pancreatic islet {beta} cells. This model would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells via cell surface co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the putative receptor and effector protease, respectively. To define ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the human pancreas, we examined six transcriptional datasets from primary human islet cells and assessed protein expression by immunofluorescence in pancreata from donors with and without diabetes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts were low or undetectable in pancreatic islet endocrine cells as determined by bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and neither protein was detected in  or {beta} cells from any of these donors. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in the islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and also found in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. The absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in islet endocrine cells makes it unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 directly affects pancreatic islet {beta} cells.","Coate, K.

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning.

94,Methylene Blue Inhibits In Vitro the SARS-CoV-2 Spike - ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction - A Mechanism That Can Contribute to Its Antiviral Activity Against COVID-19,"Due to our interest in the chemical space of organic dyes to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we initiated a screen of such compounds to assess their inhibitory activity against the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cognate receptor ACE2, which is the first critical step initiating the viral attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this, we found that methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine compound approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications (including the inactivation of viruses in blood products prior to transfusion when activated by light), inhibits this interaction. We confirmed that it does so in a concentration-dependent manner with a low micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 3 M) in our protein-based ELISA-type setup, while chloroquine, siramesine, and suramin showed no inhibitory activity in this assay. Erythrosine B, which we have shown before to be a promiscuous SMI of PPIs, also inhibited this interaction with an activity similar, possibly slightly higher, than those found for it for other PPIs. This PPI inhibitory activity of methylene blue could contribute to its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 even in the absence of light by blocking its attachment to ACE2-expressing cells and making this inexpensive and widely available drug potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as an oral or inhaled medication.","Bojadzic, D.; Alcazar, O.; Buchwald, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.273441v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,False
95,A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses,"There is dire need for an effective and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to tackle the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","Tan, T.

96,"SARS-CoV-2 infects human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, impairing electrical and mechanical function","Global health has been threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)1. Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease2-4. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities3,5-9. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. Long-term cardiac complications might be possible sequelae in patients who recover from this illness.","Marchiano, S.; Hsiang, T.-Y.; Higashi, T.; Kanna, A.; Reinecke, H.; Yang, X.; Pabon, L.; Sniadecki, N.

99,Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells and genomic mutational analysis of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","Friedman, N.; Jacob-Hirsch, J.; Drori, Y.; Eyal, E.; Kol, N.; Nayshool, O.; Mendelson, E.; Rechavi, G.; Mandelboim, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
