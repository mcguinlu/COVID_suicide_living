0,Diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-rays Using Combined CNN-RNN Architecture with Transfer Learning,"The confrontation of COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the promising challenges of the world healthcare. Accurate and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases is essential for correct medical treatment to control this pandemic. Compared with the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, chest radiography imaging techniques are shown to be more effective to detect coronavirus. For the limitation of available medical images, transfer learning is better suited to classify patterns in medical images. This paper presents a combined architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The deep transfer techniques used in this experiment are VGG19, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and Inception-ResNetV2. CNN is used to extract complex features from samples and classified them using RNN. The VGG19-RNN architecture achieved the best performance among all the networks in terms of accuracy and computational time in our experiments. Finally, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize class-specific regions of images that are responsible to make decision. The system achieved promising results compared to other existing systems and might be validated in the future when more samples would be available. The experiment demonstrated a good alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 for medical staff.","Islam, M. M.; Islam, M.

1,Correction of Daily Positivity Rates for contribution of various test protocols being used in a pandemic.,"Daily positivity rates (DPR) are a popular metric to judge the prevalence of an infection in the population and the testing response to it as a single number. It has been widely implicated in predicting future course of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic in India. With increasing use of multiple testing protocols with varying sensitivity and specificity in various proportions, the naive calculation loses meaning particularly during comparison between states/countries with large daily variations in contribution of different testing protocols to the testing response. We propose an adjustment to the naive DPR based on the testing parameters and the relative proportional use of each such protocol. Such a correction has become essential for comparing testing response of Indian states from Jun 2020 to Aug 2020 because of steep variations in testing protocol in certain states.","Bansal, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181347v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.25.20181347v1?rss=1,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,,True
2,Disease-dependent interaction policies to support health and economic outcomes during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have mitigated the spread of Covid-19 in certain counties.However, the indiscriminate nature of mitigation - applying to all individuals irrespective of disease status - has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. Here, we explore how to leverage the increasing reliability and scale of both molecular and serological tests to balance transmission risks with economic costs involved in responding to Covid-19 epidemics. First, we introduce an optimal control approach that identifies personalized interaction rates according to an individual's test status; such that infected individuals isolate, recovered individuals can elevate their interactions, and activity of susceptible individuals varies over time. Critically, the extent to which susceptible individuals can return to work depends strongly on isolation efficiency. As we show, optimal control policies can yield mitigation policies with similar infection rates to total shutdown but lower socioeconomic costs. However, optimal control policies can be fragile given mis-specification of parameters or mis-estimation of the current disease state. Hence, we leverage insights from the optimal control solutions and propose a feedback control approach based on monitoring of the epidemic state. We utilize genetic algorithms to identify a `switching' policy such that susceptible individuals (both PCR and serological test negative) return to work after lockdowns insofar as recovered fraction is much higher than the circulating infected prevalence. This feedback control policy exhibits similar performance results to optimal control, but with greater robustness to uncertainty. Overall, our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","Li, G.; Shivam, S.; Hochberg, M.

3,"SARS-CoV-2 infects human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, impairing electrical and mechanical function","Global health has been threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Although considered primarily a respiratory infection, many COVID-19 patients also suffer severe cardiovascular disease. Improving patient care critically relies on understanding if cardiovascular pathology is caused directly by viral infection of cardiac cells or indirectly via systemic inflammation and/or coagulation abnormalities. Here we examine the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) and three-dimensional engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs). We observe that hPSC-CMs express the viral receptor ACE2 and other viral processing factors, and that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects and replicates within hPSC-CMs, resulting in rapid cell death. Moreover, infected hPSC-CMs show a progressive impairment in both electrophysiological and contractile properties. Thus, COVID-19-related cardiac symptoms likely result from a direct cardiotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. Long-term cardiac complications might be possible sequelae in patients who recover from this illness.","Marchiano, S.; Hsiang, T.-Y.; Higashi, T.; Kanna, A.; Reinecke, H.; Yang, X.; Pabon, L.; Sniadecki, N.

4,Structural classification of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain suggests vaccine and therapeutic strategies,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to up RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both up and down RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize up and down RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only up RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent down RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, C.

5,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces,"We report the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces under indoor, summer and spring/fall conditions. The virus was more stable under the spring/fall condition with virus half-lives ranging from 17.11 to 31.82 hours, whereas under indoor and summer conditions the virus half-lives were 3.5-11.33 and 2.54-5.58 hours, respectively.","Kwon, T.; Gaudreault, N.

6,Structure-Altering Mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Frame Shifting RNA Element,"With the rapid rate of Covid-19 infections and deaths, treatments and cures besides hand washing, social distancing, masks, isolation, and quarantines are urgently needed. The treatments and vaccines rely on the basic biophysics of the complex viral apparatus. While proteins are serving as main drug and vaccine targets, therapeutic approaches targeting the 30,000 nucleotide RNA viral genome form important complementary approaches. Indeed, the high conservation of the viral genome, its close evolutionary relationship to other viruses, and the rise of gene editing and RNA-based vaccines all argue for a focus on the RNA agent itself. One of the key steps in the viral replication cycle inside host cells is the ribosomal frameshifting required for translation of overlapping open reading frames. The frameshifting element (FSE), one of three highly conserved regions of coronaviruses, includes an RNA pseudoknot considered essential for this ribosomal switching. In this work, we apply our graph-theory-based framework for representing RNA secondary structures, ""RAG"" (RNA-As Graphs), to alter key structural features of the FSE of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, using RAG machinery of genetic algorithms for inverse folding adapted for RNA structures with pseudoknots, we computationally predict minimal mutations that destroy a structurally-important stem and/or the pseudoknot of the FSE, potentially dismantling the virus against translation of the polyproteins. Additionally, our microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of mutant structures indicate relatively stable secondary structures. These findings not only advance our computational design of RNAs containing pseudoknots; they pinpoint to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as targets for anti-viral drugs and gene editing approaches.","Schlick, T.; Zhu, Q.; Jain, S.; Yan, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.271965v1?rss=1,2020-08-30,2020-08-30,,False
7,"The global landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, variants, and haplotypes in 2019nCoVR","On 22 January 2020, the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) / National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) created the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), an open-accessed SARS-CoV-2 information resource. 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of sequence and clinical information for all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 isolates, which are manually curated with value-added annotations and quality evaluated by our in-house automated pipeline. Of particular note, 2019nCoVR performs systematic analyses to obtain a dynamic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations at a global scale. It provides all identified variants and detailed statistics for each virus isolate, and congregates the quality score, functional annotation, and population frequency for each variant. It also generates visualization of the spatiotemporal change for each variant and yields historical viral haplotype network maps for the course of the outbreak from all complete and high-quality genomes. Moreover, 2019nCoVR provides a full collection of literatures on COVID-19, including published papers from PubMed as well as preprints from services such as bioRxiv and medRxiv through Europe PMC. Furthermore, by linking with relevant databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers data submission services for raw sequence reads and assembled genomes, and data sharing with National Center for Biotechnology Information.

8,Real-time Nowcasting and Forecasting of COVID-19 Dynamics in England: the first wave?,"England has been heavily affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with severe 'lock-down' mitigation measures now gradually being lifted. The real-time pandemic monitoring presented here has contributed to the evidence informing this pandemic management. Estimates on the 10th May showed lock-down had reduced transmission by 75%, the reproduction number falling from 2.6 to 0.61. This regionally-varying impact was largest in London of 81% (95% CrI: 77%-84%). Reproduction numbers have since slowly increased, and on 19th June the probability that the epidemic is growing was greater than 50% in two regions, South West and London. An estimated 8% of the population had been infected, with a higher proportion in London (17%). The infection-to-fatality ratio is 1.1% (0.9%-1.4%) overall but 17% (14%-22%) among the over-75s.

9,Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"Introduction Progress in characterising the humoral immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapid but areas of uncertainty persist. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. Methods Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. Results 150 papers were included. Most studies (75%) were observational in design, and included papers were generally of moderate quality based on hospitalised patients. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, and up to around 3 months from disease onset, although inconsistencies remain concerning clinical correlates. Development of neutralising antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is typical, although titres may be low. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross reactivity but limited cross neutralisation occurs with other HCoVs. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo is limited to small, short-term animal studies, which show promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. Interpretation Published literature on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity with regard to methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Antibody dynamics have been evaluated thoroughly in the acute phase but longer follow up and a comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity is needed. The role of protective neutralising antibodies is emerging, with implications for therapeutics and vaccines. Large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.","Post, N.; Eddy, D.; Huntley, C.; van Schalkwyk, M.

10,Global BioID-based SARS-CoV-2 proteins proximal interactome unveils novel ties between viral polypeptides and host factors involved in multiple COVID19-associated mechanisms,"The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses a serious challenge to human societies and economies. SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate complex pathogenic mechanisms that underlie COVID-19 disease. Thus, understanding how viral polypeptides rewire host protein networks enables better-founded therapeutic research. In complement to existing proteomic studies, in this study we define the first proximal interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, at the whole proteome level in human cells. Applying a proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID)-based approach greatly expanded the current knowledge by detecting interactions within poorly soluble compartments, transient, and/or of weak affinity in living cells. Our BioID study was complemented by a stringent filtering and uncovered 2,128 unique cellular targets (1,717 not previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 or 2 proteins) connected to the N- and C-ter BioID-tagged 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by a total of 5,415 (5,236 new) proximal interactions. In order to facilitate data exploitation, an innovative interactive 3D web interface was developed to allow customized analysis and exploration of the landscape of interactions (accessible at http://www.sars-cov-2-interactome.org/). Interestingly, 342 membrane proteins including interferon and interleukin pathways factors, were associated with specific viral proteins. We uncovered ORF7a and ORF7b protein proximal partners that could be related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms. Moreover, comparing proximal interactomes in basal and infection-mimicking conditions (poly(I:C) treatment) allowed us to detect novel links with major antiviral response pathway components, such as ORF9b with MAVS and ISG20; N with PKR and TARB2; NSP2 with RIG-I and STAT1; NSP16 with PARP9-DTX3L. Altogether, our study provides an unprecedented comprehensive resource for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins orchestrate host proteome remodeling and innate immune response evasion, which can inform development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","Laurent, E.

11,Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically-ill COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Background: Recent studies revealed a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, especially in those who are critically ill. Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 22/07/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared to therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised of 24 studies and over 2500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 (95% CI 0.24, 0.39 I2 94%), of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63 I2 91%), of deep-venous-thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32 I2 96%), of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20 I2 90%). In a subgroup of studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared to therapeutic anticoagulation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57 I2 0%). Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening. Higher thromboprophylaxis dosages seem to reduce VTE burden in this patient's cohort compared to standard prophylactic anticoagulation; ongoing randomized controlled trials will further confirm this.","Mohamed, M.

12,The SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is not essential in vitro or in vivo in humans.,"SARS-CoV-2 genome annotation revealed the presence of 10 open reading frames (ORFs), of which the last one (ORF10) is positioned downstream the N gene. It is a hypothetical gene, which was speculated to encode a 38 aa protein. This hypothetical protein does not share sequence similarity with any other known protein and cannot be associated with a function. While the role of this ORF10 was proposed, there is a growing evidence showing that the ORF10 is not a coding region. Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 variants in which the ORF10 gene was prematurely terminated. The disease was not attenuated, and the transmissibility between humans was not hampered. Also in vitro, the strains replicated similarly, as the related viruses with the intact ORF10. Altogether, based on clinical observation and laboratory analyses, it appears that the ORF10 protein is not essential in humans. This observation further proves that the ORF10 should not be treated as the protein-coding gene, and the genome annotations should be amended.","Pancer, K.; Milewska, A.; Owczarek, K.; Dabrowska, A.; Branicki, W.; Sanak, M.; Pyrc, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.257360v1?rss=1,2020-08-29,2020-08-29,,False

We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the search for coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors, to address the current epidemic and future ones that will inevitably arise.","Resnick, S.

14,Silicon Nitride Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, remains viable and therefore potentially infectious on several materials. One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride, a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with silicon nitride would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected. Materials: SARS-CoV-2 virions (2x10^4 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered silicon nitride particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of silicon nitride alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to silicon nitride, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay. Results: Vero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of silicon nitride at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of silicon nitride; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure. Conclusions: Silicon nitride was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of silicon nitride and longer duration of exposure. Surface treatment strategies based on silicon nitride may offer novel methods to discourage SARS-CoV-2 persistence and infectivity on surfaces and discourage the spread of COVID-19.","Lehman, C.

15,Single-cell analysis of human trophoblast stem cell specification reveals activation of fetal cytotrophoblast expression programs including coronavirus associated host factors and human endogenous retroviruses,"The human placenta is increasingly a focus of research related to early child development and the impact of maternal hyperimmune states. The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG-{beta} and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","Tietze, E.; Barbosa, A. R.; Euclydes, V.; Cho, H.

16,Establishment of murine hybridoma cells producing antibodies against spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,"In 2020 the world faced the pandemic of COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing to investigate, diagnose and treat COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denaturized S protein in all tested applications including immunoblotting, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs decreased infection rate of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow to use the corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however due to the restrictions caused by pandemic, it is imperative to have a local source of the antibodies suitable for researches and diagnostics of COVID-19. Moreover, as each mAb has a unique binding sequence, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","Antipova, N.

17,Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans: a systematic review,"Introduction Understanding the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance and control strategies. This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months. Methods For this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. Results 61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear. Interpretation A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.","Shrotri, M.; van Schalkwyk, M. C.

18,"Seroprevalence and correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies: Results from a population-based study in Bonn, Germany","Background Accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence are crucial for the implementation of effective public health measures, but are currently largely lacking in regions with low infection rates. This is further complicated by inadequate test performance of many widely used serological assays. We therefore aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a region with low COVID-19 burden, especially focusing on neutralizing antibodies that presumably constitute a major component of acquired immunity. Methods We invited all individuals who were enrolled in the Rhineland Study, an ongoing community-based prospective cohort study in people aged 30 years and above in the city of Bonn, Germany (N=5427). Between April 24th and June 30th, 2020, 4771 (88%) of these individuals participated in the serosurvey. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured using an ELISA assay, and all positive or borderline results were subsequently examined through both a recombinant immunofluorescent assay and a plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). Findings Seroprevalence was 0.97% (95% CI: 0.72-1.30) by ELISA and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.21-0.61) by PRNT, and did not vary with either age or sex. All PRNT+ individuals reported having experienced at least one symptom (odds ratio (OR) of PRNT+ for each additional symptom: 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.21)). Apart from living in a household with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed or suspected person, a recent history of reduced taste or smell, fever, chills/hot flashes, pain while breathing, pain in arms/legs, as well as muscle pain and weakness were significantly associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in those with mild to moderate infection (ORs 3.44 to 9.97, all p<0.018). Interpretation Our findings indicate a relatively low SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Bonn, Germany (until June 30th, 2020), with neutralizing antibodies detectable in only one third of those with a positive immunoassay result, implying that almost the entire population in this region remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Aziz, N.

19,Where do Brazilian dental students seek information about COVID-19?,"Objective: We investigated where Brazilian dental students seek information about COVID-19 by a self-administered web-based questionnaire. Methods: A social network campaign on Instagram was raised to approach the target population. The dental students responded to a multiple-response question asking where they get information about COVID-19. The possible answers were government official websites or health and education institutions websites, TV Programs, professors, social media, scientific articles, other health professionals, and family members. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of responses were evaluated by gender, age, type of institution, and year of enrollment. Results: A total of 833 valid responses were received. The main source of information used by the dental students were government official websites or health and education institutions websites (88.7%), other health professionals (57.3%), and scientific articles (56.2%). The use of social media was reported by 54.1% of the students, while TV programs were information sources used by 39.9% of the students. The least used information sources were professors (38.1%) and family members (7.8%). Conclusions: The respondents seem to be acquainted to seek information in reliable sources and also use social media as a gateway to keep updated about the pandemics. Therefore, knowing where the dental students seek information about COVID-19 might facilitate dental school directors to approach such public continuously, providing them with trustable information on different platforms.","Brito Aragao, M.

23,Comparative study of a 3CLpro inhibitor and remdesivir against both major SARS-CoV-2 clades in human airway models,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that has claimed over 700,000 human lives. The only SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, for emergency use, is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. PF-00835231 is a pre-clinical lead compound with an alternate target, the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231 and remdesivir in A549+ACE2 cells, using isolates of two major SARS-CoV-2 clades. PF-00835231 is antiviral for both clades, and, in this assay, statistically more potent than remdesivir. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps and validates PF-00835231s time of action.

24,SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage site are generated in vitro during propagation in TMPRSS2-deficient cells,"The spike (S) protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to a host cell receptor which facilitates viral entry. A polybasic motif detected at the cleavage site of the S protein has been shown to broaden the cell tropism and transmissibility of the virus. Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage. Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells. Our study demonstrated that the S protein polybasic cleavage motif is a critical factor underlying SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell tropism. As such, researchers should be alert to the possibility of de novo S gene mutations emerging in tissue-culture propagated virus strains.","Sasaki, M.; Uemura, K.; Sato, A.; Sanaki, T.; Maenaka, K.; Hall, W.

25,Sequence analysis of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates shows a stronger interaction of mutated receptor binding domain with ACE2 receptor,"SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA Coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). It has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As per the protocol laid by ICMR and Health & Family welfare of India, all the suspected cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human.

Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed.

Except three isolates, spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein was identified which depicted a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor compared to the wild type RBD. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates are capable of binding to ACE2 of human, bat, hamster and pangolin.

As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. The study shows that RBDs of all the studied isolates have binding affinity for all the five species, which suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.","Dash, P.; Turuk, J.; Behera, S.

26,Long Period Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Infection of in Vitro Cultured Polarized Human Airway Epithelium,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates throughout human airways. The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 x 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.","Hao, S.; Ning, K.; Kuz, C.

28,Prunella vulgaris extract and suramin block SARS-coronavirus 2 virus Spike protein D614 and G614 variants mediated receptor association and virus entry in cell culture system,"Until now, no approved effective vaccine and antiviral therapeutic are available for treatment or prevention of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SCoV-2) virus infection. In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 g/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2-SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV and suramin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ao, Z.; Chan, M.; Ouyang, M.

We used the hamster infection model to compare the replication ability and pathogenicity of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from early cases originating in Wuhan, China, in February, and infected individuals returning from Europe and elsewhere in March 2020. The HK-13 and HK-95 isolates showed distinct pathogenicity in hamsters, with higher virus titers and more severe pathological changes in the lungs observed compared to other isolates. HK-95 contains a D614G substitution in the spike protein and demonstrated higher viral gene expression and transmission efficiency in hamsters. Intra-host diversity analysis revealed that further quasi species were generated during hamster infections, indicating that strain-specific adaptive mutants with advantages in replication and transmission will continue to arise and dominate subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.","Mok, B.

31,Immune response to vaccine candidates based on different types of nanoscaffolded RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Effective and safe vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are highly desirable to prevent casualties and societal cost caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface-exposed spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a suitable target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs. Here we prepared and analyzed the response to several DNA vaccines based on genetic fusions of RBD to four different scaffolding domains, namely to the foldon peptide, ferritin, lumazine synthase and {beta}-annulus peptide, presenting from 6 to 60 copies of the RBD on each particle. Scaffolding strongly augmented the immune response with production of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response including cytotoxic lymphocytes in mice upon immunization with DNA plasmids. The most potent response was observed for the 24-residue {beta}-annulus peptide scaffold that forms large soluble assemblies, that has the advantage of low immunogenicity in comparison to larger scaffolds.

32,Plasmablast-derived antibody response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans,"Plasmablast responses and derived IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been analysed in three COVID-19 patients. An average of 13.7% and 13.0% of plasmablast-derived IgG MAbs were reactive with virus spike glycoprotein or nucleocapsid, respectively. Of thirty-two antibodies specific for the spike glycoprotein, ten recognised the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thirteen were specific for non-RBD epitopes on the S1 subunit, and nine recognised the S2 subunit. A subset of anti-spike antibodies (10 of 32) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested, five targeted the non-RBD S1, and five targeted the S2 subunit. Of the plasmablast-derived MAbs reacting with nucleocapsid, over half of them (19 of 35) cross-reacted with other betacoronaviruses tested. The cross-reactive plasmablast-derived antibodies harboured extensive somatic mutations, indicative of an expansion of memory B cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified 14 of 32 anti-spike MAbs that neutralised SARS-CoV-2 in independent assays at [&le;] 133 nM (20 g/ml) (five of 10 anti-RBD, three of 13 anti-non-RBD S1 subunit, six of nine anti-S2 subunit). Six of 10 anti-RBD MAbs showed evidence of blockade of ACE2 binding to RBD, and five of six of these were neutralising. Non-competing pairs of neutralising antibodies were identified, which offer potential templates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, K.-Y.

33,Elucidation of remdesivir cytotoxicity pathways through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and transcriptomics,"The adenosine analogue remdesivir has emerged as a frontline antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, with preliminary evidence that it reduces the duration and severity of illness1. Prior clinical studies have identified adverse events1,2, and remdesivir has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial RNA polymerase in biochemical experiments7, yet little is known about the specific genetic pathways involved in cellular remdesivir metabolism and cytotoxicity. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and RNA sequencing, we show that remdesivir treatment leads to a repression of mitochondrial respiratory activity, and we identify five genes whose loss significantly reduces remdesivir cytotoxicity. In particular, we show that loss of the mitochondrial nucleoside transporter SLC29A3 mitigates remdesivir toxicity without a commensurate decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potency and that the mitochondrial adenylate kinase AK2 is a remdesivir kinase required for remdesivir efficacy and toxicity. This work elucidates the cellular mechanisms of remdesivir metabolism and provides a candidate gene target to reduce remdesivir cytotoxicity.","Akinci, E.; Cha, M.; Lin, L.; Yeo, G.; Hamilton, M.

34,A SARS-CoV-2 BioID-based virus-host membrane protein interactome and virus peptide compendium: new proteomics resources for COVID-19 research,"Key steps of viral replication take place at host cell membranes, but the detection of membrane-associated protein-protein interactions using standard affinity-based approaches (e.g. immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, IP-MS) is challenging. To learn more about SARS-CoV-2 - host protein interactions that take place at membranes, we utilized a complementary technique, proximity-dependent biotin labeling (BioID). This approach uncovered a virus-host topology network comprising 3566 proximity interactions amongst 1010 host proteins, highlighting extensive virus protein crosstalk with: (i) host protein folding and modification machinery; (ii) membrane-bound vesicles and organelles, and; (iii) lipid trafficking pathways and ER-organelle membrane contact sites. The design and implementation of sensitive mass spectrometric approaches for the analysis of complex biological samples is also important for both clinical and basic research proteomics focused on the study of COVID-19. To this end, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and infected cell lysates, identifying 189 unique high-confidence virus tryptic peptides derived from 17 different virus proteins, to create a high quality resource for use in targeted proteomics approaches. Together, these datasets comprise a valuable resource for MS-based SARS-CoV-2 research, and identify novel virus-host protein interactions that could be targeted in COVID-19 therapeutics.","St-Germain, J.

35,Secondary analysis of transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection models to characterize COVID-19,"Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathophysiology and outcomes is still limited. To learn more about COVID-19 pathophysiology we performed secondary analyses of transcriptomic data from two in vitro (Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells) and one in vivo (Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found 1467 conserved differentially expressed host genes (differentially expressed in at least two of the three model system transcriptomes compared) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To find potential genetic factors associated with COVID-19, we analyzed these conserved differentially expressed genes using known human genotype-phenotype associations. Genome-wide association study enrichment analysis showed evidence of enrichment for GWA loci associated with platelet functions, blood pressure, body mass index, respiratory functions, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, among others. Since human protein complexes are known to be directly related to viral infection, we combined and analyzed the conserved transcriptomic signature with SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction data and found more than 150 gene clusters. Of these, 29 clusters (with 5 or more genes in each cluster) had at least one gene encoding protein that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These clusters were enriched for different cell types in lung including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell types suggesting their pathophysiological relevancy to COVID-19. Finally, pathway analysis on the conserved differentially expressed genes and gene clusters showed alterations in several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","Ghandikota, S.; Sharma, M.; Jegga, A.

36,A single immunization with spike-functionalized ferritin vaccines elicits neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice,"Development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a public health priority. We designed subunit vaccine candidates using self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles displaying one of two multimerized SARS-CoV-2 spikes: full-length ectodomain (S-Fer) or a C-terminal 70 amino-acid deletion (S{Delta}C-Fer). Ferritin is an attractive nanoparticle platform for production of vaccines and ferritin-based vaccines have been investigated in humans in two separate clinical trials. We confirmed proper folding and antigenicity of spike on the surface of ferritin by cryo-EM and binding to conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a single dose of S{Delta}C-Fer elicited significantly higher neutralizing responses as compared to immunization with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) monomer or spike ectodomain trimer alone. After a second dose, mice immunized with S{Delta}C-Fer exhibited higher neutralizing titers than all other groups. Taken together, these results demonstrate that multivalent presentation of SARS-CoV-2 spike on ferritin can notably enhance elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, thus constituting a viable strategy for single-dose vaccination against COVID-19.","Powell, A.

37,A PCR amplicon-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon for antiviral screening,"The development of specific antiviral compounds to SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent task. One of the obstacles for the antiviral development is the requirement of biocontainment because infectious SARS-CoV-2 must be handled in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Replicon, a non-infectious self-replicative viral RNA, could be a safe and effective tool for antiviral screening; however, SARS-CoV-2 replicon has not been reported yet. Herein, we generated a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Eight fragments covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome except S, E, and M genes were amplified with HiBiT-tag sequence by PCR. The amplicons were ligated and in vitro transcribed to RNA. The cells electroporated with the replicon RNA showed more than 3,000 times higher luminescence than MOCK control cells at 24 hours post-electroporation, indicating robust viral translation and RNA replication. The replication was drastically inhibited by remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. The IC50 of remdesivir in this study was 0.29 M, generally consistent to the IC50 obtained using infectious SARS-CoV-2 in a previous study (0.77 M). Taken together, this system could be applied to the safe and effective antiviral screening without using infectious SARS-CoV-2. Because this is a transient replicon, further improvement including the establishment of stable cell line must be achieved.","Kotaki, T.; Xie, X.; Shi, P.-Y.; Kameoka, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.267567v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.267567v1?rss=1,2020-08-28,2020-08-28,,False

Although various drug repurpose approaches have been used to screen the FDA-approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical phases against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes this disease, no magic bullets have been found until now. We used directed message passing neural network to first build a broad-spectrum anti-beta-coronavirus compound prediction model, which gave satisfactory predictions on newly reported active compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Then we applied transfer learning to fine-tune the model with the recently reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. The fine-tuned model was applied to screen a large compound library with 4.9 million drug-like molecules from ZINC15 database and recommended a list of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds for further experimental testing. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally tested 7 high-scored compounds that also demonstrated good binding strength in docking study against the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 and found one novel compound that inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 37.0 M.

39,SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein is decorated with multiple N- and O-glycans.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly and became a pandemic. Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also in vaccine design and development.","Supekar, N.

42,Designing of Epitope-Based Vaccine from the Conserved Region of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic with a high morbidity rate is posing serious global concern. There is an urgent need to design a suitable therapy or vaccine that could fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries. The T cell epitope that binds with the respective MHC-I with highest affinity was chosen. Molecular dynamic simulation results show that the epitope is well selected. This is an in-silico based study that predicts a novel T cell epitope from the conserved spike glycoprotein that could act as a target for designing of the epitope-based vaccine. Further, B cell epitopes have also been found but the main work focuses on T cell epitope as the immunity generated by it is long lasting as compared to B cell epitope.","Agarwal, V.; Tiwari, A.; Varadwaj, P.

43,"Serum Amyloid P inhibits single stranded RNA-induced lung inflammation, lung damage, and cytokine storm in mice","SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and contains GU-rich sequences distributed abundantly in the genome. In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.","Karhadkar, T.

44,The immunodominant and neutralization linear epitopes for SARS-CoV-2,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes a tremendous threat to global health. Although vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Our present study shed light on the immunodominance, neutralization, and conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 which are potently used for the diagnosis, virus classification and the vaccine design tackling inefficiency, virus mutation and different species of coronaviruses.","Lu, S.; Xie, X.-x.; Zhao, L.; Wang, B.; Zhu, J.; Yang, T.-r.; Yang, G.-w.; Ji, M.; Lv, C.-p.; Xue, J.; Dai, E.-h.; Fu, X.-m.; Liu, D.-q.; Zhang, L.; Hou, S.-j.; Yu, X.-l.; Wang, Y.-l.; Gao, H.-x.; Shi, X.-h.; Ke, C.-w.; Ke, B.-x.; Jiang, C.-g.; Liu, R.-t.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.267716v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.267716v1?rss=1,2020-08-27,2020-08-27,,False
45,SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.6 is the major contributor to transmission in Malaysia,"BackgroundAs of June 30, 2020, Malaysia had confirmed 8,639 cases of COVID-19. About 39% of these were associated with a religious mass gathering event held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 1, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysias main wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to understand the molecular epidemiology.

MethodsWe obtained whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 COVID-19 patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 50 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Malaysian lineage B.6 sequences were further analysed with all available worldwide lineage B.6 sequences.

ResultsNine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the mass gathering and became predominant (63%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) among available global sequences. Increases in reported cases and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly associated with travel and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally-correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. We also report the presence of a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences which has associated with reduced sensitivity in a commercial assay.

ConclusionLineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the region.

Author SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 50 available and 58 newly-generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering and became the most predominant (62.9%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally-acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia were linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95.3% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia or Australia. We also report a mutation in the virus nsP3 gene found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.","Chong, Y.

46,"Structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a rapidly evolving coronavirus protein implicated in immune evasion","The molecular basis for the severity and rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown. ORF8 is a rapidly evolving accessory protein that has been proposed to interfere with immune responses. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 was determined at 2.04 [A] resolution by x-ray crystallography. The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, 73YIDI76. Together the presence of these interfaces shows how SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities.","Flower, T.

Unfortunately, the drug must be administered intravenously, restricting its use to those with relatively advanced disease. RDV is also unstable in plasma and has a complex activation pathway which may contribute to its highly variable antiviral efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A potent orally bioavailable antiviral for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed. We focused on making simple orally bioavailable lipid analogs of Remdesivir nucleoside (RVn, GS-441524) that are processed to RVn-monophosphate, the precursor of the active RVn-triphosphate, by a single step intracellular cleavage. In addition to likely improved oral bioavailability and simpler metabolic activation, two of the three new lipid prodrugs of RVn had anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity 9 to 24 times greater than that of RDV in Vero E6 cells","Schooley, R.

48,Compositional Variability and Mutation Spectra of Monophyletic SARS-CoV-2 Clades,"COVID-19 and its causative pathogen SARS-CoV-2 have rushed the world into a staggering pandemic in a few months and a global fight against both is still going on. Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.","Teng, X.; Li, Q.; Li, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Niu, G.; Zhang, M.; Xiao, J.; Yu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Song, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267781v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267781v1?rss=1,2020-08-27,2020-08-27,,False
49,SARS-CoV-2 genomic and quasispecies analyses in cancer patients reveal relaxed intrahost virus evolution,"Numerous factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.

Author SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.","Siqueira, J.; Goes, L. R.; Alves, B. M.; de Carvalho, P. S.; Cicala, C.; Arthos, J.; Viola, J. P.

51,The Effect of Area Deprivation on COVID-19 Risk in Louisiana,"Purpose: Louisiana currently has the highest per capita case count for COVID-19 in the United States and disproportionately affects the Black or African American population. Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","KC, M.; Oral, E.; Straif-Bourgeois, S.; Rung, A.

52,UK prevalence of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: a point prevalence study using electronic health records,"Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years. Interpretation The population at risk of severe COVID-19 (aged [&ge;]70 years, or with an underlying health condition) comprises 18.5 million individuals in the UK, including a considerable proportion of school-aged and working-aged individuals.","Walker, J.

54,"Sociodemographic disparities in knowledge, practices, and ability to comply with COVID-19 public health measures in Canada","The effectiveness of public health interventions for mitigation of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic depends on individual attitudes and the level of compliance toward these measures. We surveyed a representative sample of the Canadian population about risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards the Canadian COVID-19 public health response. Our analysis demonstrates that these risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours varied by several demographic variables identifying a number of areas in which policies could help address issues of public adherence. Examples include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate but may not have the means to do so, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school reopening policies.

By combining phylogenetic data of 5,198 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with the chronology of non-pharmaceutical interventions in 57 countries, we examine how interventions and combinations thereof alter the divergence rate of viral lineages, which is directly related to the epidemic reproduction number. Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required. Our phylodynamic approach can complement epidemiological models to inform public health strategies against COVID-19.","Rasigade, J.-P.; Barray, A.; Shapiro, J.

Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is [&ge;]45 days after a first positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak/no evidence for reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab [&ge;]45 days after the first positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129).

Only one person was hospitalized at or following time of reinfection swab, but still had relatively mild infection. No deaths were recorded. Risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.04% (95% CI: 0.03-0.05%) and incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 1.09 (95% CI: 0.84-1.42) per 10,000 person-weeks.

58,Stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19: A multinational survey from six Asian regions,"People may experience a heightened level of stress reactions during a pandemic event and in an isolated social environment. A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions.

59,Monitoring COVID-19 related public Interest and population Health Literacy in South Asia: An Internet Search-Interest Based Model,"Background Information epidemiology based on internet search data can be used to model COVID-19 pandemic progressions and monitor population health literacy. However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.","Symum, H.; Ali, K.

60,Pooling of samples to optimize SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR: comparative analysis of two protocols.,"RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 is the main diagnostic test used to identify the novel coronavirus. Several countries have used large scale SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing as one of the important strategies for combating the pandemic. In order to process the massive needs for coronavirus testing, the usual throughput of routine clinical laboratories has reached and often surpassed its limits and new approaches to cope with this challenge must be developed. This study has aimed to evaluate the use pool of samples as a strategy to optimize the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in a general population. A total of 220 naso/orofaryngeal swab samples were collected and tested using two different protocols of sample pooling. In the first protocol (Protocol A); 10 clinical samples were pooled before RNA extraction. The second protocol (Protocol B) consisted of pooling the already extracted RNAs from 10 individual samples. Results from Protocol A were identical (100% agreement) with the individual results. However, for results from Protocol B, reduced agreement (91%) was observed in relation to results obtained by individual testing. Inconsistencies observed were related to RT-qPCR results with higher Cycle Thresholds (Ct > 32.73). Furthermore, in pools containing more than one positive individual, the Ct of the pool was equivalent to the lowest Ct among the individual results. These results provide additional evidence in favor of the clinical use of pooled samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR and suggest that pooling of samples before RNA extraction is preferrable in terms of diagnostic yield.","Volpato, F.; Lima-Morales, D.; Wink, P.

61,Serum lipid profile changes and their clinical diagnostic significance in COVID-19 Mexican Patients,"Background: COVID-19 has been recognized as an emerging and rapidly evolving health condition. For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections. Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility. Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.","Osuna-Ramos, J.

This population experiences a higher proportion of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses than the general population and has been shown to have a high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Methods We examined the number of hospital discharges to all Welsh adult care homes and the subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring over an 18 week period 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on the incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics (including size, type of provision and health board). Results A total of 1068 care homes were monitored; 330 homes experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and 511 homes received a discharge from hospital over the study period. The exposure to discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.49, p = 0.28), after adjusting for care home size, which was by far the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison to homes of <10 residents were: 3.4 (2.0, 5.8) for 10-24 residents; 8.3 (5.0, 13.8) for 25-49 residents; and 17.3 (9.6, 31.1) for homes of 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were very similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison to periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.

63,Mortality from COVID in Colombia and Peru: Analyses of Mortality Data and Statistical Forecasts,"National predictions of the course of COVID mortality can be used to plan for effective healthcare responses as well as to support COVID policymaking. We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48%-92% over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7%-55% over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13% excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34% excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.","Brown, P.

During COVID-19 pandemic, usual diagnostic practices such as bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate are limited due to their associated high risk of exposure for the operator. In order to set primary focus on the protection of health care personnel, a modified tracheal aspiration (M-TA) technique is developed and used for acquiring a lower respiratory tract of microbiological samples with a closed suction device. Method: Retrospective observational study to evaluate effectiveness of M-TA is conducted. Results: A total of 33 M-TA samples were analyzed. In 66,6% of the cases, results led to a change in medical decision making. A 100% accuracy was achieved regarding COVID-19 diagnosis and a 56% bacterial growth-rate in cultives where VAP was suspected. No health care personnel have developed symptoms nor tested positive for COVID-19 during or after sample collection. Conclusion: M-TA technique presented could be considered as a safe and effective procedure with low percentage of complications.","Schverdfinger, S.; Carboni Bisso, I.; Famiglietti, R.; Di Grazia, M.; Di Stefano, S.; Las Heras, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180802v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180802v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True
65,In-house assembled protective devices in laboratory safety against SARS-nCoV-2 in clinical biochemistry laboratory of a COVID dedicated hospital,"Background: Health Care Workers (HCWs) of diagnostic laboratory handling COVID positive samples are at risk and need to take protective measures. Many protective materials were not available when the pandemic reached India forcing laboratory managers to take innovative measures to protect the laboratory staffs. Methods: We made face shields from OHP sheets and substitute of biosafety cabinets from cardboard boxes fitted with hypochlorite spraying devices. Here we present if these two in-house developed safety devices when incorporated in standard operating procedure (SOP) of laboratory safety were effective in clinical biochemistry laboratory of dedicated COVID hospitals. Results: We assessed contamination of laboratory surfaces (n=6) and rate of SARS-nCov-2 positivity from their nasal and throat swab by RT-PCR among laboratory personnel (n=18) after 14 days of their use along with other routine safety devices like use of gloves, surgical masks, OT gowns etc. These HCWs were checked regularly for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and none had any signs and symptoms during these 14days. The SARS-nCov-2 test report was negative for the staff members and no surface contamination was detected. We conclude that innovative and cost effective protective devices can be built in-house with locally available resources and are effective in preventing the spread of COVID 19 among the staff working in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Conclusions: Laboratory managers in resource scarce areas need to be innovative to face such sudden safety challenges like COVID-19 pandemic.","Dubey, A.; Bansal, A.; Sonkar, S.

66,Parameter Estimation of COVID-19 Pandemic Model with Self Protection Behavior Changes,"A mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is proposed by incorporating self-protection behavior changes in the population. The disease-free equilibrium point is computed and its stability analysis is studied. The basic reproduction number(R 0 ) of the model is computed and the disease-free equilibrium point is locally and globally stable for R 0<1 and unstable for R 0 >1. Based on the available data the unknown model parameters are estimated using a combination of least square and Bayesian estimation methods for different countries. Using forward sensitivity index the model parameters are carried out to determine and identify the key factors for the spread of disease dynamics. From country to country the sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus varies. It is found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment. It is also demonstrated that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Numerical simulations also show that the virus transmission dynamics depend mostly on those sensitive parameters.","Mekonen, K. G.; Habtemicheal, T. G.; Balcha, S.

Result: Minor discrepancies were observed in the clinical presentations, radiologic involvement and laboratory results across groups of patients under treatment with specific drugs. Aspirin-users had better clinical outcome with lower need of ventilation support, whereas, metformin-users had increased chance of intubation and of mortality.

68,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients without clinical signs of cardiac involvement,"Background - Cardiovascular complication in patients affected by novel Coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) are increasingly recognized. However, although a cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for inflammatory cells in autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients has been reported, the presence of the virus in cardiomyocytes has not been documented yet. Methods - We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA. Conclusions - In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.","Bulfamante, G.

69,A unique view of SARS-CoV-2 through the lens of ORF8 protein,"Immune evasion is one of the unique characteristics of COVID-19 attributed to the ORF8 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This protein is involved in modulating the host adaptive immunity through downregulating MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules and innate immune responses by surpassing the interferon mediated antiviral response of the host. To understand the immune perspective of the host with respect to the ORF8 protein, a comprehensive study of the ORF8 protein as well as mutations possessed by it, is performed. Chemical and structural properties of ORF8 proteins from different hosts, that is human, bat and pangolin, suggests that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13-CoV are very much closer related than that of Pangolin-CoV. Eighty-seven mutations across unique variants of ORF8 (SARS-CoV-2) are grouped into four classes based on their predicted effects. Based on geolocations and timescale of collection, a possible flow of mutations was built. Furthermore, conclusive flows of amalgamation of mutations were endorsed upon sequence similarity and amino acid conservation phylogenies. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the uniqueness of rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 through the ORF8.","Hassan, S. S.; Ghosh, S.; Attrish, D.; Choudhury, P.

70,Multi-species ELISA for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in animals,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with millions of infected humans and hundreds of thousands of fatalities. As the novel disease - referred to as COVID-19 - unfolded, occasional anthropozoonotic infections of animals by owners or caretakers were reported in dogs, felid species and farmed mink. Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions. The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31% was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated. Hence, a versatile and reliable ELISA protocol was established that enables high-throughput antibody detection in a broad range of animal species, which may be used for outbreak investigations, to assess the seroprevalence in susceptible species or to screen for reservoir or intermediate hosts.","Wernike, K.; Aebischer, A.; Michelitsch, A.; Hoffmann, D.; Freuling, C.; Balkema-Buschmann, A.; Graaf, A.; Mueller, T.; Osterrieder, N.; Rissmann, M.; Rubbenstroth, D.; Schoen, J.; Schulz, C.; Trimpert, J.; Ulrich, L.; Volz, A.; Mettenleiter, T.; Beer, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.266825v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.266825v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,False
71,Inhibiting coronavirus replication in cultured cells by chemical ER stress,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens for which no specific treatment is available. Here, we provide evidence that pharmacological reprogramming of ER stress pathways can be exploited to suppress CoV replication. We found that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin efficiently inhibits coronavirus (HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) replication in different cell types, (partially) restores the virus-induced translational shut-down, and counteracts the CoV-mediated downregulation of IRE1 and the ER chaperone BiP. Proteome-wide data sets revealed specific pathways, protein networks and components that likely mediate the thapsigargin-induced antiviral state, including HERPUD1, an essential factor of ER quality control, and ER-associated protein degradation complexes. The data show that thapsigargin hits a central mechanism required for CoV replication, suggesting that thapsigargin (or derivatives thereof) may be developed into broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs.

72,AI aided design of epitope-based vaccine for the induction of cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2,"The heavy burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our society triggered the race towards the development of therapies or preventive strategies. Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes. Next, the results of our approach were compared with other vaccine-design strategies reported in the literature. The risk of immuno-toxicity was also assessed. The analysis of epitope conservation among other Coronaviridae was carried out in order to facilitate the selection of peptides shared across different SARS-CoV-2 strains and which might be conserved in emerging zootic coronavirus strains. Finally, the potential applicability of the selected epitopes for the development of a vaccine eliciting cellular immunity for COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of such an approach.","Mazzocco, G.; Niemiec, I.; Myronov, A.; Skoczylas, P.; Kaczmarczyk, J.; Sanecka-Duin, A.; Gruba, K.; Krol, P.; Drwal, M.; Szczepanik, M.; Pyrc, K.; Stepniak, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267997v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.267997v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,False

We describe features of these epitopes relevant for vaccine design, while indicating knowledge gaps that can, in part, be augmented using prior immunological data from SARS-CoV. The landscape of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes that we describe can help guide SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development as well as future immunological studies.

74,Furin Cleavage Site Is Key to SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,"SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world. Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.

ImportanceAs COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.

75,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G increases entry fitness across a range of ACE2 levels, directly outcompetes the wild type, and is preferentially incorporated into trimers","Early in the current pandemic, the D614G mutation arose in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and quickly became the dominant variant globally. Mounting evidence suggests D614G enhances viral entry. Here we use a direct competition assay with single-cycle viruses to show that D614G outcompetes the wildtype. We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers. Our findings suggest that D614G increases infection of cells expressing a wide range of ACE2, and informs the mechanism underlying enhanced entry. The tools developed here can be broadly applied to study other Spike variants and SARS-CoV-2 entry, to inform functional studies of viral evolution and vaccine development.","Michaud, W.

Nearly 0.4 million mutations were identified so far in [~]60,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. In this study, we compared 207 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh and their comparison with 467 globally reported sequences to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of mutations, availability of unique mutations, and their apparent impact on pathogenicity of the virus in victims of Bangladeshi population. Phylogenetic analyses indicates that in Bangladesh, SARS-CoV-2 viruses might arrived through infected travelers from European countries, and the GR clade was found as predominant in this region. We found 2602 mutations including 1602 missense mutations, 612 synonymous mutations, 36 insertions and deletions with 352 other mutations types.

77,Highly potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin therapeutic candidates,"Globally accessible preventive and therapeutic molecules against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. DARPin molecules are an emerging class of novel therapeutics based on naturally occurring repeat proteins ([~]15 kDa in size) and can be rapidly produced in bacteria in large quantities. Here, we report the identification of 380 DARPin molecules specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein selected from a naive library of 1012 DARPin molecules. Using extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization, (pseudo)virus neutralization assays and cryo-EM analysis, 11 mono-DARPin molecules targeting either the receptor binding domain (RBD), the S1 N-terminal-domain (NTD) or the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were chosen. Based on these 11 mono-DARPin molecules, 31 anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin molecules were constructed which can broadly be grouped into 2 types; multi-paratopic RBD-neutralizing DARPin molecules and multi-mode DARPin molecules targeting simultaneously RBD, NTD and the S2 domain. Each of these multi-DARPin molecules acts by binding with 3 DARPin modules to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, leading to potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection down to 1 ng/ml (12 pM) and potentially providing protection against viral escape mutations. Additionally, 2 DARPin modules binding serum albumin, conferring an expected half-life of about 3 weeks in humans, were included in the multi-DARPin molecules. The protective efficacy of one multi-DARPin molecule was studied in a Golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model, resulting in a significant reduction in viral load and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the multi-DARPin molecules reported here display very high antiviral potency, high-production yield, and a long systemic half-life, and thereby have the potential for single-dose use for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Walser, M.; Rothenberger, S.; Hurdiss, D.

78,Perceptions of Risk of Attending Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a UK public opinion survey,"In order to inform clinical and research practice in secondary care in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online survey was used to collect public opinions on attending hospitals. The survey link was circulated via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Involvement (PPI) Leads network and social media. 402 people completed the survey. Participants age ranged from the 18-85+, with the majority (337 (84%)) aged between 35 to 74 years. There were a higher number of women (77%) compared to men (23%); and were mainly White European (91%) compared to BAME (6%), or other (2%). Data collection included self-identified risk status due to comorbidity or age, and 100 point Likert-type scales to measures feelings of safety, factors affecting feelings of safety, intention to participate in research, comfort with new ways of working and attitudes to research. Results for feelings of safety scales indicate two distinct groups; one of respondents who felt quite safe and one of those who did not. Implementation of COVID-19 related safety measures such as social distancing, use of PPE and cleaning were strongly supported by most respondents. There was ambivalence around less certain measures such as regular staff antigen and antibody testing. Respondents were most likely to participate in research related to their own condition, COVID-19 research and vaccine research, but less likely to participate in healthy volunteer research, especially if suffering from a pre-existing comorbidity identified with increased risk or were female. There was general agreement that participants are comfortable with new ways of working, such as remote consultation, though women and BAME respondents were less comfortable. Findings raise concerns for health inequalities already impacting some groups in the pandemic. The role of clinical necessity and personal benefit support the reopening of services in line with clinical necessity. Moderate caution in respect of vaccine research relative to patient-participant research presents a challenge for pending recruitment demands, and would benefit from qualitative research to explore themes and concerns in more depth and support development and targeting of key messaging.","Pritchard, R.; Brady, E.; Chudasama, Y.; Davies, M.; McCann, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180836v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180836v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True
79,Clinical Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 on Therapeutic Anticoagulants,"Background: COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and an increased incidence of thrombosis. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who either continued therapeutic anticoagulants previously prescribed or who were newly started on anticoagulants during hospitalization. Methods: We performed an observational study of adult inpatients with COVID-19 at 10 hospitals affiliated with Northwestern Medicine in the Chicagoland area from March 9 to June 26, 2020. We evaluated clinical outcomes of subjects with COVID-19 who were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization and those who were newly started on these medications compared to those who were on prophylactic doses of these medications based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. The primary outcome was overall death while secondary outcomes were critical illness (WHO score >5), need for mechanical ventilation, and death among those subjects who first had critical illness adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score, glucose on admission, and use of antiplatelet agents. Results: 1,716 subjects with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. 171 subjects (10.0%) were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation and 201(11.7%) were started on new therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization. In subjects continued on home therapeutic anticoagulation, there were no differences in overall death, critical illness, mechanical ventilation, or death among subjects with critical illness compared to subjects on prophylactic anticoagulation. Subjects receiving new therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 were more likely to die (OR 5.93; 95% CI 3.71-9.47), have critical illness (OR 14.51; 95% CI 7.43-28.31), need mechanical ventilation (OR 11.22; 95% CI 6.67-18.86), and die after first having critical illness. (OR 5.51; 95% CI 2.80 -10.87). Conclusions: Continuation of outpatient prescribed anticoagulant was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. Therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 in absence of other indications was associated with worse clinical outcomes.","Patel, N. G.; Bhasin, A.; Feinglass, J. M.; Belknap, S. M.; Angarone, M.

80,Preventing disease after exposure to COVID-19 using hydroxychloroquine: A summary of a protocol for exploratory re-analysis of age and time-nuanced effects.,"BACKGROUND: A recently published randomized trial (Boulware et al., 2020, NCT04308668) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis found a reduction in Covid-19 of 17%. In the context of ambitious powering to detect a 50% reduction, this non-statistically significant finding could translate to a reduction of 22,000/130,828 cases (CDC 8/12/20) among US health care workers (HCW), impacting trajectory and resource utilization models that drive decisions on lockdowns and social distancing. Data found only in the appendix of Boulware et al. suggested greater differences in the effect of HCQ among sub-groups. There were reductions (36%) in younger (<35 years) and increases (110%) in older (>50 years) subjects. Our preliminary analysis revealed a significant negative correlation (slope -0.211, CI -0.328-0.094, p=0.016) between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when initiated within one day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). There were also differences in disease reduction by HCQ by type of exposure (HCW - 8% vs. household contacts - 31%; RR 0.691, CI 0.398-1.2). The definitions of exposure severity did not discriminate between the numbers or duration (> 10 minutes) of exposures. Differences between exposure types may result from younger HCW and higher risks in less trained household contacts with little access to advanced PPE. The ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid were likely confounders, as was the possibly active folate placebo. Exploratory reanalysis of the raw dataset may inform an age- and stage- nuanced approach to COVID-19 using HCQ testable by prospective studies and may provide insight into the various proposed mechanisms of HCQ. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an exploratory re-analysis of the de-identified raw dataset from a randomized study of the use of HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 with view to further defining: a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, b) The age dependent effect of HCQ; c) The sub-stratification of time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. d) The design of future clinical trials to test the hypotheses generated by this study. METHODS: Should granularity of data (by age, time-lag, level and type of exposure) be greater than that originally reported, Fisher Exact test will be used to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in HCQ- and control groups, for each sub-group stratification. Since the degree of loss of data granularity due to de-identification is yet unknown, exploratory analyses involving other demographic characteristics cannot be planned. Where sufficient data granularity exists, univariate regression analyses will be conducted to examine the effect of age- and time lag on any effect of HCQ. The possibility will be explored of conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching to examine observational data relating to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. This analysis will be expanded should a dataset from a similarly designed study (Mitja et al., 2020, NCT04304053), with directionally similar results, become available.

81,Chest X-ray image analysis and classification for COVID-19 pneumonia detection using Deep CNN,"In order to speed up the discovery of COVID-19 disease mechanisms, this research developed a new diagnosis platform using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to assist radiologists with diagnosis by distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from non-COVID-19 pneumonia in patients at Middlemore Hospital based on chest X-rays classification and analysis. Such a tool can save time in interpreting chest X-rays and increase the accuracy and thereby enhance our medical capacity for detection and diagnosis COVID-19. The idea is that a set of X-ray medical lung images (which include normal, infected by bacteria, infected by virus including COVID-19) were used to train a deep CNN which can be able to distinguish between the noise and the useful information and then uses this training to interpret new images by recognizing patterns that indicate certain diseases such as coronavirus infection in the individual images. The supervised learning method is used as the process of learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a doctor supervising the learning process. It becomes more accurate as the number of analyzed images growing. In this way, it imitates the training for a doctor, but the theory is that since it is capable of learning from a far larger set of images than any human, can have the potential of being more accurate.","Gao, T.; Wang, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.20178913v1?rss=1,2020-08-26,2020-08-26,,True

84,Convalescent Plasma in treatment of COVID-19: A review of evidence for a living systematic benefit-risk assessment,"Objectives: We aimed to review the evidence for a living systematic benefit risk assessment for convalescent plasma use amongst patients with severe COVID-19 disease, based on currently available data. Methods: The assessment used the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. Convalescent plasma treatment in severe COVID-19 was compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted to identify published papers from January 1st, 2019 until July 8th, 2020. A value tree was constructed which included ranked key benefits and risks. Results: We screened 396 papers from PubMed and 127 papers from Embase. Four studies were eligible for inclusion as they contained comparative data. Results from a randomised controlled trial revealed a non-statistically significant shortening of time to clinical improvement of 2.15 days (95% CI, -5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a possible signal of increased efficacy amongst a small subset of patients with severe disease (but not life threatening disease), however this study may have been underpowered. Interpretation of findings amongst the three controlled non-randomised studies were limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomisation, and confounding by co-administration of other treatments. Limited data availability at the current time precluded construction of a data summary table and further quantitative analysis. Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from controlled studies to complete a data summary table for a systematic benefit-risk assessment of the use of CP for severe COVID-19 disease at the current time, and as such a benefit-risk conclusion could not be made. Whilst uncontrolled case series have suggested positive findings with CP, results from these studies are very difficult to interpret. We provide a framework which can be updated when further data that have an impact on the benefit-risk become available.","Davies, M.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Denyer, J.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Osborne, V.; Shakir, S.

85,Molecular dynamics reveals complex compensatory effects of ionic strength on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/hACE-2 interaction,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already killed more than 800,000 people worldwide. To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of spike RBD/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.

87,Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston area highlights the role of recurrent importation and superspreading events,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with 111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.","Lemieux, J.; Siddle, K.

88,COVID-19 is associated with relative ADAMTS13 deficiency and VWF multimer formation resembling TTP,"Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, A. A.

89,Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of outpatients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19: A multi-center observational study,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has not been associated with improved survival among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the majority of observational studies and similarly was not identified as an effective prophylaxis following exposure in a prospective randomized trial. We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting. Methods: We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching. Results: Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations. QTc prolongation events occurred in 2% of patients prescribed hydroxychloroquine with no reported arrhythmia events among those with data available. Conclusions: In this retrospective observational study of SARS-CoV-2 infected non-hospitalized patients hydroxychloroquine exposure was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization. Additional exploration of hydroxychloroquine in this mildly symptomatic outpatient population is warranted.","Ip, A.; Ahn, J.; Zhou, Y.; Goy, A. H.; Hansen, E.; Pecora, A. L.; Sinclaire, B.

In literature there are not available paediatric studies about the identification of SARS-CoV-2 through nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), but the use of NPA is deemed to be better than NS to identify respiratory viruses in children.

We collected 300 paired samples (NS and NPA) from children hospitalized and followed up in our paediatric unit. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of NS referred to NPA of the whole sample and then, considering both the age ([&ge;] and < 6 years old) and the period of collection (March vs follow up) as covariates in different analysis. The NS has a low sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in children when referred to NPA; whereas its specificity results high. In children under 6 years of age, our results suggest to prefer the collection of NS, whenever possible. Though statistically not significant, the sensitivity of NS becomes higher if it is performed before NPA.","Di Pietro, G.

92,Temporal increase in D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East and North Africa: Phylogenetic and mutation analysis study,"Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among molecular sequences. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is the subject of an immune selective pressure which increases the variability in such region. This study aimed to identify mutations in the S gene among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focusing on the D614G mutation, that has a presumed fitness advantage. Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software. Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%) in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year based on large clusters' Bayesian analyses. The D614G mutation appeared to be taking over the COVID-19 infections in the MENA. Bayesian analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have been circulating in MENA earlier than previously reported.","Sallam, M.; Ababneh, N.; Dababseh, D.; Bakri, F.; Mahafzah, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20176792v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20176792v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
93,"Therapeutic Prospects for Th-17 Cell Immune Storm Syndrome and Neurological Symptoms in COVID-19: Thiamine Efficacy and Safety, In-vitro Evidence and Pharmacokinetic Profile","Introduction Emerging infectious diseases, especially the coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), can be complicated by a severe exacerbation in the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 proinflammatory immune storm. This enhanced immune response plays a major role in mortality and morbidity, including neurological symptoms. We hypothesized that countering the cytokine storm with thiamine may have therapeutic efficacy in lowering the Th17 cell proinflammatory response. We used an in vitro study and corroborated those results in disease controls (DC). We developed an effective dose range and model for key pharmacokinetic measures with the potential of targeting the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Study Participants and Methods We investigated the effect of a three-week 200 mg dose of thiamine in lowering the Th17 response in sixteen DC (proinflammatory origin due to heavy alcohol drinking) patients; and eight healthy control/volunteers (HV) as a pilot clinical-translational investigation. To further investigate, we performed an in vitro study evaluating the effectiveness of thiamine treatment in lowering the Th17 proinflammatory response in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) treated with ethanol. In this in vitro study, 100 mg/day equivalent (0.01 ug/ml) thiamine was used. Based on recent publications, we compared the results of the IL-17 response from our clinical and in vitro study to those found in other proinflammatory disease conditions (metabolic conditions, septic shock, viral infections and COVID-19), including symptoms, and dose ranges of effective and safe administration of thiamine. We developed a dose range and pharmacokinetic profile for thiamine as a novel intervention strategy in COVID-19 to alleviate the effects of the cytokine storm and neurological symptoms. Results The DC group showed significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines compared to HV. Three-week of 200 mg daily thiamine treatment significantly lowered the baseline IL-17 levels while increased IL-22 levels (anti-inflammatory response). This was validated by an in vitro macrophage response using a lower thiamine dose equivalent (100 mg), which resulted in attenuation of IL-17 and elevation of IL-22 at the mRNA level compared to the ethanol-only treated group. In humans, a range of 79-474 mg daily of thiamine was estimated to be effective and safe as an intervention for the COVID-19 cytokine storm. A literature review showed that several neurological symptoms of COVID-19 (which exist in 45.5% of the severe cases) occur in other viral infections and neuroinflammatory states that may also respond to thiamine treatment. Discussion The Th17 mediated IL-17 proinflammatory response can potentially be attenuated by thiamine. Thiamine, a very safe drug even at very high doses, could be repurposed for treating the cytokine/immune storm of COVID-19 and the subsequent neurological symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients. Further studies using thiamine as an interventional/prevention strategy in severe COVID-19 patients could identify its precise anti-inflammatory role.","Vatsalya, V.; Li, F.; Frimodig, J.

94,A deterministic linear infection model to inform Risk-Cost-Benefit Analysis of activities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"Risk-cost-benefit analysis requires the enumeration of decision alternatives, their associated outcomes, and the quantification of uncertainty. Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a deterministic linear model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. The linearity assumption makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, J.

95,An examination of COVID-19 mitigation efficiency among 23 countries,"The purpose of this paper is to compare the relative mitigation efficiency of COVID-19 transmission among 23 selected countries, including 19 countries in the G20, two heavily infected countries (Iran and Spain), and two highly populous countries (Pakistan and Nigeria). This paper evaluated the mitigation efficiency for each country at each stage by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) tools and analyzed changes in mitigation efficiency across stages. Pearson correlation tests were conducted between each change to examine the impact of efficiency ranks in the previous stage on subsequent stages. An indicator was developed to judge epidemic stability and was applied to practical cases involving lifting travel restrictions and restarting the economy in some countries. The results showed that Korea and Australia performed with the highest efficiency in preventing the diffusion of COVID-19 for the whole period covering 120 days since the first confirmed case, while the USA ranked at the bottom. China, Japan, Korea and Australia were judged to have recovered from the attack of COVID-19 due to higher epidemic stability.","Chen, Y.-T.; Yu, S.-H.; Su, E.

96,FLOW CYTOMETRY MULTIPLEXED METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF NEUTRALIZING HUMAN ANTIBODIES TO THE NATIVE SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN,"A correct identification of seropositive individuals for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is of paramount relevance to assess the degree of protection of a human population to present and future outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe here a sensitive and quantitative flow cytometry method using the cytometer-friendly non-adherent Jurkat T cell line that stably expresses the full-length native spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a truncated form of the human EGFR that serves a normalizing role. S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self-cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti-S immunoglobulins by calculating a ratio of the mean fluorescence intensities obtained by double- staining with the sera and a monoclonal antibody specific for EGFR. We show that the method allows to detect immune individuals regardless of the result of other serological tests or even repeated PCR monitoring. It can also be employed to detect neutralizing activity in the sera of individuals. Finally, the method can be used in a multiplexed format to simultaneously measure all anti-S human immunoglobulin isotypes in blood and mucosal fluids including total saliva.","Horndler, L.; Delgado, P.; Balabanov, I.; Cornish, G.; Llamas, M.

97,Evaluation of the current therapeutic approaches for COVID-19: a meta-analysis,"Background and rationale: Limited data on the efficacy and safety of currently applied COVID-19 therapeutics and their impact on COVID-19 outcomes have raised additional concern. Aim and Methods: We estimated the impact of the current treatments on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 by a meta-analysis. The comprehensive search included studies reporting clinical features and treatment strategies published from January 21, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Results: We included 52 studies that involved 13,966 COVID-19 patients. We found that the most prevalent treatments were antivirals (proportion: 0.74, 95% CI : [0.65, 0.83]) and antibiotics (proportion: 0.73, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.83]). The COVID-19 severity increased among patients taking glucocorticoids (risk ratio (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.76]) or immunoglobulins (RR = 3.83, 95% CI: [1.27, 11.53]), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) and glucocorticoids increased the length of ICU stay (RRT : RR= 11.89, 95% CI: [3.26, 43.39]; glucocorticoids: RR = 3.10, 95% CI: [1.52, 6.29]). The COVID-19 severity and mortality increased among patients taking tocilizumab (severity: F = 25.53, P = 0.02; mortality: F = 19.37, P = 0.02). The most effective treatment was the combination of arbidol with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with placebo (mean difference = 0.5, 95% CI [-0.60, 1.66]), and the safest combination was remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir (RR= 0.78, 95% CI [0.32, 1.91]). Conclusion: glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, RRT, and tocilizumab might worsen COVID-19 outcomes, and the most effective and safest treatment strategy for COVID-19 is the combination of different antivirals.","Abdelrahman, Z.; Liu, Q.; Jiang, S.; Li, M.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, X.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180638v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.20180638v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
98,Role of interfering substances in the survival of coronaviruses on surfaces and their impact on the efficiency of hand and surface disinfection,"Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for hospital-acquired viral infections. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of interfering substances on SARS-CoV-2 surface stability and virucidal efficiency of hand sanitizers and surface disinfectant. To this end, surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 was measured on stainless steel in different experimental conditions, with or without an artificial mucus/saliva mixture and compared against that of human coronavirus HCoV-229E and feline coronavirus FCoV. The impact of the mucus/saliva mixture on the virucidal efficiency of 3 commercial alcohol hand sanitizers and 1 surface chemical disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E and FCoV was then measured. Our results indicate that mucus/saliva mixture did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on the surface survival of tested viruses, with temperature being an important parameter. In addition, we demonstrated that interfering substances may play an important role in the virucidal efficacy of hand sanitizers and disinfectants, highlighting the need for adapted testing protocols that better reflect current - real life -conditions of use.","Szpiro, L.; Pizzorno, A.; Durimel, L.; Julien, T.; Traversier, A.; Bouchami, D.; Marie, Y.; Rosa-Calatrava, M.; Terrier, O.; Moules, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.20180042v1?rss=1,2020-08-25,2020-08-25,,True
99,The influence of major S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on the potential B cell epitopes,"SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly transmitted worldwide and results in the COVID-19 pandemic. Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants. 12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after vaccination.

Author SummaryThe global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.","Yuan, X.; Li, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264895v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264895v1?rss=1,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,,False
