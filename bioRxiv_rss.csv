0,CovidNudge: diagnostic accuracy of a novel lab-free point-of-care diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2,"Background Access to rapid diagnosis is key to the control and management of SARS-CoV-2. Reverse Transcriptase- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing usually requires a centralised laboratory and significant infrastructure. We describe the development and diagnostic accuracy assessment of a novel, rapid point-of-care RT-PCR test, the DnaNudge platform CovidNudge test, which requires no laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs are inserted directly into a cartridge which contains all reagents and components required for RT-PCR reactions, including multiple technical replicates of seven SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (rdrp1, rdrp2, e-gene, n-gene, n1, n2 and n3) and human ribonuclease P (RNaseP) as a positive control. Between April and May 2020, swab samples were tested in parallel using the CovidNudge direct-to-cartridge platform and standard laboratory RT-PCR using swabs in viral transport medium. Samples were collected from three groups: self-referred healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19 (Group 1, n=280/386; 73%); patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 (Group 2, n=15/386; 4%) and hospital inpatient admissions with or without suspected COVID-19 (Group 3, n=91/386; 23%). Results Of 386 paired samples tested across all groups, 67 tested positive on the CovidNudge platform and 71 with standard laboratory RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the test varied by group (Group 1 93% [84-98%], Group 2 100% [48-100%] and Group 3 100% [29-100%], giving an average sensitivity of 94.4% (95% confidence interval 86-98%) and an overall specificity of 100% (95%CI 99-100%; Group 1 100% [98-100%]; Group 2 100% [69-100%] and Group 3 100% [96-100%]). Point of care testing performance was comparable during a period of high (25%) and low (3%) background prevalence. Amplification of the viral nucleocapsid (n1, n2, n3) targets were most sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV2, with the assay able to detect 1x104 viral particles in a single swab. Conclusions The CovidNudge platform offers a sensitive, specific and rapid point of care test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory handling or sample pre-processing. The implementation of such a device could be used to enable rapid decisions for clinical care and testing programs.","Gibani, M.

1,Genomic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 During Early Introduction into the United States National Capital Region,"Background: The early COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread. In the United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and case severity or transmissibility. Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System, building on methods developed by the ARTIC network. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early establishment of the virus within the region. Results: We analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March 11-31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belonged to all five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had genomes belonging to all of these clades. Conclusions: We established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as March 2020. Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, P.

2,Comparison of COVID-19 Infections Among Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers,"Objectives Healthcare workers face distinct occupational challenges that affect their personal health, especially during a pandemic. In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). Methods We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results From March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years, 53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 vs 1211/2649, P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 vs 946/2649, P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12/193 vs 426/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 vs 564/2649, P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38/193 vs 1189/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 vs 532/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154/193: 80% vs 1275/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 20% vs 1264/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for IMV (6/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 1% vs 219/2694 8%, P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW. Conclusions Compared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and were less likely to be admitted.","Kim, R.; Nachman, S.; Fernandes, R.; Meyers, K.; Taylor, M.; LeBlanc, D.; Singer, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174482v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174482v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
3,Has COVID-19 Hurt Resident Education? A network-wide resident survey on education and experience during the pandemic,"Purpose: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the healthcare system has been forced to adapt in myriad ways. Residents have faced significant changes in work schedules, deployment to COVID-19 units, and alterations to didactics. This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident perception of their own education within the Nuvance Health Network. Methods: We conducted an observational study assessing resident perception of changes in education and lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was developed to assess the quality and quantity of resident education during this time and administered anonymously to all residents within the healthcare network. Results: Eighty-four (68%) residents responded to the survey from five different specialties, including general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and radiology. The average change in hours per week performing clinical work was -5.6 hours (SD=16.8), in time studying was +0.02 hours (SD=4.6), in weekly didactics was -1.7 hours (SD=3.1), and in attending involvement was -1.2 hours (SD=2.3). Additionally, 32% of residents expressed concern that the pandemic has diminished their preparedness to become an attending, 13% expressed concern about completing graduation requirements, and 3% felt they would need an additional year of training. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, residents perceived that time spent on organized didactics/conferences decreased and that attending physicians are less involved in education. Furthermore, the majority of residents felt that the quality of didactic education diminished as a result of the pandemic. Surprisingly, while many residents expressed concerns about being prepared to become an attending, few were concerned about completing graduation requirements or needing an extra year of education. In light of these findings, it is critical to devote attention to the effects of the pandemic on residents' professional trajectories and create innovative opportunities for improving education during this challenging time.","Ostapenko, A.; McPeck, S.; Liechty, S.; Kleiner, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20171256v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20171256v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True

5,Quantifying absolute neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 by a standardized virus neutralization assay allows for cross-cohort comparisons of COVID-19 sera,"The on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has mobilized a global effort to develop vaccines and therapeutics that inhibit viral entry by inducing or transferring antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (CoV2-S). Phase I/II vaccine clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent sera have all shown promise. However, these efforts often require extensive screening with the live virus under onerous high biocontainment conditions (BSL-3). Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) remain the gold standard for evaluating the anti-viral potency of antibodies and entry inhibitors. The proliferation of pseudotyped virus systems that can be used in BSL-2 compatible VNAs is a positive development. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how the findings are presented, making inter-group comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using VSVdeltaG based CoV-2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) that can be robustly produced at scale. We used our CoV2pp to interrogate the role of exogenous and endogenous proteases in CoV-2-S mediated entry and standardized our VNA based on that understanding. Our CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S ELISA and live virus neutralizations in a validated set of patient sera. Our system was subsequently validated by three independent groups as an out-of-the-box VNA. More than 120 patient sera were screened, and we report descriptive statistics for absolute (abs) IC50, IC80, and IC90 values from all positive patient sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2+TMPRSS2. When used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can now produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNA/week.","Oguntuyo, K. Y.; Stevens, C. S.; Hung, C.-T.; Ikegame, S.; Acklin, J.

6,"Epidemics forecast from SIR-modeling, verification and calculated effects of lockdown and lifting of interventions","Due to the current COVID-19 epidemic plague hitting the worldwide population it is of utmost medical, economical and societal interest to gain reliable predictions on the temporal evolution of the spreading of the infectious diseases in human populations. Of particular interest are the daily rates and cumulative number of new infections, as they are monitored in infected societies, and the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions due to different lockdown measures as well as their subsequent lifting on these infections. Estimating quantitatively the influence of a later lifting of the interventions on the resulting increase in the case numbers is important to discriminate this increase from the onset of a second wave. The recently discovered new analytical solutions of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model allow for such forecast and the testing of lockdown and lifting interventions as they hold for arbitrary time dependence of the infection rate.

8,Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Covid 19: A metanalysis of case series studies,"Abstract Background : characteristic feature of COVID-19 during its progression in severity is the cytokine storm (via interleukin-6, IL-6) which is responsible for secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. Tocilizumab has an antagonist effect on the IL-6 receptor. With present review and metanalysis, we intend to update the current status on the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of Covid 19 infections in the published literature of case series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were used: (i) case series studies (number of reported patients in each study equal to or greater than ten (ii) use of tocilizumab alone or in combination with standard of care therapy (iii) Covid 19 adult patients (iv) the studies with endpoints on all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, clinical improvements. Data synthesis and statistical analysis Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the DerSimonian and Laird method. RESULTS 18 were selected for the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). 14 studies were retrospective and 4 were prospective Meta-analysis The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab was 21% (251/1212) Asymmetric funnel plot in the cylindrical form due to publication bias In conclusion the present synthesis provide us useful insights with the other available evidence to refine our strategy and equip ourselves effectively with tocilizumab to defeat COVID 19 to save humanity. Limitations The included studies utilized varied doses of tocilizumab (single or double), and duration drug availability issues emerged in some centers, which may have influenced both sample sizes and study designs. Clinical implications: Incorporated studies without control groups into systematic reviews and quantitative synthesis especially when there are no other studies to consider can provide information for formulating effective treatment strategies for management of COVID 19 infections through the use of tocilizumab.

9,Influence of adherence to social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity level in post-bariatric patients,"Objectives: To assess physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients who adhered or not to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our secondary aim was to compare physical activity estimates between objectively measured and self-reported physical activity level. Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we assessed physical activity level using accelerometers and a validated questionnaire in 33 post-bariatric patients who reported to be adherent (n=15) or not (n=18) to social distancing measures. Results: Patients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary behavior (1.1 hours/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (-12.2 min/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity. Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of 2.8 hours/day and 8.5 min/day, respectively. Conclusion: Post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones. Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rezende, D.; Pinto, A.

10,Comprehensive Systematic Review to Identify putative COVID-19 Treatments: Roles for Immunomodulator and Antiviral Treatments,"Objectives: To identify putative COVID-19 treatments and identify the roles of immunomodulators and antivirals in disease management. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names. Review methods: Inclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19 treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review. Results: 19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues. Conclusions: To date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time, indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers.

11,First report of tocilizumab use in a cohort of Latin American patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia,"Introduction/objectives: An interleukin-6 inhibition strategy could be effective in selected COVID-19 patients. The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1% were men, 37.9% were obese, and 34.5% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of five days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation. Lymphocyte improvement was a predictor of good response.","Valenzuela, O.; Ibanez, S.

12,Tissue-resident memory CD8 T-cell responses elicited by a single injection of a multi-target COVID-19 vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which enters the body principally through the nasal and larynx mucosa and progress to the lungs through the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.","Gauttier, V.; Morello, A.; Girault, I.; Mary, C.; Belarif, L.; Desselle, A.; Wilhelm, E.; Bourquard, T.; Pengam, S.; Teppaz, G.; Thepenier, V.; Biteau, K.; De Barbeyrac, E.; Kiepferle, D.; Vasseur, B.; Le Flem, F.-X.; Debieuvre, D.; Costantini, D.; Poirier, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

14,"Ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells: rapid induction, prolonged contraction, and formation of functional memory","CD8+ T cells are critical for the elimination and long-lasting protection of many viral infections, but their role in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Schulien, I.; Kemming, J.; Oberhardt, V.; Wild, K.; Seidel, L.

15,Hydroxychloroquine: mechanism of action inhibiting SARS-CoV2 entry.,"Background: SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic. Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry. Methods: Viral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 micromolar propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains. Results: Propofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2. Conclusions: We conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ. HCQ disruption of the membrane appears to also disrupt the production of host defense peptide, hence an antimicrobial such as erythromycin could be an important combined treatment. Nonetheless erythromycin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may combine with HCQ to reduce infection.","Yuan, Z.; Pavel, M.

16,Clinical characteristics and Outcomes of 500 patients with COVID Pneumonia : Results from a Single center(Southend University Hospital),"Objectives To characterise the clinical features of hospitalised COVID 19 patients in a single centre during the first epidemic wave and explore potential predictive variables associated with outcomes such as mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, using baseline clinical parameters. Methodology We conducted a retrospective review of electronic records for demographic, clinical and laboratory data, imaging and outcomes for 500 hospitalised patients between February 20th and May 7th 2020 from Southend University Hospital, Essex, UK. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors relevant to outcome. Results The mean age of the cohort admitted to hospital with Covid-19, was 69.4 and 290 (58%) were over 70. The majority were Caucasians, 437 (87%) with less than 2 co-morbidities 280(56%). Most common were hypertension 186(37 %), Cardiovascular disease 178(36 %) and Diabetes 128 (26 %), represented in a larger proportion on the mortality group. Mean CFS was 4 with Non Survivors had significantly higher CFS 5 vs 3 in survivors, p<0.001. In addition, Mean CRP was significantly higher 150 vs 90, p<0.001 in Non Survivors. We observed the baseline predictors for mortality were age, CFS and CRP. Conclusions In this single centre study, older and frailer patients with more comorbidities and a higher baseline CRP and creatinine were risk factors for worse outcomes. Integrated frailty and age based risk stratification are essential, in addition to monitoring SFR (Sp02/Fi02) and inflammatory markers throughout the disease course to allow for early intervention to improve patient outcomes.","Koduri, G.; Gokaraju, S.; Darda, M.; Warrier, V.; Duta, I.; Hayes, F.; El Sayed, I.; Ahmed, Y.

17,Designed Variants of Recombinant ACE2-Fc that Decouple Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities from Unwanted Cardiovascular Effects,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and recombinant ACE2 decoys are being evaluated as new antiviral therapies. We designed and tested an ACE2-Fc fusion protein, which has the benefits of a long pharmacological half-life and the potential to facilitate immune clearance of the virus. Out of the concern that the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 may unintentionally alter the balance of its hormonal substrates and cause adverse cardiovascular effects in treatment, we performed a mutagenesis screening for inactivating the enzyme. Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture. This study established new ACE2-Fc candidates as antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 without potentially harmful side effects from ACE2 catalytic actions toward its vasoactive substrates.","Liu, P.; Xie, X.; Gao, L.; Jin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
18,"A simple numerical and analytical analysis of Covid-19 progression, infection inhibition and control in various countries","Covid-19 disease outspread and its subsequent control and inhibition strategies in various countries have been different which led to quite drastic difference in the outcome of the disease progression. In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 disease spread and control by applying the modified SIR model of epidemic outbreak to explain the Covid spread from February-July 2020 in various countries. Two approaches are evident from the disease progression; one focused on disease eradication and inhibition, and the other is less restrictive dynamic response. Both the approaches are analytically modeled to determine the parameters that characterize the effectiveness of dealing with the disease progression. The model successfully explains the Covid-19 evolution and control of various countries over a vast span of four-five months. The study is highly beneficial to simply analytically and numerically model this complex problem of epidemic proliferation. It assists to easily determine the mathematical parameters for the Covid-19 control measures, helps in predicting the end of the epidemic, and most importantly conceiving the judicious way of unlock process to restore communication between cities, states and countries.","Chakravarty, U.; Chaturvedi, D.; Joshi, M.

19,Local protection bubbles: an interpretation of the decrease in the velocity of coronavirus's spread in the city of Sao Paulo,"After four months of dealing with the pandemic, the city of Sao Paulo entered a phase of relaxed social-distancing measures in July 2020, and saw its social isolation rate fall at the same time as the number of cases, deaths, and hospital bed occupation declined. We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the city's sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the virus's spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the virus's spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the population's transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.","Pinto, J. P. G.; Magalhaes, P.

22,Comprehensive analysis of the key epidemiological parameters to evaluate the impact of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 pandemic,"Globally, the heterogenous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case fatality rate (CFR) could be influenced by various epidemiological parameters. Identifying these could help formulate effective public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July 30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing vs. discontinued/never undertaken), %population aged [&ge;]65 years, incidences of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean {+/-} SD: 3.05% {+/-} 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034, p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008). The epidemiological variables significantly associated with higher COVID-19 event rate were countries with higher %population aged [&ge;]65 years (p<0.001), greater incidence of IHD (p<0.001) and cancer (p=0.003) and better HDI (p=0.003). Incidences of malaria, HHD and diabetes along with population density had no significant impact on COVID-19 CFR. Further, BCG vaccination significantly lowered the COVID-19 ER in each of the high-risk population subgroups - countries with >7.1% population aged [&ge;]65 years (p=0.008), >0.737 HDI (p=0.001), IHD >1171/105 population (p=0.004) and cancer incidence >15726 (p<0.001). The results supports BCG induced trained immunity leading to heterologous immunoprotection against COVID-19. Thus BCG vaccination with early strains could provide a cost-effective prophylaxis, especially in high-risk individuals and bridge the gap till an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is freely available globally.","Datta, N.

23,Differential methylation as a mediator of COVID-19 susceptibility,"The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","Steyaert, S.; Trooskens, G.; Delanghe, J.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs.

27,Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","Papa, G.; Mallery, D.; Albecka, A.; Welch, L.; Cattin-Ortola, J.; Luptak, J.; Paul, D.; McMahon, H.; Goodfellow, I.

28,Extensive Genetic Diversity and Host Range of Rodent-borne Coronaviruses,"To better understand the genetic diversity, host association and evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) in China we analyzed a total of 696 rodents encompassing 16 different species sampled from Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome.

29,Metaviromic identification of genetic hotspots of coronavirus pathogenicity using machine learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major threat across the globe. Here, we developed machine learning approaches to identify key pathogenic regions in coronavirus genomes. We trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","Park, J.

30,Methylation of RNA Cap in SARS-CoV-2 captured by serial crystallography,"The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contains 29 proteins, of which 15 are nonstructural. Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5' terminus. In the methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'- O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.","Wilamowski, M.; Sherrell, D.; Minasova, G.; Kim, Y.; Shuvaloca, L.; Lavens, A.; Chard, R.; Maltseva, N.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Rosas-Lemus, M.; Saint, N.; Foster, I.

31,Pandemic danger to the deep: the risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater,"We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. Many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we highlight the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","Mathavarajah, S.; Stoddart, A.

32,"Discovery of Clioquinol and Analogues as Novel Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection, ACE2 and ACE2 - Spike Protein Interaction In Vitro","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as an ongoing global pandemic. Presently, there are no clinically approved vaccines nor drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Here in, we discovered Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a FDA approved drug and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral activity showing strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction. Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for clinical development of potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Olaleye, O.

33,SRSF protein kinases 1 and 2 are essential host factors for human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2,"Antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to treat the pandemic disease COVID-19. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. Here, we used a genome-wide loss of function CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human lung epithelial cells to identify potential host therapeutic targets. Validation of our screening hits revealed that the kinase SRPK1, together with the closely related SRPK2, were jointly essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication; inhibition of SRPK1/2 with small molecules led to a dramatic decrease (more than 100,000-fold) in SARS-CoV-2 virus production in immortalized and primary human lung cells. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that SPRK1/2 phosphorylate the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at sites highly conserved across human coronaviruses and, due to this conservation, even a distantly related coronavirus was highly sensitive to an SPRK1/2 inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that SRPK1/2-targeted therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.","Heaton, B. E.; Trimarco, J.

34,Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By T Cell Epitope Engineering,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes' similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S protein's immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the protein's native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigen's structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","Ong, E.; Huang, X.; Pearce, R.; Zhang, Y.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
35,In Silico Design of siRNAs Targeting Existing and Future Respiratory Viruses with VirusSi,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed global inadequacies in therapeutic options against both the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus and other newly emerged respiratory viruses. In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","Zhang, D.; Lu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
36,Investigation of pooling strategies using clinical COVID-19 samples for more efficient diagnostic testing,"When testing large numbers of clinical COVID-19 samples for diagnostic purposes, pooling samples together for processing can offer significant reductions in the materials, reagents, time, and labor needed. We have evaluated two different strategies for pooling independent nasopharyngeal swab samples prior to testing with an EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR diagnostic assay. First, in the Dilution Study, we assessed the assay's ability to detect a single positive clinical sample diluted in multiple negative samples before the viral RNA extraction stage. We observed that positive samples with Ct values at ~30 can be reliably detected in pools of up to 30 independent samples, and positive samples with Ct values at ~35 can be detected in pools of 5 samples. Second, in the Reloading Study, we assessed the efficacy of reloading QIAamp viral RNA extraction columns numerous times using a single positive sample and multiple negative samples. We determined that one RNA extraction column can be reloaded with up to 20 clinical samples (1 positive and 19 negatives) sequentially without any loss of signal in the diagnostic assay. Furthermore, we found there was no significant difference in assay readout whether the positive sample was loaded first or last in a series of 20 samples. These results demonstrate that different pooling strategies can lead to increased process efficiencies for COVID-19 clinical diagnostic testing.","Adikari, S. H.; Alipio Lyon, E. Z.; Hollander, A.

As in USA and elsewhere, disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3%) and April (47.5%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90% (0.86, 0.94).

Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas 6800 instrument. Methods: Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix) in comparison to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test. Results: 22/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix and cobas assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas 6800 (1/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/VTM and plasma samples. Conclusions: Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.","Matic, N.; Lawson, T.; Ritchie, G.; Stefanovic, A.; Leung, V.; Champagne, S.; Romney, M.

41,"In the face of the pandemic, are all equal? On the suitability of the Gini index to monitor time and geographic trends in incidence and death during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","Health inequalities across nations reinforce social and economic differences. The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a society's life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional). We aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related incidences and deaths using the Gini index (GI) that was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. The GI is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where everybody owns the same, GI=1 corresponds to one person owning the entire wealth of a society. A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of case-fatality rates. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the heterogeneity at different levels. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the global distribution of incidences and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total incidence and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends on national level reflect local outbreaks. There is heterogeneity in case fatality rates, too. There is also a specific numeric artefact of the GI: Even if many smaller regions have no COVID-19 related deaths at all, and one region has low (but still non-negligible) number of deaths the corresponding GI is near to 1. We used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. However, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.","Manz, K.; Mansmann, U.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174011v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
42,"To what extent physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures being implemented among people in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia: exploring evidence for an urgent call for action?","Background The number of confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surge substantially in resource-poor settings within the fragile health system. Since there are no proven vaccine and treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30 June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist. Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Results Of the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6) on preventive measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks. Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprints up to July 20, 2020. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CST. We pooled adjusted effect estimates of mortality and other outcomes using a random effect model, among studies at low or moderate risk for bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Results: Out of 1067 citations screened for eligibility, one RCT and 19 cohort studies were included (16,977 hospitalized patients). Ten studies (1 RCT and 9 cohorts) with 10,278 patients examined the effect of CST on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.69-1.22, I2=81.94 %). This effect was observed across all stages of disease severity. Four cohort studies examined the effect of CST on composite outcome of death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation need. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.41(0.23-0.73, I2=78.69%). Six cohort studies examined the effect of CST on delayed viral clearance. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.47(95% CI 1.11-1.93, I2=43.38%). Conclusion: Heterogeneous and low certainty cumulative evidence suggests that CST lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality while possibly delaying viral clearance in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Because of the discordant results between the single RCT and observational studies, more research should continue to identify the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients population that could benefit from CST.","Tlayjeh, H.; Mhish, O.; Enani, M.; Alruwaili, A.; Tleyjeh, R.; Thalib, L.; Hassett, L.; Arabi, Y.; Kashour, T.; Tleyjeh, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174201v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174201v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True

In the fully adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.65-0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use. Conclusion and Relevance: We found no evidence of a harmful effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths. Risks from COVID-19 do not need to influence decisions about therapeutic use of NSAIDs.","Wong, A. Y.; MacKenna, B.; Morton, C.; Schultze, A.; Walker, A. J.; Bhaskaran, K.; Brown, J.; Rentsch, C.

45,A novel approach for evaluating contact patterns and risk mitigation strategies for COVID-19 in English Primary Schools with application of Structured Expert Judgement,"Background Contact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","Sparks, S.

46,Hospital preparedness in epidemics by using simulation. The case of COVID-19,"This paper presents a discrete event simulation model to support the decision-making concerned with the short-term planning of the necessary hospital resources, especially Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, to face outbreaks, as the SARS-CoV-2. Being used as a short-term forecasting tool, the simulation model requires an accurate representation of the current system state and high fidelity in mimicking the system dynamics from that state. The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of the admission of new patients and the patient flow through the hospital facilities. For the patient arrival process, we analyze different models based on growth curves of the twenty most affected countries (until June 15) and propose the use of the Gompertz curve. The length of stay is divided into several stages, each one modeled separately. We analyze the starting of the simulation model, which requires different procedures depending on the information available about the patients currently hospitalized. We also report the use of this simulation model during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, in Spain. Every day, the research team informed the regional logistic team in charge of planning the health resources, who programmed the ward and ICU beds based on the resulting predictions.","Garcia-Vicuna, D.; Esparza, L.; Mallor, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173328v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173328v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
47,Challenges and proposed solutions in making clinical research on COVID-19 ethical. A status quo analysis across German research ethics committees,"Background: In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the biomedical research community's attempt to focus the attention on fighting COVID-19, led to several challenges within the field of research ethics. However, we know little about the practical relevance of these challenges for Research Ethics Committees (RECs). Methods: We conducted a qualitative survey across all 52 German RECs on the challenges and potential solutions with reviewing proposals for COVID-19 studies. We de-identified the answers and applied thematic text analysis for the extraction and synthesis of challenges and potential solutions that we grouped under established principles for clinical research ethics. Results: We received an overall response rate of 42%. The 22 responding RECs reported that they had assessed a total of 441 study proposals on COVID-19 until 21 April 2020. For the review of these proposals the RECs indicated a broad spectrum of challenges regarding i) social value (e.g. lack of coordination), ii) scientific validity (e.g. provisional study planning), iii) favourable risk-benefit ratio (e.g. difficult benefit assessment), iv) informed consent (e.g. strict isolation measures), v) independent review (e.g. lack of time), vi) fair selection of trial participants (e.g. inclusion of vulnerable groups), and vii) respect for study participants (e.g. data security). Mentioned solutions ranged from improved local/national coordination, over guidance on modified consent procedures, to priority setting across clinical studies. Conclusions: RECs are facing a broad spectrum of pressing challenges in reviewing COVID-19 studies. Some challenges for consent procedures are well known from research in intensive care settings but are further aggravated by infection measures. Other challenges such as reviewing several clinical studies at the same time that potentially compete for the recruitment of in-house COVID-19 patients are unique to the current situation. For some of the challenges the proposed solutions in our survey could relatively easy be translated into practice. Others need further conceptual and empirical research. Our findings together with the increasing body of literature on COVID-19 research ethics, and further stakeholder engagement should inform the development of hands-on guidance for researchers, funders, RECs, and further oversight bodies.","Faust, A.; Sierawska, A.; Krueger, K.; Wisgalla, A.; Hasford, J.; Strech, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20168773v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20168773v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
48,Deep Learning for Automated Recognition of Covid-19 from Chest X-ray Images,"Abstract Background: The pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect, which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency. Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treat- ments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diag- nosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classifica- tion engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,our approach always yields an accuracy larger than 95.0%, with the maximum accuracy obtained being 96.64%. Conclusions: As a comparison with various existing studies, we can thus conclude that our performance improvement is significant.","Nguyen, P.; Iovino, L.; Flammini, M.; Linh, L.

49,"Effect of covid-19 lockdown on child protection medical assessments: a retrospective observational study in Birmingham, UK.","Objectives To determine any change in referral patterns and outcomes in children (0-18) referred for child protection medical examination (CPME) during the covid-19 pandemic compared to previous years. Design Retrospective observational study, analysing routinely collected clinical data from CPME reports in a rapid response to the pandemic lockdown. Setting Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides all routine CPME for Birmingham, England, population 1.1 million including 288,000 children. Participants Children aged under 18 years attending CPME during an 18 week period from late February to late June during the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Main Outcome Measures Numbers of referrals, source of disclosure and outcomes from CPME Results There were 78 CPME referrals in 2018, 75 in 2019 and 47 in 2020, this was a 39.7% (95%CI 12.4-59.0) reduction in referrals from 2018 to 2020, and a 37.3% (95%CI 8.6-57.4) reduction from 2019 to 2020. There were fewer CPME referrals initiated by school staff in 2020, 12(26%) compared to 36 (47%) and 38 (52%) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. In all years 75.9% of children were known to social care prior to CPME, and 94% of CPME concluded that there were significant safeguarding concerns. Conclusions School closure due to covid-19 may have harmed children as child abuse has remained hidden. There needs to be either mandatory attendance at schools in future or viable alternatives found. There may be a significant increase in safeguarding referrals when schools fully re-open as children disclose the abuse they have experienced at home.","Garstang, J.; Debelle, G.; Anand, I.; Armstrong, J.; Botcher, E.; Chaplin, H.; Hallett, N.; Morgans, C.; Price, M.; Tan, E.

50,Evaluating the impacts of release in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) on the epidemic of covid-19 based on mathematical model,"To flatten the curve of the natural epidemic of covid-19, many countries adopted lockdown or isolation resulting in the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, an important question arises about the strategies of release of isolated persons to avoid overloaded hospitals and increased deaths. Sao Paulo State (Brazil) implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on March 24, and the progressive flexibilization considering the characteristics of each location (release of the isolated population) initiated on June 15. A mathematical model based on the natural history of covid-19 was applied to describe the epidemiological scenario with isolation in Sao Paulo State, and assess the impact of release on the covid-19 epidemic. Using data collected from Sao Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters to obtain the curves of the epidemic, the number of deaths, and the clinical evolution of covid-19. The epidemic under isolation was the framework to evaluate the strategies of the release, that is, how these curves are changed with the release of isolated persons. We evaluated three strategies of release. First two strategies considered four releases in the isolated population in four equal proportions, but successive releases elapsed by 14 and 21 days. In each strategy the beginning of the release was on June 29 and July 13, when the effective reproduction number Ref was evaluated. The third strategy aimed at the protection of the elder subpopulation. We observed that the delay to begin the release and the increased elapse between successive releases resulted in a better scenario by decreasing severe covid-19 cases and, consequently, to avoid overloaded hospitals. We also observed that the release delayed to achieve lower values for Ref and infectious persons retarded in several months the quick increasing phase of the forthcoming epidemic. However, this epidemic can be flattened or even suppressed by isolation of infectious persons by mass testing and/or by rigid adoption of protective measures and social distancing.","Yang, H.

51,"COVID-19 vaccination intention in the UK: Results from the COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptability Study (CoVAccS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey","Aim: To investigate factors associated with intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available to you and socio-demographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Campaigns and messaging about a COVID-19 vaccination should emphasize the risk of COVID-19 to others and necessity for everyone to be vaccinated.","Sherman, S. M.; Smith, L.

52,The cost-effectiveness of common strategies for the prevention of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in universities.,"Background. As universities re-open, it is imperative to understand the added value of measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of common public health interventions used by universities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We use a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations, cycling once per day. The model computes changes in infection among interacting groups of university affiliates both on and off campus. Interventions are compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines at three different levels of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university in terms of incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results. When there are 100 infectious cases per 100,000 people in the community (0.1%), a symptom-checking mobile application is cost-effective relative to CDC guidelines alone. If the community active infectious case rate reaches 1%, providing high quality, 2-ply masks will be cost-saving. As the community prevalence rate of infectious cases reaches 2%, thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070/QALY gained (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821 QALY gained, $2.15 million/QALY gained). One-time PCR testing on entry costs $1.08 million/QALY gained (95% CrI = $170,703 QALY gained, $3.33 million/QALY gained). Weekly PCR testing costs $820,119 /QALY gained (95% CrI = $452,673 QALY gained, $1.68 million/QALY gained). Upgrades to ventilation systems or installation of far-UVC light systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY gained if aerosols account for 86% of all on-campus transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. The value of commonly used interventions for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 varies greatly with the rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university.","Zafari, Z.; Muennig, P.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20166975v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20166975v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True

Containing the pandemic hinged on combinations of social distancing and face mask use. Here we examine the efficacy of these measures, using an agent-based modeling approach that evaluates face masks and social distancing in realistic confined spaces scenarios. We find face masks are more effective than social distancing. Importantly, combining face masks with even moderate social distancing provides optimal protection.

54,Analysis of the intestinal microbiota in COVID-19 patients and its correlation with the inflammatory factor IL-18 and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA,"The current global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by beta coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which already infected over 10 million and caused 500 thousand deaths by June 2020. Overproduction of cytokines triggered by COVID-19 infection, known as ""cytokine storm"", is a highly risk factor associated with disease severity. However, how COVID-19 infection induce cytokine storm is still largely unknown. Accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that gut is also susceptible to COVID19 infection: Human intestinal organoids, an in vitro model which mimic the specific cell type and spatial structure of the intestine, were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection; A significant fraction of patients reported gut symptoms; Viral RNA may persist for more than 30 days and infectious virus could be isolated in fecal samples. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system with symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms. The bacteria resident in our gastrointestinal tract, known as gut microbiota, is important to maintain the homeostasis of our immune system. While imbalance of gut microbiota, or dysbiosis, is associated with multiple inflammation diseases5. It's possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to alternation of gut microbiota thus worsen the host symptom. IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced multiple enteric cells, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), immune cells as well as enteric nervous system, and was shown to increase in the serum of COVID-19 patients. Immunoglobin A (IgA) is mainly produced in the mucosal surfaces, in humans 40-60mg kg-1 day-1 than all other immunoglobulin isotypes combined, and at least 80% of all plasma cells are located in the intestinal lamina propria. Recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the serum is positively correlate with the disease severity in COVID-19 patients11.

55,Mass screening of asymptomatic persons for SARS-CoV-2 using saliva,"Background COVID-19 has rapidly evolved to become a global pandemic due largely to the transmission of its causative virus through asymptomatic carriers. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. Methods We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using NPS and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. Results In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence, 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva. Conclusion Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity.

Here we test the suitability of different RNA extraction methods for integration into a diagnostic workflow for coronavirus testing. Methods: We applied six RNA extraction methods on the same 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples and quantified their results by subsequent reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of three viral genes. These methods included a) column-based extraction, b) phenol-chloroform extraction, as well as c) extraction using magnetic beads (i.e., one commercial kit as well as three different magnetic beads in combination with home-brewed buffers and solutions). Results: We achieved diagnostic-quality RT-PCR results with all methods, and there was no significant difference between the tested methods, except for one magnetic bead protocol with home-brewed buffers, in which the number of positive tested genes was significantly lower. Conclusions: Five of the six RNA extraction methods are interchangeable in a diagnostic workflow. Since some methods are more scalable than others, and have comparable results on RT-PCR quantitation, they may be more amenable to high-throughput sample processing pipelines.","Eichhoff, O.

57,Causal associations between COVID-19 and Atrial Fibrillation: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study,"Abstract Background Observational studies showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attacks universally and its most menacing progression uniquely endangers the elderly with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether COVID-19 is causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of atrial fibrillation (AF), the main form of CVD, remains still unknown. Methods The study aims to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of COVID-19 with AF using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results MR evidence suggested genetically predicted severe COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher risk of AF (odds ratio [OR], 1.041; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.007-1.076; P = 0.017), while genetically predicted AF was not causally associated with severe COVID-19 (OR, 0.831; 95% CI, 1.619-1.115; P=0.217). There was limited evidence to support association of genetically proxied COVID-19 with risk of AF (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 0.991-1.114; P=0.097), and vice versa (OR, 0.163; 95% CI, 0.004-6.790; P=0.341). MR-Egger indicated no evidence of pleiotropic bias. Conclusion Overall, severe COVID-19 may causally affect AF through independent biological pathway.

Hence, this study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among ophthalmic HCP towards COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of lockdown among ophthalmic HCP including consultant ophthalmologist, resident, optometrist, ophthalmic assistant, nursing staff, and other paramedics of eye care centers in Nepal. The KAP questionnaire was designed and distributed online. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, and binary logistic regression. All tests were performed at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 694 participants, the majority were male (59.1%) from the age group 31-40 years (41.5%) and tertiary eye center (68.9%). Among ophthalmic HCP, there were 29.8% consultants ophthalmologist, 22.6% residents, 23.3% optometrist, 15% ophthalmic assistant, and 9.2% other ophthalmic paramedics, 11.7% working as front-liners in COVID-19 centers. Findings showed, 98.1% had good knowledge, 59.4% had a positive attitude and only 13.3% had good practice regarding COVID-19. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated the age of HCP to be a significant determinant of good knowledge (Crude Odds Ratio (COR)=0.72, 95%CI=0.62-0.82), positive attitude (COR=0.92, 95%CI=0.90-0.94) and good practice (COR=1.16, 95%CI=1.10-1.21). Lower odds of poor practice was seen among junior resident (COR=0.26, 95% CI=0.14-0.47) and higher odds of poor practice was seen among HCP with job experience of 5-10 years (COR=2.38, 95% CI=1.23-4.60) towards COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The majority of ophthalmic HCP have good knowledge, insufficient positive attitude, and inadequate evidence-based practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Hence, this study conclusively recommends to modify existing guidelines and formulate new policies to improve KAP among ophthalmic HCP to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.","Ansari, D.

59,"Results and Impact of Intensive SARS-CoV-2 Testing in a High Volume, Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinic in a Pandemic Hotspot","Background: In an attempt to reduce interruptions in radiation treatment, our department implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing during the peak of the New York City COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Starting 4/18/20, outpatients coming into the Department of Radiation Oncology for either simulation or brachytherapy were required to undergo PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Starting on 5/6/20, patients were offered simultaneous SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody testing. Results: Between 4/18/20-6/25/20, 1360 patients underwent 1,401 outpatient screening visits (Table 1). Of the patients screened, 411 were screened between 4/18/20 and 5/6/20 (Phase 1) with PCR testing: 13 (3.1%) patients were PCR positive. From 5/7/20 to 6/25/20, 990 patients were scheduled for both PCR and antibody testing (Phase 2), including 41 previously screened in Phase 1. Of those with known antibody status (n=952), 5.5% were seropositive. After 5/21/20, no screened patient (n=605) tested PCR positive. In the month prior to screening (3/17/20-4/19/20), 24 of 625 patients initiating external radiation had treatment interrupted due to COVID-19 infection (3.8%) vs 7 of 600 patients (1.1%) in the month post screening (4/20/20-5/24/20) (p=0.002). Conclusions: State-wide mitigation efforts, coupled with intensive departmental screening, helped prevent interruptions in radiation during the COVID-19 epidemic that could have compromised treatment efficacy.","McBride, S.

60,Identification on Admission of COVID-19 Patients at Risk of Subsequent Rapid Clinical Deterioration,"Introduction: Recent localized surges in COVID-19 cases have resulted in the hospitals serving those areas being overwhelmed. In such cases, the ability to rapidly and objectively determine a patient's acuity and predict near-term care needs is a major challenge. At issue is the clinician's ability to correctly identify patients at risk for subsequent rapid clinical deterioration. Data-driven tools that can support such determinations in real-time may be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgement during COVID-19 surges. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Rothman Index (RI) predictive model in distinguishing the risk of subsequent deterioration or elevated care needs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We evaluated the initial RI score on admission to predict COVID-19 patient risk for 216 COVID-19 patients discharged from March 21st to June 7th, 2020 at Sinai LifeBridge Hospital and 1,453 COVID-19 patients discharged from any of Yale New Haven Health System's Yale New Haven, Bridgeport, and Greenwich hospitals from April 1st to April 28th, 2020. In-hospital mortality as a function of age and RI on admission for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were compared. AUC values using each COVID-19 patient's initial RI on admission to predict in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU utilization were computed, as were precision and recall for mortality prediction at specific RI thresholds. Results: The RI computed at the time of admission provides a high degree of objective discrimination to differentiate the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations at the outset of hospitalization. The high risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 20-30% of the COVID-19 positive population with mortality rates from 40-50%. The low risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 40%-55% of the population with mortality rates ranging from 1%-8%. Of note is that COVID-19 patients who present with heightened but generally unremarkable acuity can be identified early as having considerably elevated risk for subsequent physiological deterioration. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated mortality rates compared to non-COVID-19 medical service patients and may be subject to rapid deterioration following hospital admission. A lack of predictive indicators for identifying patients at high risk of subsequent deterioration or death can pose a challenge to clinicians. The RI has excellent performance characteristics when stratifying risk among COVID-19 patients at the time of admission. The RI can assist clinicians in real-time with a high degree of objective discrimination by segmenting the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations. This supports rapid and optimal patient bed assignment and resource allocation.","Beals, J.; Barnes, J.; Durand, D.; Rimar, J.; Donohue, T.; Hoq, M.; Belk, K.; Amin, A.; Rothman, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20171751v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20171751v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True

62,The operational impact of deploying SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in countries of the WHO African Region,"Background: After SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available, they will be deployed to many countries with limited immunization systems. Methods: We conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARS-CoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. Findings: Compared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region. Funding: None","Ortiz, J.

65,"Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Covid-19 pandemic: a global socioeconomic analysis","Socioeconomic achievement of WASH (access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services are being acknowledged as anticipatory actors, indispensable in safeguarding health during this Covid19 pandemic. However, on a global scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non obtainability of which of the various WASH services are closely related to Covid19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analyzed data (March to June 2020) related to five Covid19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with indicators of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to understand this. We have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects of Covid19 and better access to safe water, sanitation as well as hygiene throughout this time for most of the indicators. However, some indicators show the opposite nature of the relationship, for which we have given probable explanation accordingly. The hypothesis of an inversely proportional association between Covid-19 and poor WASH facilities on a global scale is confirmed in this study. We propose that this study should be perceived as an expanded comprehensive view on the complexities of WASH and Covid19 interrelationships, which could help to shape an agenda for research into some unanswered questions.","Roy, A.; Basu, A.; Pramanick, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173179v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173179v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True

67,Assessing the risk of COVID-19 importation and the effect of quarantine,"## Objectives During the early stage of COVID-19 spread, many governments and regional jurisdictions put in place travel restrictions and imposed quarantine after arrivals in an effort to slow down or stop the importation of cases. At the same time, they implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to curtail local spread. We assess the risk of importation of COVID-19 in locations that are at that point without infection or where local chains of transmission have extinguished, and evaluate the role of quarantine in this risk. ## Methods A stochastic $SLIAR$ epidemic model is used. The effect of the rate, size, and nature of importations is studied and compared to that of NPI on the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains. The effect of quarantine on the rate of importations is assessed, as well as its efficacy as a function of its duration. ## Results The rate of importations plays a critical role in determining the risk that case importations lead to local transmission chains, more so than local transmission characteristics, i.e., strength of NPI. The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations. ## Conclusions Locations that see no or low level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low. A high level of compliance with post-arrival quarantine followed by testing achieves this objective with less of an impact than travel restrictions or bans.","Arino, J.; Bajeux, N.; Portet, S.; Watmough, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173658v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173658v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
68,Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 exhibit strong association with increased genome-wide mutation load,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for human cases of COVID-19, a pandemic with global impact that first emerged in late 2019. Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Oktay, Y.; Karakülah, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,False
69,Attenuated influenza virions expressing the SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain induce neutralizing antibodies in mice,"An effective vaccine is essential to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we describe an influenza-virus-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. We incorporated a membrane-anchored form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in place of the neuraminidase (NA) coding sequence in an influenza virus also possessing a mutation that reduces the affinity of hemagglutinin for its sialic acid receptor. The resulting {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu virus can be generated by reverse genetics and grown to high titers in cell culture. A single-dose intranasal inoculation of mice with {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu elicits serum neutralizing antibody titers against SAR-CoV-2 comparable to those observed in humans following natural infection (~1:250). Furthermore, {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu itself causes no apparent disease in mice.

70,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike harbours a lipid binding pocket which modulates stability of the prefusion trimer,"Large trimeric Spikes decorate SARS-CoV-2 and bind host cells via receptor binding domains (RBDs). We report a conformation in which the trimer is locked into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the locked form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity/pathogenicity of released virus. These results reveal a potentially druggable pocket and suggest that the natural prefusion state occludes neutralising RBD epitopes, achieving conformational shielding from antibodies.","Carrique, L.; Duyvesteyn, H.

The screen identified 4 FDA-approved small molecules, Maraviroc, FTY720 (Fingolimod), Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Confocal microscopy with over expressed S protein demonstrated that Maraviroc reduced the extent of S-protein mediated cell fusion as observed by fewer multinucleate cells in drug-treated cells. Mathematical modeling of drug-dependent viral multiplication dynamics revealed that prolonged drug treatment will exert an exponential decrease in viral load in a multicellular/tissue environment.

Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3'-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baddock, H.

73,TRIM28 regulates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by targeting ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into human cells. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs.

74,Membrane Nanoparticles Derived from ACE2-rich Cells Block SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic worldwide necessitates the development of novel effective agents against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells. Our study demonstrates a easy-to-acheive memrbane nano-antagonist for curbing SARS-CoV-2, which enriches the existing antiviral arsenal and provides new possibilities to treat COVID-19.

75,Suppression of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses by NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.

ImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Wang, P.; Li, X.; Kuang, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
76,Worldwide tracing of mutations and the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.","Zhou, Z.-Y.; Liu, H.; Zhang, Y.-D.; Wu, Y.-Q.; Peng, M.-S.; Li, A.; Irwin, D.

77,Efficacy of Targeting SARS-CoV-2 by CAR-NK Cells,"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is one of greatest global pandemics in history. No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Ma, M.

78,Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Lung Organoids: a Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Drug Test,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication, assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","Pei, R.; Feng, J.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, H.; Li, L.; Yang, X.; He, J.; Xiao, S.; Xiong, J.; Lin, Y.; Wen, K.; Zhou, H.; Chen, J.; Rong, Z.; Chen, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
79,Discovery of COVID-19 Inhibitors Targeting the SARS-CoV2 Nsp13 Helicase,"The raging COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 has infected millions of people and killed several hundred thousand patients worldwide. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating coronavirus infections. In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved non-structural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP binding site. Importantly, two of our top drug hits have significant activity in inhibiting purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 helicase, providing hope that these drugs can be potentially repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.","White, M.

80,Rapid endothelialitis and vascular inflammation characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung-on-chip model,"BackgroundSevere manifestations of COVID-19 include hypercoagulopathies and systemic endothelialitis. The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.

MethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.

InterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.

81,Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2,"A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is urgently needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","Walls, A.

82,Coronacept - a potent immunoadhesin against SARS-CoV-2,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computational analysis of mammalian ACE2 orthologues suggests various residues at the interface with the viral receptor binding domain that could facilitate tighter interaction compared to the human-ACE2.

84,Cryo-EM Structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Endoribonuclease Nsp15,"New therapeutics are urgently needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the on-going Covid-19 pandemic. Nsp15, a uridine-specific endoribonuclease found in all coronaviruses, processes viral RNA to evade detection by RNA-activated host defense systems, making it a promising drug target. Previous work with SARS-CoV-1 established that Nsp15 is active as a hexamer, yet how Nsp15 recognizes and processes viral RNA remains unknown. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. The UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction at 3.36 [A] resolution provides molecular details into how critical residues within the Nsp15 active site recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond, whereas the apo-states reveal active site conformational heterogeneity. We further demonstrate the specificity and mechanism of nuclease activity by analyzing Nsp15 products using mass spectrometry. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.","Pillon, M. C.; Frazier, M.

Our study is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated biological processes of COVID-19 using a bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression profiles of the GSE152075 datasets were originally produced by using the high-throughput Illumina NextSeq 500. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways.

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins were considered a potential intermediate host. To assemble the coronavirus found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 were used a reference genome in most of studies, assuming that pangolins CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in the evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Y.; Yan, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
87,Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, G.; Kenney, A.

A potent antiviral drug is yet to be discovered. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, secreted by exocrine glands and neutrophils, possesses an antiviral activity extendable to SARS-Cov-2. We performed a randomized, prospective, interventional study assessing the role of oral and intra-nasal lactoferrin to treat mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to prevent disease evolution. Lactoferrin induced an early viral clearance and a fast clinical symptoms recovery in addition to a statistically significant reduction of D-Dimer, Interleukin-6 and ferritin blood levels. The antiviral activity of lactoferrin related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells and protein-protein docking methods, provided the direct recognition between lactoferrin and spike S, thus hindering the spike S attachment to the human ACE2 receptor and consequently virus entering into the cells.

89,Development of CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as a subunit vaccine against COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, T.-Y.; Lin, M.-Y.; Coffman, R. L.; Campbell, J.

90,Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.

Author summaryThe outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","Gruca, A.; Ziemska-Legiecka, J.; Jarnot, P.; Sarnowska, E.; Sarnowski, T.; Grynberg, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
91,K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","Yinda, C.

92,Ambroxol and Ciprofloxacin Show Activity Against SARS-CoV2 in Vero E6 Cells at Clinically-Relevant Concentrations,"We studied the activity of a range of weakly basic and moderately lipophilic drugs against SARS CoV2 in Vero E6 cells, using Vero E6 survival, qPCR of viral genome and plaque forming assays. No clear relationship between their weakly basic and hydrophobic nature upon their activity was observed. However, the approved drugs ambroxol and ciprofloxacin showed potent activity at concentrations that are clinically relevant and within their known safety profiles, and so may provide potentially useful agents for preclinical and clinical studies in COVID-19.","Timmins, G.

93,Nonstructural protein 1 of SARS-CoV-2 is a potent pathogenicity factor redirecting host protein synthesis machinery toward viral RNA.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.

94,SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and serology testing of COVID-19 convalescent plasma from donors with non-severe disease,"We determined the antigen binding activity of convalescent plasma units from 47 individuals with a history of non-severe COVID-19 using three clinical diagnostic serology assays (Beckman, DiaSorin, and Roche) with different SARS-CoV-2 targets. We compared these results with functional neutralization activity using a fluorescent reporter strain of SARS-CoV-2 in a microwell assay. This revealed positive correlations of varying strength (Spearman r = 0.37-0.52) between binding and neutralization. Donors age 48-75 had the highest neutralization activity. Units in the highest tertile of binding activity for each assay were enriched (75-82%) for those with the highest levels of neutralization.","Gniadek, T. J.; Thiede, J. M.; Matchett, W. E.; Gress, A.

95,The interplay of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and constraints imposed by the structure and functionality of its proteins,Fast evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides us with unique information about the patterns of genetic changes in a single pathogen in the timescale of months. This data is used extensively to track the phylodynamic of the pandemics spread and its split into distinct clades. Here we show that the patterns of SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations along its genome are closely correlated with the structural features of the coded proteins. We show that the foldability of proteins 3D structures and conservation of their functions are the universal factors driving evolutionary selection in protein-coding genes. Insights from the analysis of mutation distribution in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins structures and functions have practical implications including evaluating potential antigen epitopes or selection of primers for PCR-based COVID-19 tests.,"Jaroszewski, L.; Iyer, M.; Alisoltani, A.; Sedova, M.; Godzik, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244756v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244756v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
96,Sofosbuvir Terminated RNA is More Resistant to SARS-CoV-2 Proofreader than RNA Terminated by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jockusch, S.; Tao, C.; Li, X.; Chien, M.; Kumar, S.; Morozova, I.; Kalachikov, S.; Russo, J.

97,Ebselen Reacts with SARS Coronavirus-2 Main Protease Crystals,"The SARS coronavirus 2 main protease 3CLpro tailor cuts various essential virus proteins out of long poly-protein translated from the virus RNA. If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the functional virus proteins cannot form and the virus cannot replicate and assemble. Any compound that inhibits the 3CLpro is therefore a potential drug to end the pandemic. Here we show that the diffraction power of 3CLpro crystals is effectively destroyed by Ebselen. It appears that Ebselen may be a widely available, relatively cost effective way to eliminate the SARS coronavirus 2.","Malla, T.

98,Bi-paratopic and multivalent human VH domains neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting distinct epitopes within the ACE2 binding interface of Spike,"Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","Bracken, C.

99,An ultra-high affinity synthetic nanobody blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection by locking Spike into an inactive conformation,"Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","Schoof, M.; Faust, B.; Saunders, R.
