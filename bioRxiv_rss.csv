0,COVID-19 Mortality in Cancer Patients: A Report from a Tertiary Cancer Centre in India,"Background: Cancer patients, especially those receiving cytotoxic therapy are assumed to have a higher probability of death from COVID-19. We have conducted this study to identify the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in cancer patients with COVID-19 and have explored the relationship of various clinical factors to mortality in our patient cohort. Methods: All active cancer cases presented to the hospital from 8th June to 24 August 2020, and developed symptoms/ radiological features suspicious of COVID-19 were tested by Real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and/or cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from a combination of naso-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical data, treatment details, and outcomes were assessed from the medical records. Results: Of the total 3101 cancer patients admitted to the hospital, 1088 patients were tested and 186 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CFR in the cohort was 27/186 (14.5%). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of death was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities [OR: 2.68; (95%CI: 1.13-6.32); P=0.02], multiple comorbidities [OR: 3.01; (95%CI: 1.02-9.07); P=0.046 for multiple vs. single], and the severity of COVID-19 presentation [OR: 27.48; (95%CI: 5.34-141.49); P=0.0001 for severe vs. not severe]. Among all comorbidities, diabetes [OR: 3.3; (95%CI: 1.35-8.09); P=0.008] and cardiovascular diseases [OR: 3.77; (95%CI: 1.02-13.91); P=0.045] were significant risk factors for death. The receipt of anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy within a month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms had no significant effect on the mortality of cancer patients. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from India reporting the CFR, clinical associations, and risk factors for mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients. Our study shows that the frequency of COVID-19 in cancer patients is high, and the CFR is 7.6 times more than the national average. Anticancer therapies did not increase the risk of death. Pre-existing comorbidities specially diabetes, multiple comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 presenting symptoms are significantly linked with COVID-19 related death in the cohort.","Mehta, A.; Vasudevan, S.; Parkash, A.; Sharma, A.; Vashist, T.; Krishna, V.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20194092v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.20194092v1?rss=1,2020-09-15,2020-09-15,,True
1,LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AS A RISK FACTOR FOR SEVERE COVID-19 IN ADULTS,"The identification of factors predisposing to severe COVID-19 in young adults remains partially characterized. Low birth weight (LBW) alters cardiovascular and lung development and predisposes to adult disease. We hypothesized that LBW is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-elderly subjects. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 397 patients (18-70y) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection attended in a tertiary hospital, where 15% required admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Perinatal and current potentially predictive variables were obtained from all patients and LBW was defined as birth weight [&le;]2,500 g. Age (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.04 [1-1.07], P=0.012), male sex (aOR 3.39 [1.72-6.67], P<0.001), hypertension (aOR 3.37 [1.69-6.72], P=0.001), and LBW (aOR 3.61 [1.55-8.43], P=0.003) independently predicted admission to ICU. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of this model was 0.79 [95% CI, 0.74-0.85], with positive and negative predictive values of 29.1% and 97.6% respectively. Results were reproduced in an independent cohort, from a web-based survey in 1,822 subjects who self-reported laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, where 46 patients (2.5%) needed ICU admission (AUC 0.74 [95% CI 0.68-0.81]). LBW seems to be an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-elderly adults and might improve the performance of risk stratification algorithms.","Crispi, F.; Crovetto, F.; Larroya, M.; Camacho, M.; Sibila, O.; Badia, J.

2,Comorbidities and Susceptibility to COVID-19: A Generalized Gene Set Meta-Analysis Approach,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 820,000 deaths for almost 24 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of August 27th, 2020, per WHO report. Risk factors include pre-existing conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. There are currently no effective treatments. Our objective was to complete a meta-analysis to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational approach. Results SNP datasets were downloaded from publicly available GWAS catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using MAGMA program. SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. COVID-19 comorbidities from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, which were validated by Q-Q plots (p<0.05). The top 250 human mRNA gene expressions for SNP-affected pathways, extracted from publicly accessible gene expression profiles, were evaluated for significant pathways. Protein-protein interactions of identified differentially expressed genes, visualized with STRING program, were significant (p<0.05). Gene interaction networks were found to be relevant to SARS and influenza pathogenesis. Conclusion Pathways potentially affected by or affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in underlying medical conditions likely to confer susceptibility and/or severity to COVID-19.

3,A snap shot of space and time dynamics of COVID-19 risk in Malawi. An application of spatial temporal model,"Background: COVID-19 has been the greatest challenge the world has faced since the second world war. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of COVID-19 in both space and time in Malawi. Methods: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 24th June to 20th August, 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of weekly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and location as independent variables. Results: The study found significant main effect of location and time with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. Conclusion. Future or present strategies to avert the spread of COVID-19 should target major cities by limiting international exposure. In addition, the focus should be on time points that had shown high risk.","Ngwira, A.; Kumwenda, F.; Munthali, E.; Nkolokosa, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20192914v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20192914v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
4,Estimates of outbreak-specific SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological parameters from genomic data,"We estimate the basic reproductive number and case counts for 15 distinct SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, distributed across 10 countries and one cruise ship, based solely on phylodynamic analyses of genomic data. Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.","Vaughan, T.

5,The Immune-Buffer COVID-19 Exit Strategy that Protects the Elderly,"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with frequent symptoms of fever and shortness of breath. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate among elders. The virus has spread world-wide, leading to shut-down of many countries around the globe with the aim of stopping the spread of the disease. To date, there are uncertainties regarding the main factors in the disease spread, so sever social distancing measures and broad testing are required in order to protect the population at risk. With the increasing spread of the virus, there is growing fraction of the general population that may be immune to COVID-19, following infection. This immunised cohort can be uncovered via large-scale screening for the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) virus and/or its antibodies. We propose that this immune cohort be deployed as a buffer between the general population and the population most at risk from the disease. Here we show that under a broad range of realistic scenarios deploying such an immunized buffer between the general population and the population at risk may lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of deaths from the disease. This provides an impetus for: screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or its antibodies on the largest scale possible, and organizing at the family, community, national and international levels to protect vulnerable populations by deploying immunized buffers between them and the general population wherever possible.","Rom-Kedar, V.; Yaniv, O.; Malka, R.; Shapiro, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193094v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193094v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
6,Environment influences SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of non-pharmaceutical interventions,"As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to understand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modelling. We find that policy intervention (`lockdown') and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","Smith, T. P.; Flaxman, S.; Gallinat, A. S.; Kinosian, S.

7,Lack of consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials for COVID-19,"Sex and gender differences impact the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality. Furthermore, sex differences characterize the frequency and severity of pharmacological side effects. A large number of clinical trials are ongoing to develop new therapeutic approaches and vaccines for COVID-19. We investigated the inclusion of sex and/or gender in currently registered studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Only 416 (16.7%) of the 2,484 registered SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 trials mention sex/gender as recruitment criterion and only 103 (4.1%) allude to sex/gender in the description of the analysis phase. None of the 11 clinical trials published in scientific journals on June 2020 reported sex-disaggregated results. Hence, lack of consideration upon registration does not seem to be corrected during trial execution and reporting. Given the biological relevance and the potential risks of unwanted side effects, we urge researchers to focus on sex-disaggregated analyses already at the planning stage of COVID-19 trials.","Brady, E.; Nielsen, M.

8,Characterizing COVID-19 Clinical Phenotypes and Associated Comorbidities and Complication Profiles,"Background: There is limited understanding of heterogeneity in outcomes across hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. Objective: Identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of 1,022 COVID-19 patient admissions from 14 Midwest U.S. hospitals between March 7, 2020 and August 25, 2020. Methods: Ensemble clustering was performed on a set of 33 vitals and labs variables collected within 72 hours of admission. K-means based consensus clustering was used to identify three clinical phenotypes. Principal component analysis was performed on the average covariance matrix of all imputed datasets to visualize clustering and variable relationships. Multinomial regression models were fit to further compare patient comorbidities across phenotype classification. Multivariable models were fit to estimate the association between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. Main outcomes and measures: Phenotype classification (I, II, III), patient characteristics associated with phenotype assignment, in-hospital complications, and clinical outcomes including ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Results: The database included 1,022 patients requiring hospital admission with COVID-19 (median age, 62.1 [IQR: 45.9-75.8] years; 481 [48.6%] male, 412 [40.3%] required ICU admission, 437 [46.7%] were white). Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III); 236 [23.1%] patients had phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients had phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients had phenotype III. When grouping comorbidities by organ system, patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype III (p=0.002), while patients with hematologic (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and cardiac (p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly characterized by phenotype I. The adjusted odds of respiratory (p<0.001), renal (p<0.001), and metabolic (p<0.001) complications were highest for patients with phenotype I, followed by phenotype II. Patients with phenotype I had a far greater odds of hepatic (p<0.001) and hematological (p=0.02) complications than the other two phenotypes. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR: 7.30, 95% CI: (3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR: 2.57, 95% CI: (1.10-6.00), p=0.03) increases in the hazard of death, respectively, when compared to phenotype III. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19, three clinical phenotypes were identified. Future research is urgently needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical practice and trial design.","Lusczek, E. R.; Ingraham, N.

9,"Sero-surveillance (IgG) of SARS-CoV-2 among Asymptomatic General population of Paschim Medinipur District, West Bengal, India(Conducted during last week of July and 1st week of August 2020) - A Joint Venture of VRDL Lab (ICMR), Midnapore Medical College & Hospital & Department of Health and Family Welfare,Govt. of West Bengal, Paschim Medinipur","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic, and the infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has now spread to more than 200 countries . Surveillance systems form the foundation stone of active case finding, testing and contact tracing, which are the key components of the public health response to this novel, emerging infectious disease . There is uncertainty about the true proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at a given time. As per the WHO-China Joint Monitoring Mission Report, and an analysis of 21 published reports, anywhere between 5 and 80 per cent of SARS CoV 2 infected patients have been noted to be asymptomatic. Whereas in India 4197563 cases are positive, in which in West Bengal total 180788 cases (4.04% of Cases of India) positive of COVID 19. In Paschim Medinipur (West Medinipur) district contributing total 5489 cases (3.03% cases of West Bengal). In this scenario, we want to know the status of IgG seroprevalence of SARS CoV 2 among asymptomatic general population, so that we can determine the extent of infection of SARS CoV 2 in general population. Objectives: Primary Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence for SARS CoV 2 infection in the general asymptomatic population at Paschim Medinipur District. Secondary Objectives: To estimate age and sex specific seroprevalence. To determine the socio demographic risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection; To determine the other risk factors like comorbidities, vaccination status, travel history, contact history etc.; To determine the durability of Immunity (IgG) conferred by natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals previously RTPCR positive. Methodology: It was a cross sectional 30 cluster study among the population of Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal conducted in last week of July and 1st week of August 2020 among 458 asymptomatic general population and 30 RTPCR positive cases in 30 villages or wards of municipalities. 30 clusters were chosen from list of COVID 19 affected villages/wards of municipality as per PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. Results: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS CoV 2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Among risk factors, the risk of having IgG is more in persons having Travel history with odds ratio of 2.99- 95%CI (1.17-7.65) with p-value- 0.02. Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis with Odds ratio of 8.49- 95% CI(1.59-45.19) with p value - 0.003. Occupation as migrant labour with Odds ratio of 5.08- 95% CI(1.96-13.18) with p value of 0.001. H/O Chicken pox with Odds ratio of 2.15- 95% CI(0.59-7.79) with p value of 0.017. Influenza vaccinated with Odds ratio of 8.07 with 95% CI (0.8-81.48) with a p value of 0.036. Conclusion: Of the 458 asymptomatic general population,19 asymptomatic people found to be seropositive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 with Mean or average total seropositivity rate of 4.15%. 19 Out of 30 (63.33%) RTPCR positive patients found Seronegative. Median of Days between RTPCR test and sero negativity found was 60 with minimum 28 days to maximum 101 days and Range of 73 days and a standard deviation of 19.46. Those having Travel History and having occupation as Migrant Labourer have significantly higher probability of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. No role has been found of Hydroxychloroquine Medicines as Chemoprophylactic. No durable immunity conferred by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 mean time to become seronegative after positive RTPCR test 60 days. So there is a chance of reinfection after average 2 months.","Satpati, P.; Sarangi, S. S.; Gantait, K.; Endow, S.; Mandal, N.

10,Inequality in access to health and care services during lockdown - Findings from the COVID-19 survey in five UK national longitudinal studies,"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.","Topriceanu, C.-C.; Wong, A.; Moon, J.

12,Non-permissive SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural cells in the developing human brain and neurospheres,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that many other biological systems are affected, including the central nervous system (CNS). Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but its neurotropic potential is still debated. Here, we investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain from an infant patient deceased from COVID-19. The susceptibility to virus infection was compatible with the expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, which is increased in the ChP in comparison to other brain areas. To better comprehend the dynamics of the viral infection in neural cells, we exposed human neurospheres to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly to the human tissue, we found viral RNA in neurospheres, although viral particles in the culture supernatant were not infective. Based on our observations in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 does not generate productive infection in developing neural cells and that infection of ChP weakens the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier allowing viruses, immune cells, and cytokines to access the CNS, causing neural damage in the young brain.","Pedrosa, C. d.

13,Self-assembling nanoparticles presenting receptor binding domain and stabilized spike as next-generation COVID-19 vaccines,"We present a comprehensive vaccine strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by combining antigen optimization and nanoparticle display. We first developed a receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody column for purification and displayed the RBD on self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SApNPs) using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. We then identified the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) stalk as a major cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2G{Delta}HR2), and displayed S2G{Delta}HR2 on three SApNPs with high yield, purity, and antigenicity. Compared to the RBD, the RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent murine neutralizing antibody (NAb) response on par with the spike. S2G{Delta}HR2 elicited two-fold-higher NAb titers than the proline-capped spike (S2P), while S2G{Delta}HR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers. The S2G{Delta}HR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T-cell immunity, thereby providing a next-generation vaccine candidate to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.","He, L.; Lin, X.; Wang, Y.; Abraham, C.; Sou, C.; Ngo, T.; Zhang, Y.; Wilson, I.

14,Phylogenomic reveals multiple introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Peru,"Peru has become one of the countries with the highest mortality rate from the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. To investigate early transmission event and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Peru, we analyzed a total of 3472 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, from which 149 ones were from Peru to investigate how this novel virus became established in the country and to dissect the spread of the one in this area. Phylogenomic analysis revealed multiple, independent introductions of the virus mainly from Europe and Asia. In addition, we found evidence for community-driven transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different Peru regions.","Juscamayta Lopez, E.; Tarazona, D.; Valdivia Guerrero, F.; Rojas Serrano, N.; Carhuaricra, D.; Maturrano Hernandez, L.; Gavilan Chavez, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.296814v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.296814v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,False
15,Ambroxol Hydrochloride Inhibits the Interaction between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Spike Protein's Receptor Binding Domain and Recombinant Human ACE2.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters the host cells through two main pathways, both involving key interactions between viral envelope-anchored spike glycoprotein of the novel coronavirus and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected up to 26 million people worldwide; yet, there is no clinically approved drug or vaccine available. Therefore, a rapid and coordinated effort to re-purpose clinically approved drugs that prevent or disrupt these critical entry pathways of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with human ACE2, could potentially accelerate the identification and clinical advancement of prophylactic and/or treatment options against COVID-19, thus providing possible countermeasures against viral entry, pathogenesis and survival. Herein, we discovered that Ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB), and its progenitor, Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH), both clinically approved drugs are potent effective modulators of the key interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2. We also found that both compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect at micromolar concentrations. Therefore, in addition to the known TMPRSS2 activity of BHH; we report for the first time that the BHH and AMB pharmacophore has the capacity to target and modulate yet another key protein-protein interaction essential for the two known SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways into host cells. Altogether, the potent efficacy, excellent safety and pharmacologic profile of both drugs along with their affordability and availability, makes them promising candidates for drug repurposing as possible prophylactic and/or treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Olaleye, O.

17,SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein forms condensates with viral genomic RNA,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation, and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.","Jack, A.; Ferro, L.

According to the World Health Organization, about four million people die each year from mostly preventable respiratory tract infections, making it a public health concern. The official declaration of a pandemic in March 2020 due to the Sars-CoV-2 virus coincided with the influenza season in Colombia and with environmental alerts about low air quality that increase its incidence.

19,Genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein,"Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, NSP1, for shutting down host translation. Despite this, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing NSP1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes preferentially translated in the context of NSP1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we also uncover potential mechanisms of preferential translation through the presence of shared sites for specific RNA binding proteins and a remarkable enrichment for 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine tracts. Collectively, the present study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by NSP1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","Rao, S.; Hoskins, I.; Garcia, D.; Tonn, T.; Ozadam, H.; Sarinay Cenik, E.; Cenik, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.295493v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.295493v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,False
20,Differences in innate Intracellular viral suppression competencies may explain variations in morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ravage the world with wide variations in morbidity and mortality that have remained largely unexplained, even by mutations in protein coding regions. In this study, we analyzed available complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences using the CpG index as a signature of Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) activity to examine population variations in innate intracellular antiviral competencies. The result suggests that differential ZAP activity may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Africa, Asia, and pools of asymptomatic patients had I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity, while SARS-CoV-2 sequences from North America and Intensive Care Unit or Deceased patients had I_CpG signature of low ZAP activity. ZAP activity is linked to the interferon system. Low ZAP activity may be part of the explanation for the increased morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly and with comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. It may also provide some insight into the discrepancies between invitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of candidate therapies and performance in clinical trials. Furthermore, our results suggest that asymptomatic patients may paradoxically shed a more dangerous virus.","Bello, S. O.; Igumbor, E.; Deeni, Y. Y.; Ochu, C. L.; Popoola, M.

21,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS admitted to a third level health institution in Mexico City,"Abstract Background: In December 2019, the first cases of severe pneumonia associated with a new coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China. Severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care was reported in up to 5% of cases. There is, however, limited information available in Mexico. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a COVID-19 cohort attended to from March to May 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we explored the association of clinical variables with mortality. Methods: The first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020, to Jun 24, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The survival endpoint was mortality at discharge from the RICU. Results: Data from 68 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and 30 died (mortality: 44.1 %). Of the 16 predictive variables analyzed, only 6 remained significant in the multivariate analysis [OR (95% confidence interval)]: no acute kidney injury (AKI)/AKI 1: [.61 (.001;.192)]; delta lymphocyte count: [.061 (.006;.619)]; delta ventilatory ratio: [8.19 (1.40;47.8)]; norepinephrine support at admission: [34.3 (2.1;550)]; body mass index: [1.41 (1.09;1.83)]; and bacterial coinfection: [18.5 (1.4;232)].

Using an ELISA-based approach to that combines data about IgG responses to both the Nucleocapsid and Spike-receptor binding domain antigens, we show that near-optimal sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. We used this assay to assess the frequency of virus-specific antibodies in a cohort of elective surgery patients in Australia and estimated seroprevalence in Australia to be 0.28% (0 to 0.72%).

23,Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation,"Masks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~50%. Slight increases in masking relative to current levels would reduce the reproductive number substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks that reduce transmission risk by 50% will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who do get infected, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy is only effective for this indication as post-exposure prophylaxis, specifically if given to ~50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.","Goyal, A.; Reeves, D.

Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are difficult to implement in settings with limited resources necessitating the development of accurate alternative testing strategies that perform robustly. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleotide sequences and identifying nucleobase identity without the requirement of trans-cleavage activity of reporter molecules. We demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including heterozygous carriers of a mutation and present a simple design strategy in the form of a web-tool, JATAYU, for its implementation. FELUDA is semi quantitative, can be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed and deployed for versatile applications such as infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Using a lateral flow readout within 1h, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all range of viral loads in clinical samples.

26,Genome sequencing of sewage detects regionally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants,"Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the US or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside of CA, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing.

In this research, we report sensing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus in seconds via an electrochemical platform consisting of gold micropillar array electrodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide and functionalized with recombinant viral antigens. The array electrodes are fabricated by Aerosol Jet (AJ) nanoparticle 3D printing, where gold nanoparticles (3-5nm) are assembled in 3D space, sintered, and integrated with a microfluidic device. The device is shown to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and its receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at concentrations down to 1pM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and read by a smartphone-based user interface. In addition, the sensor can be regenerated within a minute by introducing a low-pH chemistry that elutes the antibodies from the antigens, allowing successive testing of multiple antibody samples using the same sensor. The detection time for the two antibodies tested in this work is 11.5 seconds. S1 protein sensing of its antibodies is specific, which cross-reacts neither with other antibodies nor with proteins such as Nucleocapsid antibody and Interleukin-6 protein. The proposed sensing platform is generic and can also be used for the rapid detection of biomarkers for other infectious agents such as Ebola, HIV, and Zika, which will benefit the public health.","Ali, M.

A primary aim for utilization of serological tests are to better quantify the number of COVID-19 cases including those RT-PCR samples were negative but showing clinical and radiological signs of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to report the features of the patients that were diagnosed and treated as possible COVID-19 cases whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab samples were negative by RT-PCR but serological IgM/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by rapid antibody test. Method: We retrospectively analyzed eighty suspected COVID-19 cases that have at least two negative consecutive COVID-19 PCR test and were subjected to serological rapid antibody test. Result: The specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as positive in twenty-two patients. The mean age of patient group was 63.2+-13.1 years old with male /female ratio 11/11. Cough was the most common symptom with 90.9%. Most common presenting chest CT findings were bilateral ground glass opacities (77.2%) and alveolar consolidations (50.09%).

Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on an online survey, collected demographic data and mental distress outcomes from 184 HCWs from May 1st, 2020, to June,15th, 2020, from 45 different countries. The degree of secondary traumatization was assessed using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), the degrees of perceived stress and burnout were assessed with Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk and protective factors for STS. Results: 184 HCWs (M=90; Age mean: 46.45; SD:11.02) completed the survey. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (41.3%), emotional exhaustion (56.0%), and depersonalization (48.9%). The prevalence of secondary traumatic stress in frontline HCWs was 47.5% while in HCWs working in other units it was 30.3% (p<.023); additionally, the prevalence of the same outcome was 67.1% for the HCWs exposed to patients' death and 32.9% for those HCWs which were not exposed to the same condition (p<.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and exposure to patients' death remained as significant predictors in the final model for secondary traumatic stress (adjusted R2 =0.537, p<0.001). Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs facing patients' physical pain, psychological suffering, and death are more likely to develop secondary traumatization.","Marzetti, F.; Vagheggini, G.; Conversano, C.; Miccoli, M.; Gemignani, A.; Ciacchini, R.; Panait, E.; Orru, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20186692v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20186692v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
30,Role of Weather Factors in COVID-19 Deaths in Tropical Climate: A Data-Driven Study Focused on Brazil,"Background: Brazil reported 123,780 deaths across 27 administrative regions, making it the second-worst affected country after the US in terms of COVID-19 deaths as of 3 September 2020. Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. Methods: We use a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 27 administrative regions in Brazil across 182 days (n=3882) and analyze the role of relevant weather factors by using daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil as the dependent variable. We carry out robustness checks using case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable. Findings: We control for all time-fixed and various time-varying region-specific factors confounding factors. We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in Brazil with weather factors - UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover. Specifically, a unit increase in UVI, maximum temperature, and ozone independently associate with 6.0 percentage points [p<0.001], 1.8 percentage points [p<0.01] and 0.3 percentage points [p<0. 1] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Further, a unit percentage increase in cloud cover associates with a decline of 0.148 percentage points [p<0.05] in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the CFR as the dependent variable. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover in mitigating COVID-19 deaths, even in a tropical country like Brazil. We observe these results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust. These results could guide health-related policy decision making in Brazil as well as similar tropical countries.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193532v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193532v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True
31,Quantifying heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the lockdown in India,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shows marked heterogeneity in its transmission. Here, we used data collected from contact tracing during the lockdown in Punjab, a major state in India, to quantify this heterogeneity, and to examine implications for transmission dynamics. We found evidence of heterogeneity acting at multiple levels: in the number of potentially infectious contacts per index case, and in the per-contact risk of infection. Incorporating these findings in simple mathematical models of disease transmission reveals that these heterogeneities act in combination to strongly influence transmission dynamics. Standard approaches, such as representing heterogeneity through secondary case distributions, could be biased by neglecting these underlying interactions between heterogeneities. We discuss implications for policy, and for more efficient contact tracing in resource-constrained settings such as India. Our results highlight how contact tracing, an important public health measure, can also provide important insights into epidemic spread and control.","Arinaminpathy, N.; Das, J.; McCormick, T.; Mukhopadhyay, P.; Sircar, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20190017v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20190017v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

33,"The impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19: a geospatial, agent based epidemiology model","Background: Natural disasters and infectious diseases are global issues, resulting in widespread disruption to human health and livelihood. At the scale of a global pandemic, the co-occurrence of natural disasters is inevitable. However, the impact of natural disasters on the spread of COVID-19 has not been extensively evaluated using agent based epidemiology models. Methods: We create an agent-based epidemiology model based on both COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological data and geographic data. We first model 35 scenarios with varying natural disaster timing and duration for a COVID-19 outbreak in a theoretical region. We then evaluate the potential effect of an eruption of Vesuvius volcano on the spread of COVID-19 in Campania, Italy. Our objective is to determine if the occurrence of a natural disaster during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase infection cases and disease related fatalities. Results: In a majority of cases, the occurrence of a natural disaster increases the number of disease related fatalities. When the natural disaster occurs at the beginning of the outbreak within a given region, there is little to no increase in the progression of disease spread. However, the occurrence of a natural disaster close to the peak of infections may increase the number of fatalities by more than five-fold. In a theoretical test case, for a natural disaster that occurred fifty days after first infection case, the median increase in fatalities is 2%, 59%, and 180% for a 2, 14, and 31-day long natural disaster respectively, when compared to the no natural disaster scenario. Conclusion: We propose that the compound risk from natural disasters is greatest in the case of already widespread disease outbreak. The key risk factors for increase in spread of infection and disease related fatalities are the timing of the natural disaster relative to the peak in infections and the duration of the natural disaster.","Van Wyk de Vries, M.

34,The impact of digital contact tracing on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - a comprehensive modelling study,"Contact tracing is one of several strategies employed in many countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions (R0 at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where O(0.1%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.","Pollmann, T.

35,Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with Personality Disorders: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to May 2020,"The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a widespread impact on mental healthcare for both services themselves and the people accessing those services. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to understand this further for specific groups, including those diagnosed with a personality disorder who might have particular vulnerabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with personality disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st May 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with personality disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with personality disorder over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. Liaison and Older Adult teams showed the largest drop in caseloads, whereas Early Intervention in Psychosis service caseloads remained the same. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was a 28% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March.","Nuzum, E.; Martin, E.; Broadbent, M.; Stewart, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193730v1?rss=1,2020-09-14,2020-09-14,,True

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged children.","Goldfarb, D. M.; Tilley, P.; Al-Rawahi, G.

37,Seroprevalence and Correlates of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Healthcare Workers in Chicago,"Background: Identifying factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW)s may help health systems optimize SARS-CoV-2 infection control strategies. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study. The Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay was used to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to COVID-19) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, healthcare delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. Results: 6,510 HCWs, including 1,794 nurses, and 904 non-patient facing administrators participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were white, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic and 3.1% were Black. The crude prevalence rate of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6%-5.2%). Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs and was strongly associated with seropositivity (OR=4.7, 95% CI: 3.5-6.4). When compared to administrators, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher adjusted-odds (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to COVID-19 patients was reported by 37.8% of participants and was associated with higher positivity than those not exposed (OR= 2.2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.0). Being exposed to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy, and hemodialysis also remained significantly associated with a 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively. Conclusions: Exposure to COVID-19 patients, and longer duration patient therapies were each associated with higher risk for seropositive status; however, the community burden of COVID-19 remains a significant source of exposure to SARS CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Chicago.","Wilkins, J.; Gray, E.

38,RAAS blockers and region-specific variations in COVID-19 outcomes: findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved as a global crisis with high mortality seen in elderly and people with cardiometabolic diseases. The use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in these patients is known to enhance the expression of ACE-2, the chief binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and may potentially enhance infectivity. Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blocker usage on COVID-19 outcomes. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest. The last search was conducted on 9th July 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting data on RAAS blocker use and COVID-19 mortality and severity were included in the review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Mortality data and severity data including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, steroid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) were recorded. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) estimates were reported with 95% CIs and level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of mortality in users of RAAS blockers with respect to non-users was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, steroid use, and AKI in users with respect to non-users of RAAS blockers were the secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1348 articles identified, 48 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26432 patients from 31 studies included in mortality analysis and 20127 patients from 23 studies included in severity analysis. Majority of the studies (41.6%) were from China. No increased risk of mortality (Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65-1.26), I2=89%) or severity (Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79-1.46), I2=88%) was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension (pooled OR 0.63 (0.46-0.86), I2=58%). Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was found to be high for Europeans (Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52-2.85), I2=77%) and US patients (Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62-2.17) in users of RAAS-blockers. A nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization, two times higher risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was observed in US patients on RAAS blockers. No net effect on mortality and severity outcomes was seen in Chinese patients. RAAS blocker usage did not have any effect on corticosteroid use and AKI in Chinese patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of RAAS blockers is not associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Reduced mortality is seen in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and therefore the drugs should be continued in this subset. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenomic differences may explain the ethnicity related variations.","Kaur, U.; Chakrabarti, S. S.; Patel, T.

40,Age-dependent regulation of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes and cell death programs correlates with COVID-19 disease severity,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) maintains cardiovascular and renal homeostasis but also serves as the entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from [~]4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells - this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.","Inde, Z.; Yapp, C.; Joshi, G.

43,Evaluation of stability and inactivation methods of SARS-CoV-2 in context of laboratory settings,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the acute respiratory disease COVID-19, which has become a global concern due to its rapid spread. Laboratory work with SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting was rated to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. However, certain research applications in particular in molecular biology require incomplete denaturation of the proteins, which might cause safety issues handling contaminated samples. In particular, it is critical to provide proof of inactivation before samples can be removed from the BSL-3.

In this study, we evaluated common lysis buffers that are used in molecular biological laboratories for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. We have found that guanidine thiocyanate, SDS, and Triton-X containing lysis buffers were effective in inactivation of SARS-CoV-2, however, the M-PER lysis buffer containing a proprietary detergent failed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

Furthermore, we compared chemical and non-chemical inactivation methods including ethanol, acetone-methanol mixture, PFA, UV-C light, and heat inactivation. In addition, the stability of the virus in cell culture media at 4{degrees}C and on surfaces used in laboratory environment was analyzed.

The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were [&ge;]18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 18 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 72% and 61% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)], fever [1.066 (1.014 - 1.121)] and be 50 to 69 years old [1.094 (1.021 - 1.172)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [1.068 (1.019 - 1.119)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.849 (0.765 - 0.943)] and heart failure history [0.093 (0.891 - 0.978)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough, fever and being 50 to 69 years old are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization. Despite published studies reporting a high prevalence of lymphopenia among COVID-19 positive patients, lymphopenia is not associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19.

46,Development of a serological assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While molecular assays are used to detect viral genetic material for the diagnosis of acute infection, reliable serological assays are needed to measure immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: the full-length spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Our assay is sensitive and specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM anti-S protein and anti-RBD antibodies. Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This method provides a high-throughput assay that does not require specialized instrumentation and can be widely used to determine immunity and the dynamic range of antibodies found within SARS-CoV-2.","Huynh, A.; Arnold, D.

47,Anakinra and Intravenous IgG versus Tocilizumab in the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory failure and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects. The choice of treatment does not appear to affect morbidity or mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our study findings.

49,Clinical effectiveness of drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective. The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Method. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization), virological clearance, and severe adverse events. Results. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Ten articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. Conclusions. Dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. Significance of results. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries; since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.

50,Temporal Analysis of COVID-19 Peak Outbreak,"Intent of this research is to explore how a specific class of mathematical models namely Susceptible-Infected-Removed model can be utilized to forecast peak outbreak timelines of COVID-19 epidemic amongst a population of interest starting from the date of first reported case. Till the time of this research, there was no effective and universally accepted vaccine to control transmission and spread of this infection. COVID-19 primarily spreads in population through respiratory droplets from an infected person cough and sneeze which infects people who are in proximity. COVID-19 is spreading contagiously across the world. If health policy makers and medical experts could get early and timely insights into when peak infection rate would occur after first reported case, they could plan and optimize medical personnel, ventilators supply, and other medical resources without over-taxing the infrastructure. The predictions may also help policymakers devise strategies to control the epidemic, potentially saving many lives. Thus, it can aid in critical decision-making process by providing actionable insights into COVID-19 outbreak by leveraging available data.","Tewari, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192229v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192229v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
51,SARS2 simplified scores to estimate risk of hospitalization and death among patients with COVID-19,"Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 based on the medical history of patients, simplified risk prediction models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.","Dashti, H.; Roche, E.; Bates, D.; Mora, S.; Demler, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20190520v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20190520v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
52,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Associated with SARS-CoV-2; a Multinational Case Series,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 induced coagulopathy can lead to thrombotic complications such as stroke. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[&le;]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","Mowla, A.; Shakibajahromi, B.; Shahjouei, S.; Borhani-Haghighi, A.; Rahimian, N.; Baharvahdat, H.; Naderi, S.; Khorvash, F.; Altafi, D.; Ebrahimzadeh, S.

53,Ignoring the elephant in the room: factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in South Africa.,"Background: Evidence have shown that the prescribed lockdown and social distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made accessing essential health care much more difficult in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggests strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic. Moreover, special consideration should be given to certain provinces and those in 3rd quintile of wealth income.","Bolarinwa, O.

54,Adapting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling to accommodate imperfect tests: application to COVID-19 serosurveillance in Haiti,"Background: Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), a tool used for monitoring health indicators in low resource settings resulting in ""high"" or ""low"" classifications, assumes that determination of the trait of interest is perfect. This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.","Fulcher, I.

55,"Ventilation and the SARS-CoV-2 CoronavirusAnalysis of outbreaks in a restaurant and on a bus in China,and at a Call Center in South Korea","In a previous paper [10] a model of the distribution of respiratory droplets and aerosols by Lagrangian turbulent air-flow was developed. It is used to show how the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus can be spread by the breathing of single infected person. The model shows that the concentration of viruses in the cloud, exhaled by one person, can increase to infectious levels within a certain amount of time, in a confined space where the air re-circulates. In [10] the model was used to analyze the air-flow and SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus build-up in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China [19,18]. In this paper, we add the analysis of two more cases, an outbreak among lay-Buddhists, on a bus [26], traveling to a ceremony in Zhejiang province, China, and an outbreak in a Call Center in Seoul, Korea [20]. The analysis and comparison of these three cases, leads to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus attacks in two steps: The first step is a linear spread between individuals with a couple of days delay. The second step is an exponential spread effected by the air-conditioning system affecting a much larger number of people. Thus in the second step, the ventilation becomes the super-spreader.","Birnir, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192997v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192997v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
56,Serological evidence of human infection with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported worldwide. A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN and Wellcome were searched for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Study selection: Serological studies that evaluated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Data Synthesis: Most of 178 serological studies, representing tests in >800,000 individuals, identified were of low quality. Close contacts and high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 22.9% (95% CI: 11.1-34.7%) and 14.9% (4.8-25.0%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.5% (4.6-6.4%) and 6.3% (5.5-7.1%). Generally, young people (0-20 yrs) were less likely to be seropositive compared to the middle-aged (21-55 yrs) populations (RR, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-0.8). Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports with 10 (range: 2 to 34) infections per confirmed COVID-19 case. Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively. Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given that ratio of infections to confirmed cases is on the same order of magnitude across different locales, reported case numbers may help provide insights into the proportion of the population infected.

57,Mask-Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background Masks have been widely recommended as a precaution against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","Aravindakshan, A.; Boehnke, J.; Gholami, E.; Nayak, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
58,Automatic Contact Tracing for Outbreak Detection UsingHospital Electronic Medical Record Data,"Contact tracing is a well-known tool for public health professionals to trace and isolate contacts of known infectious persons. During a pandemic contact tracing is critical to ending an outbreak, but the volume of cases makes tracing difficult without adequate staffing tools. Hospitals equipped with electronic medical records can utilize these databases to automatically link cases into possible transmission chains and surface potential new outbreaks. While this automatic contact tracing does not have the richness of contact tracing interviews, it does provide a way for health systems to highlight potential super-spreader events and support their local health departments. Additionally, these data provide insight into how a given infection is spreading locally. These insights can be used to inform policy at the local level.","DeWitt, M.

59,The Effect of Early Hydroxychloroquine-based Therapy in COVID-19 Patients in Ambulatory Care Settings: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven effective therapy nor vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.","Sulaiman, T.; Mohana, A.; Alawdah, L.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Wani, T.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; AlKhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; AlAnazi, M.; Alqahtani, M.; Abdalla, K.; Yousif, Y.; AboGazalah, F.; Awwad, F.; AlabdulKareem, K.; AlGhofaili, F.; AlJedai, A.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
60,"Impact and Correlation of Air Quality and Climate Variables with COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality in Dhaka, Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly stopped the steady life and enhanced environmental quality. To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 with STD of 37.9 and 87.1 with STD of 52.8 microgram m-3, and 427 with STD of 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 micromol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 micromol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.","Salam, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193086v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193086v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
61,On Machine Learning-Based Short-Term Adjustment of Epidemiological Projections of COVID-19 in US,"Epidemiological models have provided valuable information for the outlook of COVID-19 pandemic and relative impact of different mitigation scenarios. However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.","KEFAYATI, S.; Huang, H.; Chakraborty, P.; Roberts, F.; Gopalakrishnan, V.; Srinivasan, R.; Pethe, S.; Madan, P.; Deshpande, A.; Liu, X.; Hu, J.; Jackson, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
62,Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19.","Gao, D.; Li, F.; Han, M.; Dai, P.; Xu, W.; He, J.; Tao, X.; Wu, Y.; Tong, X.; Xia, X.; Guo, W.; Li, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Zhang, X.; Liu, Z.; Aji, R.; Cai, X.; Li, Y.; Qu, D.; Chen, Y.; Jiang, S.; Wang, Q.; Ji, H.; Xie, Y.; Sun, Y.; Lu, L.; Zhou, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293035v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293035v1?rss=1,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
63,Immunologically distinct responses occur in the CNS of COVID-19 patients,"A subset of patients with COVID-19 display neurologic symptoms but it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 damages the central nervous system (CNS) directly through neuroinvasion, or if neurological symptoms are due to secondary mechanisms, including immune-mediated effects. Here, we examined the immune milieu in the CNS through the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in circulation through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Single cell sequencing with paired repertoire sequencing of PBMCs and CSF cells show evidence for unique immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Strikingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in the CSF of all patients studied, but the antibody epitope specificity in the CSF and relative prevalence of B cell receptor sequences markedly differed when compared to those found in paired serum. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that localized CNS immune responses occur following viral neuroinvasion, and that the CSF is a faithful surrogate for responses occurring uniquely in the CNS. These results illuminate CNS compartment-specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, forming the basis for informed treatment of neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Song, E.; Chow, R.

64,Inferring MHC interacting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes recognized by TCRs towards designing T cell-based vaccines,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome mediated by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and was declared by WHO as a major international public health concern. While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mohseni, A.

65,A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored noninfectious replicon of SARS-CoV-2,"Vaccines and antiviral agents are in urgent need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.","Zhang, Y.; Song, W.; Chen, S.; Yuan, Z.; Yi, Z.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.294330v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.294330v1?rss=1,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
66,Daytime variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production,"S. Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.

ImportanceThe implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated. The time of day of infection is critical for illness progression as reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. In this study, we wondered if SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production by human monocytes, innate immune cells affected by Covid-19, were regulated by CR. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.","Diallo, A.

67,Type I Interferon Limits Viral Dissemination-Driven Clinical Heterogeneity in a Native Murine Betacoronavirus Model of COVID-19,"Emerging clinical data demonstrates that COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, is a syndrome that variably affects nearly every organ system. Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.","Qing, H.; Sharma, L.; Hilliard, B.

68,Ketogenesis restrains aging-induced exacerbation of COVID in a mouse model,"Increasing age is the strongest predictor of risk of COVID-19 severity. Unregulated cytokine storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of {gamma}{delta} T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective {gamma}{delta} T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly.

Highlights - Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.
- Aged infected mice have systemic inflammation and inflammasome activation
- Murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection results in loss of pulmonary {gamma}{delta} T cells.
- Ketones protect aged mice from infection by reducing inflammation.

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. We showed that the decoration of S494 with core and elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2 interface with more favorable binding free energies for longer oligosaccharides. Hence, the further drug design attempts should take this crucial factor into account, while suggesting any novel therapeutic candidate.","Rahnama, S.; Azimzadeh Irani, M.; Amininasab, M.; Ejtehadi, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.294504v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.294504v1?rss=1,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
70,Functional interrogation of a SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome identifies unique and shared coronavirus host factors,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed nearly one million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 {degrees}C and 37 {degrees}C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating COVID-19, and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.

HIGHLIGHTSFocused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses.

Focused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genome-wide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter.

Parallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.

The number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the number of functional interactors.

71,"Molecular Characterization, Phylogenetic and Variation Analyzes of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Turkey","IntroductionWe present the sequence analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

MethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.

ResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.

ConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.","Karamese, M.; Ozgur, D.; Tutuncu, E.

72,Identifying zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between Spike receptor-binding domain and host ACE2,"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","Huang, X.; Zhang, C.; Pearce, R.; Omenn, G.

73,A COVID-19 antibody curbs SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-induced complement hyper-activation,"Although human antibodies elicited by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein are profoundly boosted upon infection, little is known about the function of N-directed antibodies. Herein, we isolated and profiled a panel of 32 N protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from a quick recovery coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) convalescent, who had dominant antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 N protein rather than to Spike protein. The complex structure of N protein RNA binding domain with the highest binding affinity mAb nCoV396 reveals the epitopes and antigens allosteric changes. Functionally, a virus-free complement hyper-activation analysis demonstrates that nCoV396 specifically compromises N protein-induced complement hyper-activation, a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, thus paving the way for functional anti-N mAbs identification.

74,A key linear epitope for a potent neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 confers a serious threat to the public health without effective intervention strategies1-3. Its variant carrying mutated Spike (S) protein D614G (SD614G) has become the most prevalent form in the current global pandemic4,5. We have identified a large panel of potential neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S6. Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. This study paves the way for the applications of these NAbs and the potential safe and effective vaccine design.","Li, T.; Han, X.; Wang, Y.; Gu, C.; Wang, J.; Hu, C.; Li, S.; Wang, K.; Luo, F.; Huang, J.; Long, Y.; Song, S.; Wang, W.; Hu, J.; Wu, R.; Mu, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, Q.; Gao, F.; Shen, M.; Long, S.; Gong, F.; Li, L.; Wu, Y.; Xu, W.; Cai, X.; Qu, D.; Yuan, Z.; Gao, Q.; Zhang, G.; He, C.; Nai, Y.; Deng, K.; Du, L.; Tang, N.; Xie, Y.; Huang, A.; Jin, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.292631v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.292631v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,False
75,A comparative survey of betacoronavirus strain molecular dynamics identifies key ACE2 binding sites,"Comparative functional analysis of the binding interactions between various betacoronavirus strains and their potential human target proteins, such as ACE1, ACE2 and CD26, is critical to our future understanding and combating of COVID-19. Here, employing large replicate sets of GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom fluctuations of the known human target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. We identify a common interaction site between the N-terminal helices of ACE2 and the viral RBD in all strains (hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV-2) and a second more dynamically complex RBD interaction site involving the ACE2 amino acid sites K353, Q325, and a novel motif, AAQPFLL (386-392) in the more recent cross-species spillovers (i.e. absent in hCoV-OC43). We use computational mutagenesis to further confirm the functional relevance of these sites. We propose a ""one touch/two touch"" model of viral evolution potentially involved in functionally facilitating binding interactions in zoonotic spillovers. We also observe these two touch sites governing RBD binding activity in simulations on hybrid models of the suspected viral progenitor, batCoV-HKU4, interacting with both the human SARS target, ACE2, and the human MERS target, CD26. Lastly, we confirm that the presence of a common hypertension drug (lisinopril) within the target site of SARS-CoV-2 bound models of ACE1 and ACE2 acts to enhance the RBD interactions at the same key sites in our proposed model. In the near future, we recommend that our comparative computational analysis identifying these key viral RBD-ACE2 binding interactions be supplemented with comparative studies of site-directed mutagenesis in order to screen for current and future coronavirus strains at high risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe generated structural models of the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain from recent and past betacoronavirus outbreak strains aligned to the angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 protein, the primary target protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID 19. We then statistically compared computer simulated molecular dynamics of viral bound and unbound versions of each model to identify locations where interactions with each viral strain have dampened the atom fluctuations during viral binding. We demonstrate that all known strains of betacoronavirus are strongly interactive with the N-terminal helix region of ACE2. We also identify a more complex viral interaction with three novel sites that associates with more recent and deadly SARS strains, and also a bat progenitor strain HKU4.","Rynkiewicz, P.

76,In silico prediction of COVID-19 test efficiency with DinoKnot,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus spreading across the world causing the disease COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA/RNA) of similar or different type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the primer/probe binding region may affect the primer/probe ability and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Author summaryThe current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection. We discuss the limitations of the current COVID-19 testing and suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test that can be aided by our findings.","Newman, T.; Chang, H. F.

Several studies give primary indication of the possible role of preexisting immunity whether cross immunity or not. Possible role of latent TB and BCG have been already suggested to create innate cross heterogeneous immunity. Possible role of malaria is suggested in this paper possibly by same mechanism of protection. Material and methods:80 malarious countries are enrolled in this study. Hierarchical multiple regression type of analyses is used for data analyses. TB prevalence/ 100,000 population standardized to BCG coverage rates is taken as direct factor in the test. Malaria incidence /1000 population is considered as intermediate factor and the outcome is COVID-19 mortality/ 1 million (M) population. Results: The results show with robust statistical support that standerized TB prevalence to BCG coverage is significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality and malaria incidence have an additional highly significant effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions: Malaria and standardized TB prevalence are statistical significant factors predicting COVID-19 mortality in negative associations.","Raham, T.

78,SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 C-terminal region (residues 130-180) is an intrinsically disordered region,"Nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in downregulation of RIG-I pathways and interacts with 40 S ribosome. Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","Kumar, A.; Kumar, A.; Kumar, P.; Garg, N.; Giri, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.290932v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.290932v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,False
79,Conserved interactions required for in vitro inhibition of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires a fast development of antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50M concentration range.

80,Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain that escape antibody recognition,"Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and make a major contribution to the neutralizing antibody response elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding, and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","Greaney, A. J.; Starr, T.

The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to better determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Pickering, B.; Smith, G.; Pinette, M.; Embury-Hyatt, C.; Moffat, E.; Marszal, P.; Lewis, C.

83,Inhibitor binding influences the protonation states of histidines in SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","Pavlova, A.; Lynch, D.

84,Molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 spike affinity for human ACE2 receptor,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantially more infections, deaths, and economic disruptions than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","Delgado, J.

85,Epigenetic Evolution of ACE2 and IL-6 Genes as Non-Canonical Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlate to COVID-19 Susceptibility in Vertebrates,"Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally within a matter of months. The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","Sang, E.

Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a key antigen that is targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings provided molecular explanations for the observation that individuals with certain HLA alleles such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

87,COVID-19 Biomarkers in research: Extension of the OncoMX cancer biomarker data model to capture biomarker data from other diseases.,"Scientists, medical researchers, and health care workers have mobilized worldwide in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; SCoV2). Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-{propto}, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology.

In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences of convalescent plasma and antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and conformations for immunogen design.","Lu, M.; Uchil, P. D.; Li, W.; Zheng, D.; Terry, D.

89,Transcriptomic dysregulations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human nasopharyngeal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"IntroductionOver 24 million people have been infected globally with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, with more than 820,000 succumbing to the resulting COVID-19 disease as of the end of August 2020. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.

MethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.

ResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups.

ConclusionOur results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

90,Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization by Secretory IgA in vitro,"SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of the illness. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 individuals. IgA responses in plasma generally correlate with IgG responses and clones of IgM, IgG and IgA producing B cells that are derived from common progenitors are evident. Plasma IgA monomers are 2-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form in the nasopharynx, are on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers. Thus, secretory IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.","Wang, Z.; Lorenzi, J. C.

91,Small molecules inhibit SARS-COV-2 induced aberrant inflammation and viral replication in mice by targeting S100A8/A9-TLR4 axis,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Guo, Q.; Zhao, Y.; Li, J.; Liu, J.; Qin, C.; Wang, X.; You, F.; Guo, X.; Zhang, Z.; Cao, L.; Luo, Y.; Wang, X.; Wei, X.; Chen, L.; Bao, L.; Deng, W.; Zhu, H.; Gao, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False

Research to identify effective therapies for COVID19 includes: i) designing a vaccine as future protection; ii) structure-based drug design; and iii) identifying existing drugs to repurpose them as effective and immediate treatments. To assist in drug repurposing and design, we determined two apo structures of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 main protease at ambienttemperature by Serial Femtosecond X-ray crystallography. We employed detailed molecular simulations of selected known main protease inhibitors with the structures and compared binding modes and energies. The combined structural biology and molecular modeling studies not only reveal the dynamics of small molecules targeting main protease but will also provide invaluable opportunities for drug repurposing and structure-based drug design studies against SARS-CoV-2.

93,Interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 with host receptome through spike protein,"Host cellular receptors are key determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.","Lu, Z.; Gu, Y.; Cao, J.; Zhang, X.; Gao, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhang, J.; Shen, G.; Jiang, X.; Yang, J.; Zheng, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, C.

Product development and manufacturing were carried out in a BSL-3 facility. Immunogenicity was determined at two antigen concentrations (3g and 6g), with two different adjuvants, in mice, rats, and rabbits. Our results show that BBV152 vaccine formulations generated significantly high antigen-binding and neutralizing antibody titers, at both concentrations, in all three species with excellent safety profiles.

Here, we examined the manifestations of the COVID-19 outbreak on the brain structure in the healthy population, following the initial phase of the pandemic in Israel. We pre-registered our hypothesis that the intense experience of the outbreak potentially induced stress-related brain modifications5-8. Volumetric changes in n = 50 participants scanned before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, were compared with n = 50 control participants that were scanned twice prior to the pandemic. The pandemic provided a rare opportunity to examine brain plasticity in a natural experiment. We found volumetric increases in bilateral amygdalae, putamen, and the anterior temporal cortices. Changes in the amygdalae diminished as time elapsed from lockdown relief, suggesting that the intense experience associated with the pandemic outbreak induced volumetric changes in brain regions commonly associated with stress and anxiety9-11.","Salomon, T.; Cohem, A.; Ben-Zvi, G.; Gera, R.; Oren, S.; Roll, D.; Rozic, G.; Saliy, A.; Tik, N.; Tsarfati, G.; Tavor, I.; Schonberg, T.; Assaf, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.285007v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.285007v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False
96,"Rapid, high-yield production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain by transient gene expression in CHO cells","Recombinant forms of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses have proven difficult to produce with good yields in mammalian cells. Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","Stuible, M.; Gervais, C.; Lord-Dufour, S.; Perret, S.; L'Abbe, D.; Schrag, J.; St-Laurent, G.; Durocher, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False
97,Structural Genetics of circulating variants affecting the SARS CoV-2 Spike / human ACE2 complex,"SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral Spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these results with the current mutational status of these amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 10 distinct patients: N439K, G476S, S477N and N501Y. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.

Significance StatementWe developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","Ortuso, F.; Mercatelli, D.; Guzzi, P.

We apply these models to public TCR data and show how they can be used to study T-cell longitudinal profiles in COVID-19 patients to characterize how the adaptive immune system reacts to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our findings confirm prior knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cell diversity increases over the course of disease progression. However our results show a difference between those T cells that react to epitope unique to SARS-CoV-2, which show a more prominent increase, and those T cells that react to epitopes common to other coronaviruses, which begin at a higher baseline.","Meysman, P.; Postovskaya, A.; De Neuter, N.; Ogunjimi, B.; Laukens, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289355v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289355v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False

Methods2906 persons >18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test.

ResultsAge- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age 30-69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies.
