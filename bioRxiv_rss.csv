0,"Acquired decrease of the C3b/C4b Receptor (CR1, CD35) and C4d deposits on Erythrocytes from ICU COVID-19 Patients","We determined CR1, CD35 the C3b, C4b receptor density, C3b/C3bi and C4d deposits densities on Erythrocytes (E) in 51 COVID-19 patients undergoing O2 therapy or assisted ventilation in ICU units in Rheims France. A clear acquired decrease of CR1 density of E from COVID-19 patients was observed, particularly among fatal cases, and paralleling several severity parameters. Deposits of C4d largely above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without C3 deposits, have been observed in more than 80% of the patients, reminiscent of the sub endothelial pericapil-lary deposits in organ transplant rejection, already observed on E in parallel, as well as also observed on E in clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits were only observed among 1/4 of the patients. The decrease of CR1/E density, and the detection of virus spike, C3 or C4 fragment on E, among COVID-19 pa-tients, are likely to be two aspects of the same phenomenon of immune complexes or complement fragment coated cell debris handling and clearance. Measurement of C4d deposit on E might represent a way for assessing inflammation and comple-ment activation occurring in organ capillaries. CR1/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings stress on the participation of the complement regulatory pro-teins in that disease and evidence that E matter in immune mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. The use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules with the aim of down regulating complement activation and inflammation for therapy should also be considered.","KISSERLI, A.; SCHNEIDER, N.; AUDONNET, S.; TABARY, T.; GOURY, A.; COUSSON, J.; MAHMOUDI, R.; BANI-SADR, F.; KANAGARATNAM, L.; JOLLY, D.; COHEN, J.

1,Protecting healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Australian results from the PPE-SAFE survey.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Healthcare workers (HCW) have comprised a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases in many countries. The PPE-SAFE survey was conducted to study current practices, availability, shortages, training and confidence in PPE amongst intensive care HCWs around the world. Herein, we describe the results of the Australian respondents to the PPE-SAFE survey. 29% of respondents reported that at least one item of usually available PPE was missing, and 12% reported reuse of single-use items. Only 40% felt that the PPE available to them offered adequate protection. Fit-testing of respirators had never been performed for 47% of respondents, and 49% reported at least one adverse effect from the use of PPE.","Ramanan, M.; Tabah, A.; Laupland, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172148v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172148v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
2,Post-discharge health status and symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19,"Background: Little is known about long-term recovery from severe COVID-19 disease. Here, we characterize overall health, physical health and mental health of patients one month after discharge for severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients [&ge;]18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS Global Health-10. Results: A total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p<0.001. Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state (43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state, (54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p <0.001. A total of 52/148 (35.1%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148 (13.5%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 disease typically experience sequelae affecting their respiratory status, physical health and mental health for at least several weeks after hospital discharge.","Weerahandi, H.; Hochman, K.

4,Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of the First Month of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Chile,"Introduction: Understanding the clinical course and outcomes of patients with Covid-19 in underrepresented populations like Latin America is paramount. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile, with a focus on subjects requiring hospitalization during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: This is a single center study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected within 24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Results: During the first month of the pandemic, 381 patients were confirmed as positive for SARS- CoV-2 by molecular testing; 88 (23.1%) of them eventually required hospitalization. Median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49). Overall mortality was 0.7% and 18 (3.7%) out of the 88 subjects who required hospitalization either died and/or required ICU. Increased body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and the SaTO2/FiO2 index on admission were independently associated with a higher risk of ICU care or death. Discussion: The lower mortality observed in our prospective cohort during the first month of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic was lower than previously reported. This finding could be due to a lower threshold for admission, a healthcare system not yet overburdened and a younger population, among other factors. BMI, CRP on admission were strong predictors for ICU care or all-cause, in- hospital mortality. Our data provide important information regarding the clinical course of Covid- 19 in Latin America.","Vial, M.

5,Drawing transmission graphs for COVID-19 in the perspective of network science,"When we consider a probability distribution about how many COVID-19 infected people will transmit the disease, two points become important. First, there should be super-spreaders in these distributions/networks and secondly, the Pareto principle should be valid in these distributions/networks. When we accept that these two points are valid, the distribution of transmission becomes a discrete Pareto distribution, which is a kind of power law. Having such a transmission distribution, then we can simulate COVID-19 networks and find super-spreaders using the centricity measurements in these networks. In this research, in the first we transformed a transmission distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science and secondly we try to determine who the super-spreaders are by using this network and eigenvalue centrality measure. We underline that determination of transmission probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and determining the precautions to be taken.","Gursakal, N.; Batmaz, B.; Aktuna, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172908v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172908v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
6,Lockdown Measures and their Impact on Single- and Two-age-structured Epidemic Model for the COVID-19 Outbreak in Mexico,"The role of lockdown measures in mitigating COVID-19 in Mexico is investigated using a comprehensive nonlinear ODE model. The model includes both asymptomatic and presymptomatic populations with the latter leading to sickness (with recovery, hospitalization and death possibilities). We consider the situation involving the imposed application of partial social distancing measures in the time series of interest and find optimal parametric fits to the time series of deaths (only), as well as to that of deaths and cumulative infections. We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definitiveness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproductive number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant. Finally, we consider what would be the impact on the number of deaths and cumulative infections upon imposition of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population).","Cuevas-Maraver, J.; Kevrekidis, P.; Chen, Q.-Y.; Kevrekidis, G.; Villalobos-Daniel, V.; Rapti, Z.; Drossinos, Y.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172833v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20172833v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
7,"Place and underlying cause of death during the COVID19 pandemic: retrospective cohort study of 3.5 million deaths in England and Wales, 2014 to 2020","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high death toll. We aimed to describe the place and cause of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This national death registry included all adult (aged [&ge;]18 years) deaths in England and Wales between 1st January 2014 and 30th June 2020. Analyses were based upon ICD-10 codes corresponding to the underlying cause of death as stated on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Daily deaths during COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020, by place and cause of death. Findings Between 2nd March and 30th June 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50603 (86.2%) were COVID-19 related. Almost half the excess deaths occurred in care homes (25611 deaths) where deaths were 55% higher than expected. One fifth of the excess deaths occurred in hospital (15938 deaths; a proportional increase of 21%) with the remainder occurring at home (16190 deaths; a proportional increase of 39%). At home, only 14% of 16190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5 963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, very few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% of the 25611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In hospital, there were 16174 fewer deaths than expected which did not involve COVID-19, and there were 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial increase in the absolute numbers of deaths occurring at home and care homes. There was a huge burden of excess deaths occurring in care homes, which were poorly characterised, and were likely to be, at least in part, the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, which suggests avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","Wu, J.; Mafham, M.; Mamas, M.; Rashid, M.; Kontopantelis, E.; Deanfield, J.; de Belder, M.; Gale, C.

8,Extensive Genetic Diversity and Host Range of Rodent-borne Coronaviruses,"To better understand the genetic diversity, host association and evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) in China we analyzed a total of 696 rodents encompassing 16 different species sampled from Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","Wang, W.; Lin, X.-D.; Zhang, H.-L.; Wang, M.-R.; Guan, X.-Q.; Holmes, E.

9,Face Coverings and Respiratory Tract Droplet Dispersion,"Respiratory droplets are the primary transmission route for SARS-CoV-2. Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we investigate the effectiveness of surgical masks and single-layer cotton masks on mitigating dispersion of large respiratory droplets (i.e. non aerosol). We tested a manikin ejecting fluorescent droplets and human volunteers in speaking and coughing conditions. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by >1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 1000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 5 cm away wearing a basic single layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets. If aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","Bandiera, L.; Pavar, G.; Pisetta, G.; Otomo, S.; Mangano, E.; Seckl, J.

10,Is Blood Type Associated with COVID-19 Severity?,"Blood type purportedly influences susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but whether it affects severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Therefore, we examined the association of blood type and rhesus with hospitalization and disease severity among 428 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system. In the sample, 50.2% of participants had the blood type O, 38.7% had the blood type A, 17.5% had the blood type B, and 3.5% had the blood type AB. In analysis adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, the blood types A (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.50), B (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.69), AB (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.20, 2.41), and O (OR: 1.18, 95%: 0.74, 1.98) were not associated with hospitalization for COVID-19. Similarly, the blood types A (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.65), B (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.84), AB (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.04, 2.44), and O (OR: 1.25, 95%: 0.73, 2.14) were not associated with admission to intensive care unit or death in COVID-19. In conclusion, blood type is not associated with hospitalization or disease severity in COVID-19; therefore, it may not be useful marker for identifying patients at risk for severe COVID-19.","Mendy, A.; Keller, J.

11,Development and Validation of a Simple Risk Score for Diagnosing COVID-19 in the Emergency Room,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate and place pressure on hospital system resources, a proper screening and risk stratification score is essential. We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analyzed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Nursing facility residence (2 points), sick contact (2 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point), and leukocytosis (-1 point) were included in the prediction score. A risk score for COVID-19 diagnosis achieved AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.92) in the development dataset and 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.90) in the validation dataset. A risk prediction score for COVID-19 can be used as a supplemental tool to assist clinical decision to triage, test, and quarantine patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room.","Sung, J.; Choudry, N.; Bachour, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173112v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173112v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
12,Trends in Covid-19 risk-adjusted mortality rates in a single health system,"Early reports showed high mortality from Covid-19; by contrast, the current outbreaks in the southern and western United States are associated with fewer deaths, raising hope that treatments have improved. However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors. Methods We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed/expected (O/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent. Results We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16). Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks. Discussion In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period. Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain. In summary, data from one health system suggest that Covid-19 remains a serious disease for high risk patients, but that outcomes may be improving.","Horwitz, L.; Jones, S. A.; Cerfolio, R.

13,Patient outcomes after hospitalisation with COVID-19 and implications for follow-up; results from a prospective UK cohort.,"Background: COVID19 causes a wide spectrum of disease. However, the incidence and severity of sequelae after the acute infection is uncertain. Data measuring the longer-term impact of COVID19 on symptoms, radiology and pulmonary function are urgently needed to inform patients and plan follow up services. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalised with COVID19 were prospectively recruited to an observational cohort with outcomes recorded at 28 days. All were invited to a systematic follow up at 12 weeks, including chest radiograph, spirometry, exercise test, blood tests, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires. Findings: Between 30th March and 3rd June 2020, 163 patients with COVID19 were recruited. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (IQR 2 to 8) and 30 patients required ITU or NIV, 19 patients died. At 12 weeks post admission, 134 were available for follow up and 110 attended. Most (74%) had persistent symptoms (notably breathlessness and excessive fatigue) with reduced HRQoL. Only patients with disease sufficiently severe to warrant oxygen therapy in hospital had abnormal radiology, clinical examination or spirometry at follow up. Thirteen (12%) patients had an abnormal chest X-ray with improvement in all but 2 from admission. Eleven (10%) had restrictive spirometry. Blood test abnormalities had returned to baseline in the majority (104/110). Interpretation: Patients with COVID19 remain highly symptomatic at 12 weeks, however, clinical abnormalities requiring action are infrequent, especially in those without a supplementary oxygen requirement during their acute illness. This has significant implications for physicians assessing patients with persistent symptoms, suggesting that a more holistic approach focussing on rehabilitation and general wellbeing is paramount.

15,Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","Papa, G.; Mallery, D.; Albecka, A.; Welch, L.; Cattin-Ortola, J.; Luptak, J.; Paul, D.; McMahon, H.; Goodfellow, I.

16,Metaviromic identification of genetic hotspots of coronavirus pathogenicity using machine learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major threat across the globe. Here, we developed machine learning approaches to identify key pathogenic regions in coronavirus genomes. We trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","Park, J.

17,Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate,"The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 would be greatly facilitated by the identification of immunological correlates of protection in humans. However, to date, studies on protective immunity have only been performed in animal models and correlates of protection have not been established in humans. Here, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing vessel associated with a high attack rate. Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002).","Addetia, A.; Crawford, K.

18,The Status and Risk Factors of COVID-19 Related Suicides in Bangladesh,"In addition to physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global economy and mental health significantly. The economic and social consequence has sparked many psychological mediators. In severe cases, they led to suicidal behavior in individuals like as seen in the 1918-1919 flu pandemic and in the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Previously, a few articles have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all these articles talked about sporadic cases of suicides with no clear picture of the holistic overview of suicides in Bangladesh. Herein, we looked into all COVID-19 suicide cases from March 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi media. Our study also reports the risk factors contributing to suicidal incidents. Moreover, we also identified the impact of gender, profession, and COVID-19 diagnosis status on committing suicide. This study will shed light on the topic with a clear understanding of the causalities influencing individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it will help the policymakers to take necessary actions to prevent any further suicides.","Boshra, S. N.; Islam, M.

In light of the recent pandemic, we use Google Search data to explore online interest about COVID-19 and related topics in 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Method: Data from Google Trends from 2019/12/30 to 2020/04/25 regarding COVID-19 and other related topics were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and with national epidemiological indicators. Results: The Latin American and Caribbean countries with the most interest for COVID-19 were Peru (100%) and Panama (98.39%). No correlation was found between this interest and national epidemiological indicators. The global and local response time were 20.2{+/-}1.2 days and 16.7{+/-}15 days, respectively. The duration of public attention was 64.8{+/-}12.5 days. The most popular topics related to COVID-19 were: the country's situation (100{+/-}0) and coronavirus symptoms (36.82{+/-}16.16). Most countries showed a strong or moderated (r=0.72) significant correlation between searches related to COVID-19 and daily new cases. In addition, the highest significant lag correlation was found on day 13.35{+/-}5.76 (r=0.79). Conclusions: Interest shown by Latin American and Caribbean countries for COVID-19 was high. The degree of online interest in a country does not clearly reflect the magnitude of their epidemiological indicators. The response time and the lag correlation were greater than in European and Asian countries. Little interest was found for preventive measures. Strong correlation between searches for COVID-19 and daily new cases suggests a predictive utility that should be investigated by further studies.","Aragon-Ayala, C.

20,Federated Learning of Electronic Health Records Improves Mortality Prediction in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19,"Machine learning (ML) models require large datasets which may be siloed across different healthcare institutions. Using federated learning, a ML technique that avoids locally aggregating raw clinical data across multiple institutions, we predict mortality within seven days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patient data was collected from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. Both the federated LASSO and federated MLP models performed better than their local model counterparts at four hospitals. The federated MLP model also outperformed the federated LASSO model at all hospitals. Federated learning shows promise in COVID-19 EHR data to develop robust predictive models without compromising patient privacy.","Vaid, A.; Jaladanki, S.

21,Development of a standards-based city-wide health information exchange for public health in response to COVID-19,"Background: Disease surveillance is a critical function of public health, provides essential information about disease burden, clinical and epidemiologic parameters of disease, and is an important element to effective and timely case and contact tracing. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the essential role these functions have to preserve public health. Syndromic surveillance, electronic laboratory reporting in the meaningful use program, and the growth of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) have created linkages between hospitals, commercial labs, and public health that can collect and organize data, often through EHR and order workflows, to improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting. In theory, the standard data formats and exchange methods provided by meaningful use should enable rapid healthcare data exchange in the setting of disruptive healthcare events like a pandemic. In reality, access to data remains challenging, and even if available, often lack conformity to regulated standards. Objective: We sought to use regulated interoperability standards already in production to generate regional bed capacity awareness, enhance the capture of epidemiological risk factors and clinical variables among COVID-19 tested patients, and reduce the administrative burden of reporting for stakeholders in a manner that could be replicated by other public health agencies. Methods: Following a public health order mandating data submission, we developed technical infrastructure to combine multiple data feeds from electronic health record systems. We measured the completeness of each feed, and the match rate between feeds. Results: A cloud-based environment was created that received data from electronic lab reporting, consolidated clinical data architecture, and bed capacity data feeds from sites. Data governance was planned from the project beginning to aid in consensus and principles for data use. 88,906 total persons from CCDA data among 14 facilities, and 408,741 persons from ELR records among 88 facilities, were submitted. Fields routinely absent from ELR feeds included travel histories, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities. CCDA data provided an improvement in the quality of data available for surveillance and was highly complete with <5% for all records types with the exception of patient cell phone. 90.1% of records could be matched between CCDA and ELR feeds. Conclusions: We describe the development of a city-wide public health data hub for the surveillance of COVID-19 infection. We were able to assess the completeness of existing ELR feeds, augment these feeds with CCDA documents, establish secure transfer methods for data exchange, develop cloud-based architecture to enable secure data storage and analytics, and produced meaningful dashboards for the monitoring of capacity and disease burden. We see this public health and clinical data registry as an informative example of the power of common standards across electronic records, and a potential template for future extension of the use of standards to improve public health surveillance.","Hota, B.; Casey, P.; McIntyre, A.

22,ACE2 expression in adipose tissue is associated with COVID-19 cardio-metabolic risk factors and cell type composition,"COVID-19 severity has varied widely, with demographic and cardio-metabolic factors increasing risk of severe reactions to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms for this remain uncertain. We investigated phenotypic and genetic factors associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. In a meta-analysis of three independent studies including up to 1,471 participants, lower adipose tissue ACE2 expression was associated with adverse cardio-metabolic health indices including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity status, higher serum fasting insulin and BMI, and lower serum HDL levels (P<5.32x10-4). ACE2 expression levels were also associated with estimated proportions of cell types in adipose tissue; lower ACE2 expression was associated with a lower proportion of microvascular endothelial cells (P=4.25x10-4) and higher macrophage proportion (P=2.74x10-5), suggesting a link to inflammation. Despite an estimated heritability of 32%, we did not identify any proximal or distal genetic variants (eQTLs) associated with adipose tissue ACE2 expression. Our results demonstrate that at-risk individuals have lower background ACE2 levels in this highly relevant tissue. Further studies will be required to establish how this may contribute to increased COVID-19 severity.","El-Sayed Moustafa, J. S.; Jackson, A. U.; Brotman, S. M.; Guan, L.; Villicana, S.; Roberts, A.

23,Precise Prediction of COVID-19 in Chest X-Ray Images Using KE Sieve Algorithm,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is pressurizing the healthcare systems across the globe and few of them are on the verge of failing. The detection of this virus as early as possible will help in contaminating the spread of it as the virus is mutating itself as fast as possible and currently there are about 4,300 strains of the virus according to the reports. Clinical studies have shown that most of the COVID-19 patients suffer from a lung infection similar to influenza. So, it is possible to diagnose lung infection using imaging techniques. Although a chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest X-ray is more widely available across the hospitals due to its considerably lower cost and faster imaging time than CT scan. The advancements in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition has resulted in intelligent systems that analyze CT Scans or X-ray images and classify between pneumonia and normal patients. This paper proposes KE Sieve Neural Network architecture, which helps in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. This architecture is achieving an accuracy of 98.49%.

24,Quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater solids in communities with low COVID-19 incidence and prevalence,"In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore reduce pressures on health-care units, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty. Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through measuring trends of viral RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. = 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. = 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human eukaryotic 18S rRNA, making PMMV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","D'Aoust, P.

25,Temporal Dynamics of Viral Load and False Negative Rate Influence the Levels of Testing Necessary to Combat COVID19 Spread,"Many colleges and other organizations are considering testing plans to return to operation as the COVID19 pandemic continues. The temporal dynamics of viral load and test false negative rate have the potential to alter the apparent efficacy of testing, as testing must identify a sick individual prior to that person transmitting the virus to one or more people and isolate them. High levels of pre-symptomatic spread and high false negative rates for testing would therefore be likely to make it difficult to successfully test an individual in the time frame necessary to stop viral spread. Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. We find that the undetectable period of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate of ~17% in the presence of a hypothetical perfect test, while full implementation of dynamic false negative rates reported in the literature leads to an overall false negative rate of ~48%. We then compare testing while varying fraction of the population and the frequency of testing. We find that these assumptions about viral load and false negative rate lead to a requirement for high levels of both frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent R0 below 1. We conclude that models that do not consider the non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate may come up with unrealistic testing plans that will not lead to the desired reduction in apparent R0.","Jarvis, K.

However, conventional approaches exclude double-zero-event studies (DZS) from meta-analyses. We assessed whether including such studies impacts the conclusions in a recent systematic urgent review on prevention measures for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. Study designs and settings: We extracted data for meta-analyses containing DZS from a recent review that assessed the effects of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission. A bivariate generalized linear mixed model was used to re-do the meta-analyses with DZS included. We compared the synthesized relative risks (RRs) of the three prevention measures, their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and significance tests (at the level of 0.05) including and excluding DZS. Results: The re-analyzed COVID-19 data containing DZS involved a total of 1,784 participants who were not considered in the original review. Including DZS noticeably changed the synthesized RRs and 95% CIs of several interventions. For the meta-analysis of the effect of physical distancing, the RR of COVID-19 decreased from 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.73) to 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.98). For several meta-analyses, the statistical significance of the synthesized RR was changed. The RR of eye protection with a physical distance of 2 m and the RR of physical distancing when using N95 respirators were no longer statistically significant after including DZS. Conclusions: DZS may contain useful information. Sensitivity analyses that include DZS in meta-analysis are recommended.","Xiao, M.; Lin, L.; Hodges, J.

30,"knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards Covid-19 among Palestinians during the Covid-19 outbreak: a cross sectional survey","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a highly contagious illness that spreads rapidly through human to human transmission. On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5th. The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people's knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19th and May 1st, 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) male respondents and (49%) female respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants knowledge and awareness of COVID19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the governments response to the pandemic. The overall correct mean of the knowledge was 79.26+-0.35. Most participants' expressed confidence that Covid19 would be successfully controlled and that Palestine could win the battle against Covid19, though 62% believed that stricter measurements must be applied. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public's understanding of COVID19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.","Qutob, N.; Awartani, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20170852v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20170852v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
31,ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ETHNICITY AND SEVERE COVID-19 DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.,"Background: Multiple reports suggested disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities. Whether ethnicity is an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness is unclear. Purpose: Review the association between ethnicity and poor Covid-19 outcomes including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, critical care admission, respiratory and kidney failure. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database up to 15/06/2020, and preprint servers. No language restriction. Study Selection: All studies providing ethnicity-aggregated data on the pre-specified outcomes, except case reports or interventional trials Data Extraction: Pairs of investigators independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), and rated certainty of evidence following GRADE framework. Data Synthesis: Seventy-two articles (59 cohort studies with 17,950,989 participants; 13 ecological studies; 54 US-based and 15 UK-based; 41 peer-reviewed) were included for systematic review and 45 for meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low, with median NOS of 7 (interquartile range 6-8). In the unadjusted analyses, compared to white ethnicity, all-cause mortality risk was similar in Black (RR:0.96 [95%CI: 0.83-1.08]), Asian (RR:0.99 [0.85-1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR:0.69 [0.57-0.84]). Age and sex-adjusted-risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR:1.38 [1.09-1.75]) and Asian (HR:1.42 [1.15-1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR:1.14 [0.93-1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these association to non-significance; Black (HR:0.95 [0.72-1.25]); Asian (HR:1.17 [0.84-1.63]); Hispanic (HR:0.94 [0.63-1.44]). Similar results were observed for other outcomes. In subgroup analysis, there is a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risks. Limitations: Paucity of evidence on native ethnic groups, and studies outside US and UK. Conclusions: Currently available evidence cannot confirm ethnicity as an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness, but indicates that disparity may be partially attributed to greater burden of comorbidities.

32,Superspreading k-cores at the center of COVID-19 pandemic persistence,"The spread of COVID-19 caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. To slow down the spread of the pandemic, mass quarantines have been implemented globally, provoking further social and economic disruptions. Here, we address this problem by implementing a large-scale contact tracing network analysis to find the optimal quarantine protocol to dismantle the chain of transmission of coronavirus with minimal disruptions to society. We track billions of anonymized GPS human mobility datapoints from a compilation of hundreds of mobile apps deployed in Latin America to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission before and after the confinements. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people's mobility across the region decreases by ~53%, which results in a drastic disintegration of the transmission network by ~90%. However, this disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, the optimal strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number of 'weak links' with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of an optimal tracing strategy to halt the pandemic. As countries race to build and deploy contact tracing apps, our results could turn into a valuable resource to help deploy protocols with minimized disruptions.","Serafino, M.; Monteiro, H.

33,Immediate Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak on Psychiatric Outpatients: Posttraumatic Stress and Influencing Factors,"We aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak and public health measures on the psychological well-being of patients with psychiatric disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed 436 outpatients recruited from a tertiary psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, nearly one month after the government introduced strict measures of lockdown against the ongoing outbreak. Respondents completed a web-based survey on sociodemographic data, subjective sleep quality, and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Respondents reported high frequencies of clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (32.6%, IES-R score equal to or above 33), anxiety (36.4%, HADS anxiety score > 10), and depression (51%, HADS depression score > 10). 20.5% of respondents described that their psychological status worsened during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 12.1% of respondents described poor or very poor sleep in the prior month. Positive predictors of increased PTSD symptoms included the chronic medical diseases, knowing someone in the social vicinity diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection, job loss or being on temporary leave after the outbreak, and increased exposure time to TV or social media. In contrast, male gender, older age, higher educational attainment, and the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and (to a lesser degree) bipolar disorder were the negative predictors. Our results suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are prone to substantial psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and various individual, behavioral, and social factors mediate this effect.","Poyraz, B.

34,Network reinforcement driven drug repurposing for COVID-19 by exploiting disease-gene-drug associations,"Currently, the number of patients with COVID-19 has significantly increased. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven computational approach could help reduce trial-and-error in finding treatment for COVID-19.","Nam, Y.; Yun, J.-S.; Lee, S. M.; Park, J.

36,Clinical and immunological factors that distinguish COVID-19 from pandemic influenza A(H1N1),"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a global health threat with the potential to cause severe disease manifestations in the lungs. Although clinical descriptions of COVID-19 are currently available, the factors distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses are unknown. Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia, and higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163 in influenza patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, interstitial lung pathology, increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-{gamma}) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1{beta}, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3, were observed in COVID-19 cases. We demonstrated the diagnostic potential of some clinical and immune factors to differentiate COVID-19 from pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against influenza. These findings might be relevant for the upcoming 2020-2021 influenza season, which is projected to be historically unique due to its convergence with COVID-19.","Choreno-Parra, J.

37,Validation of Saliva and Self-Administered Nasal Swabs for COVID-19 Testing,"Background Active cases of COVID-19 has primarily been diagnosed via RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swabs can be collected safely without trained staff. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and SN swabs compared to NP swabs in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore. Methods We recruited 200 male adult subjects: 45 with acute respiratory infection, 104 asymptomatic close contacts, and 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each subject underwent NP swab, SN swab and saliva collection for RT-PCR testing at 1 to 3 timepoints. We additionally used a direct-from-sample amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow to establish phylogeny. Results Of 200 subjects, 91 and 46 completed second and third rounds of testing, respectively. Of 337 sets of tests, there were 150 (44.5%) positive NP swabs, 127 (37.7%) positive SN swabs, and 209 (62.0%) positive saliva. Test concordance between different sample sites was good, with a kappa statistic of 0.616 for NP and SN swabs, and 0.537 for NP and saliva. In confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, the likelihood of a positive test from any sample fell beyond 14 days of symptom onset. NGS was conducted on 18 SN and saliva samples, with phylogenetic analyses demonstrating lineages for all samples tested were Clade O (GISAID nomenclature) and lineage B.6 (PANGOLIN nomenclature). Conclusion This study supports saliva as a sensitive and less intrusive sample for COVID-19 diagnosis and further delineates the role of oropharyngeal secretions in increasing the sensitivity of testing. However, SN swabs were inferior as an alternate sample type. Our study also provides evidence that a straightforward next-generation sequencing workflow can provide direct-from-sample phylogenetic analysis for public health decision-making.","Teo, A. K.

38,Influence of nursing staff working hours on the stress level during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional online survey,"Background: Working as a nurse means being responsive and highly accountable 24/7 and to be able to offer high-quality care, specifically during pandemics. Studies have shown that the average number of working hours per week is a significant predictor of stress and that the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the nurses stress levels. Objective: Therefore, we investigated (1) if a change had occurred in the nurses working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the hours employed and (2) the influence of the nursing staffs working hours during COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived level of stress. Design: We used an online survey in this Austrian cross-sectional study, distributed using a snowball sampling method. Participants and methods: In the online survey, we asked the nurses many relevant questions, including how many hours they are employed per week and how many hours they had worked on average per week since the outbreak of COVID-19. We used the Perceived Stress scale to measure stress level among these nurses. Data were collected between mid-May and mid-July 2020. Results: Three-quarters of the 2600 participating nurses reported changes in their working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nursing staffs hours of employment were statistically significantly associated with their average number of working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. About two-thirds of the nurses who were employed either less than 10 hours or for 31-40 hours worked for more than 40 hours. Most of the nurses experienced a moderate level of stress. We identified a statistically significant association between increasing the number of working hours per week and the nurses perceived stress level. In addition, 15% of the nurses who had worked more than 40 hours reported experiencing a high level of stress. In addition, we found that nurses who worked more hours during the pandemic experienced higher stress than nurses who reduced their working hours or kept the same working hours. Conclusions: We found a statistically significant association between an increase in the nursing staffs working hours and their level of stress. We believe that these results reflect the negative consequences of prolonged working hours. For this reason, a (inter-)national discussion is needed on the topic of restricting the working hours of healthcare workers during such pandemics. This discussion can improve the health and safety of the health care workers, the patients, as well as members of the general population.","Hoedl, M.; Bauer, S.; Eglseer, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173385v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173385v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,True
39,Severity Assessment of COVID-19 based on Clinical and Imaging Data,"Objectives This study aims to develop a machine learning approach for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 patients based on clinical and imaging data. Materials and Methods Clinical data, including demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities and blood test results and chest CT scans of 346 patients from two hospitals in the Hubei province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of clinical and imaging data by testing multiple machine learning models, and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalance distribution issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the SHAP framework. Results Targeting differentiation between mild and severe cases, logistic regression models achieved the best performance on clinical features (AUC:0.848, sensitivity:0.455, specificity:0.906), imaging features (AUC:0.926, sensitivity:0.818, specificity:0.901) and the combined features (AUC:0.950, sensitivity:0.764, specificity:0.919). The SMOTE oversampling method further improved the performance of the combined features to AUC of 0.960 (sensitivity:0.845, specificity:0.929). Discussion Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with findings from previous studies. Oversampling yielded mixed results, although it achieved the best performance in our study. Conclusions This study indicates that clinical and imaging features can be used for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 patients and have the potential to assist with triaging COVID-19 patients and prioritizing care for patients at higher risk of severe cases.

40,Strengthening Policy Coding Methodologies to Improve COVID-19 Disease Modeling and Policy Responses: A Proposed Coding Framework and Recommendations,"In recent months, multiple efforts have sought to characterize COVID-19 social distancing policy responses. These efforts have used various coding frameworks, but most have relied on binary coding that may not adequately describe the gradient in social distancing policies as states re-open. We developed a COVID-19 social distancing intensity framework that is sufficiently specific and sensitive to capture this gradient. Based on a review of policies from a 12-state sample, we developed a social distancing intensity framework consisting of 16 domains and intensity scales of 0-5 for each domain. We found that the states with the highest average daily intensity from our sample were Pennsylvania, Washington, Colorado, California, and New Jersey, with Georgia, Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas having the lowest. While some domains (such as restaurants and movie theaters) showed bimodal policy intensity distributions compatible with binary (yes/no) coding, others (such as childcare and religious gatherings) showed broader variability that would be missed without more granular coding. We also present a range of methodological recommendations to strengthen COVID-19 comparative policy coding efforts.","Lane, J.; Garrison, M.

41,Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-{gamma} and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.","Rodda, L.

42,"Obesity, old age and frailty are the true risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and not chronic disease or ethnicity in Croydon.","Background: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) mortality in hospitalised patients is strongly associated with old age, nursing home residence, male sex and obesity, with a more controversial association with ethnicity and chronic diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus. Further complicating the evaluation of the independent impacts of these risk factors is the failure to control for frailty in the published studies thus far. Aim: To determine the true risk factors for mortality in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 in Croydon needing hospital admission and to evaluate the independence of these risk factors in this group after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and frailty. Methods: This observational study retrospectively reviewed hospital electronic medical records of 466 consecutive patients who were admitted to Croydon University Hospital confirmed positive by rapid PCR test from 11th March 2020 to 9th April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple unconditional and univariate logistic regression. Results: After multivariate analysis, male sex [OR 1.44 (CI 0.92-2.40)], age (per year) [OR 1.07 (CI 1.05-1.09)], morbid obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2 vs reference BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ) [OR 14.8 (CI 5.25-41.8)], and nursing home residence (OR 3.01 (CI 1.56-5.79) were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality with no statistically significant association found with chronic diseases or ethnicity. In the non-nursing home population, after adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor was 1.64 (CI 1.03-2.61, p = 0.03) and was and was attenuated to 1.30 (CI 0.78-2.18)) after controlling for BMI; the association of mortality with male sex was strengthened [OR 1.66 (CI 0.96-2.87)] and that for ethnic minority patients was weakened [South Asians [from OR 1.30 (CI 0.67-2.53)) to OR 1.21 (CI 0.60-2.46)]; African Caribbeans [from OR 1.24 (CI 0.65-2.34) to OR 1.16 (CI 0.58-2.30)]. There was a borderline but potentially large protective effect (p= 0.09) in patients who were on anticoagulation drugs prior to admission [OR 0.56 (CI 0.28-1.11)]. Conclusion: Our study found no significant effect of ethnicity and chronic diseases as independent risk factors on COVID-19 mortality in Croydon population whereas male sex, high BMI, old age and frailty were found to be independent risk factors. Routine prophylactic treatment with anticoagulant drugs in the high-risk COVID-19 population warrants further prompt investigation.","Philipose, Z.; Smati, N.; Wong, C. S. J.; Aspey, K.; Mendall, M.

43,LAMP-BEAC: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Using RT-LAMP and Molecular Beacons,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, resulting in the need for rapid assays to allow diagnosis and prevention of transmission. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but tests are expensive and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses alternative and often cheaper reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, complicating detection. Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in ""single pot"" reactions.","Sherrill-Mix, S.; Hwang, Y.; Roche, A.

We compared the performance of three immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a well-characterized sera-panel. 379 sera/plasma samples from RT-PCR positive individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic individuals and 184 pre-pandemic samples were used. The sensitivity of the assays were 84.7, 82.6 and 75.7 respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5% and 100%, respectively. The RBD and LIAISON (S1/S2) assays showed high agreement (94.7%;95%CI:92.0,96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positives than Kavach.

45,Frontline healthcare workers' knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and willingness to work during the pandemic in Nepal: a nationwide cross-sectional web-based study,"Abstract Background The health sector's effectiveness during a pandemic primarily depends on the availability, knowledge, skills, perceptions, and motivations of frontline healthcare workers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contextual factors associated with the knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Methods A total of 1051 frontline health-workers from all seven Nepalese provinces were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, which was conducted in May 2020. Using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, we collected information on knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent associations between predictors and outcome variables. Results Of the 1051 frontline health-workers, 17.2% were found to have inadequate knowledge on COVID-19, 63.6% reported unsatisfactory perceptions of government response, and 35.9% showed an unwillingness to work during the pandemic. Health workers at local health facilities (AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) and those with chronic diseases were less likely to have adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Nurses (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.38-3.18), health-workers from Karnali Province (AOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.53), and those who had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.51-6.16) were more likely to have satisfactory perception towards government response to COVID-19. In addition, laboratory-workers, health workers from Karnali province, and those with adequate knowledge (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.27-2.58) were more likely to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions We concluded that frontline healthcare workers have some gaps in knowledge-related to COVID-19; about two-thirds of them had a negative perception of government response, and nearly one-third of them were unwilling to work. These observations demonstrate that prompt actions are required to improve health-worker knowledge of COVID-19, address negative perceptions to government responses, and motivate them to provide healthcare services during the pandemic.

46,Integrating psychosocial variables and societal diversity in epidemic models for predicting COVID-19 transmission dynamics,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments must make decisions based on a variety of information including estimations of infection spread, health care capacity, economic and psychosocial considerations. The disparate validity of current short-term forecasts of these factors is a major challenge to governments. By causally linking an established epidemiological spread model with dynamically evolving psychosocial variables, using Bayesian inference we estimate the strength and direction of these interactions for German and Danish data of disease spread, human mobility, and psychosocial factors based on the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO; N = 16,981). We demonstrate that the strength of cumulative influence of psychosocial variables on infection rates is of a similar magnitude as the influence of physical distancing. We further show that the efficacy of political interventions to contain the disease strongly depends on societal diversity, in particular group-specific sensitivity to affective risk perception. As a consequence, the model may assist in quantifying the effect and timing of interventions, forecasting future scenarios, and differentiating the impact on diverse groups as a function of their societal organization. Importantly, the careful handling of societal factors, including support to the more vulnerable groups, adds another direct instrument to the battery of political interventions fighting epidemic spread.","Jirsa, V.; Petkoski, S.; Wang, H.; Woodman, M.; Fousek, J.; Betsch, C.; Felgendreff, L.; Bohm, R.; Lilleholt, L.; Zettler, I.; Faber, S.; Shen, K.; McIntosh, A.

47,Pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in severe COVID-19 A proof-of-concept study,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) can develop into a severe respiratory syndrome that results in up to 40% mortality. Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to accumulation of bradykinin. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in significant changes in disease mortality and time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds promoted significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which has been reported as an indicator of disease recovery. In this small cohort, we found evidence for a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","Mansour, E.; Palma, A.

48,Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 exhibit strong association with increased genome-wide mutation load,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for human cases of COVID-19, a pandemic with global impact that first emerged in late 2019. Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Oktay, Y.; Karakülah, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,False
49,Maraviroc inhibits SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and s-protein mediated cell fusion in cell culture,"In an effort to identify therapeutic intervention strategies for the treatment of COVID-19, we have investigated a selection of FDA-approved small molecules and biologics that are commonly used to treat other human diseases. A screen of 19 small molecules and 3 biologics was conducted in cell culture and the impact of treatment on viral titer was quantified by plaque assay. The screen identified 4 FDA-approved small molecules, Maraviroc, FTY720 (Fingolimod), Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Confocal microscopy with over expressed S protein demonstrated that Maraviroc reduced the extent of S-protein mediated cell fusion as observed by fewer multinucleate cells in drug-treated cells. Mathematical modeling of drug-dependent viral multiplication dynamics revealed that prolonged drug treatment will exert an exponential decrease in viral load in a multicellular/tissue environment. Taken together, the data demonstrate that Maraviroc, Fingolimod, Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture.","Risner, K.; Tieu, K.

50,Attenuated influenza virions expressing the SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain induce neutralizing antibodies in mice,"An effective vaccine is essential to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we describe an influenza-virus-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. We incorporated a membrane-anchored form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in place of the neuraminidase (NA) coding sequence in an influenza virus also possessing a mutation that reduces the affinity of hemagglutinin for its sialic acid receptor. The resulting {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu virus can be generated by reverse genetics and grown to high titers in cell culture. A single-dose intranasal inoculation of mice with {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu elicits serum neutralizing antibody titers against SAR-CoV-2 comparable to those observed in humans following natural infection (~1:250). Furthermore, {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu itself causes no apparent disease in mice. It might be possible to produce a vaccine similar to {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu at scale by leveraging existing platforms for production of influenza vaccines.","Loes, A. N.; Gentles, L. E.; Greaney, A.

51,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike harbours a lipid binding pocket which modulates stability of the prefusion trimer,"Large trimeric Spikes decorate SARS-CoV-2 and bind host cells via receptor binding domains (RBDs). We report a conformation in which the trimer is locked into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the locked form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity/pathogenicity of released virus. These results reveal a potentially druggable pocket and suggest that the natural prefusion state occludes neutralising RBD epitopes, achieving conformational shielding from antibodies.","Carrique, L.; Duyvesteyn, H.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3'-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baddock, H.

53,Deciphering the state of immune silence in fatal COVID-19 patients,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 has appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to immune silence in patients facing death.","Bost, P.; De Sanctis, F.; Cane, S.; Ugel, S.; Donadello, K.; Castellucci, M.; Eyal, D.; Fiore, A.; Anselmi, C.; Barouni, R.

57,Membrane Nanoparticles Derived from ACE2-rich Cells Block SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic worldwide necessitates the development of novel effective agents against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells. Our study demonstrates a easy-to-acheive memrbane nano-antagonist for curbing SARS-CoV-2, which enriches the existing antiviral arsenal and provides new possibilities to treat COVID-19.

Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication, assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","Pei, R.; Feng, J.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, H.; Li, L.; Yang, X.; He, J.; Xiao, S.; Xiong, J.; Lin, Y.; Wen, K.; Zhou, H.; Chen, J.; Rong, Z.; Chen, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
59,Worldwide tracing of mutations and the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.","Zhou, Z.-Y.; Liu, H.; Zhang, Y.-D.; Wu, Y.-Q.; Peng, M.-S.; Li, A.; Irwin, D.

60,Suppression of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses by NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.

ImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Wang, P.; Li, X.; Kuang, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False

Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating coronavirus infections. In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved non-structural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP binding site.

62,Efficacy of Targeting SARS-CoV-2 by CAR-NK Cells,"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is one of greatest global pandemics in history. No effective treatment is currently available for severe COVID-19 disease. One strategy for implementing cell-based immunity involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology. Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Ma, M.

63,Rapid endothelialitis and vascular inflammation characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung-on-chip model,"BackgroundSevere manifestations of COVID-19 include hypercoagulopathies and systemic endothelialitis. The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.

MethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.

InterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.

64,Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2,"A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is urgently needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","Walls, A.

66,TRIM28 regulates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by targeting ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into human cells. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs.

Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. The UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction at 3.36 [A] resolution provides molecular details into how critical residues within the Nsp15 active site recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond, whereas the apo-states reveal active site conformational heterogeneity.

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins were considered a potential intermediate host. To assemble the coronavirus found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 were used a reference genome in most of studies, assuming that pangolins CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in the evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Y.; Yan, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False

70,Development of CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as a subunit vaccine against COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, T.-Y.; Lin, M.-Y.; Coffman, R. L.; Campbell, J.

72,Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, G.; Kenney, A.

73,Post-exertion oxygen saturation as a prognostic factor for adverse outcome in patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19: Observational cohort study,"Background Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019).

74,Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.

This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","Gruca, A.; Ziemska-Legiecka, J.; Jarnot, P.; Sarnowska, E.; Sarnowski, T.; Grynberg, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
75,K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","Yinda, C.

76,Mass molecular testing for COVID19 using NGS-based technology and a highly scalable workflow,"Since first reported case of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, researchers and governments have witnessed an unseen rise in the number of cases. Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID, a Varstation feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID on Varstation. Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","Malta, F. d. M.; Amgarten, D. E.; Val, F. C.; Santana, R. A. F.; Cervato, M. C.; de Azevedo, B. M. C.; Basqueira, M. d.

77,"Pleiotropic effect of Lactoferrin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection: in vivo, in silico and in vitro preliminary evidences","The current treatments against SARS-CoV-2 have proved so far inadequate. A potent antiviral drug is yet to be discovered. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, secreted by exocrine glands and neutrophils, possesses an antiviral activity extendable to SARS-Cov-2.

We performed a randomized, prospective, interventional study assessing the role of oral and intra-nasal lactoferrin to treat mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to prevent disease evolution. Lactoferrin induced an early viral clearance and a fast clinical symptoms recovery in addition to a statistically significant reduction of D-Dimer, Interleukin-6 and ferritin blood levels. The antiviral activity of lactoferrin related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells and protein-protein docking methods, provided the direct recognition between lactoferrin and spike S, thus hindering the spike S attachment to the human ACE2 receptor and consequently virus entering into the cells.

Lactoferrin can be used as a safe and efficacious natural agent to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.","Campione, E.; Lanna, C.; Cosio, T.; Rosa, L.; Conte, M.

No clear relationship between their weakly basic and hydrophobic nature upon their activity was observed.

79,Petabase-scale sequence alignment catalyses viral discovery,"Public sequence data represents a major opportunity for viral discovery, but its exploration has been inhibited by a lack of efficient methods for searching this corpus, which is currently at the petabase scale and growing exponentially. To address the ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and expand the known sequence diversity of viruses, we aligned pangenomes for coronaviruses (CoV) and other viral families to 5.6 petabases of public sequencing data from 3.8 million biologically diverse samples. To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, Serratus, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of CoV and CoV-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community. Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of CoV and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.","Edgar, R.

80,High throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq next generation sequencing,"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time.

81,Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals That Some Mutations May Affect On Both Spike Structure Damage and Ligand Binding Site,"There are some mutations are known related to SARS-CoV-2. Together with these mutations known, we tried to show other newly mutations regionally. According to our results which 4326 whole sequences are used, we found that some mutations occur only in a certain region, while some other mutations are found in each regions. Especially in Asia, more than one mutation(three different mutations are found in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) was seen in the same sequence. Although we detected a huge number of mutations (we found more than seventy in Asia) by regions, some of them were predicted that damage spikes protein structure by using bioinformatic tools. The predicted results are G75V(isolated from North America), T95I(isolated from South Korea), G143V(isolated from North America), M177I(isolated Asia), L293M(isolated from Asia), P295H(isolated from Asia), T393P(isolated from Europe),P507S(isolated from Asia), D614G(isolated from all regions) respectively. Also, in this study, we tried to show how possible binding sites of ligands change if the spike protein structure is damaged and whether more than one mutation affects ligand binding was estimated using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly, mutations that predicted to damage the structure do not affect ligand binding sites, whereas ligands binding sites were affected in those with multiple mutations. Focusing on mutations may opens up the window to exploit new future therapeutic targets.","Aktas, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244632v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244632v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False
82,A potent neutralizing nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 with inhaled delivery potential,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. The unprecedented scale and severity call for rapid development of effective prophylactics or therapeutics. We here reported Nanobody (Nb) phage display libraries derived from four camels immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), from which 381 Nbs were identified to recognize SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Furthermore, seven Nbs were shown to block interaction of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-variants, bat-SL-CoV-WIV1-RBD and SARS-CoV-1-RBD. Among the seven candidates, Nb11-59 exhibited the highest activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 with ND50 of 0.55 g/mL. Nb11-59 can be produced on a large-scale in Pichia pastoris, with 20 g/L titer and 99.36% purity. It also showed good stability profile, and nebulization did not impact its stability. Overall, Nb11-59 might be a promising prophylactic and therapeutic molecule against COVID-19, especially through inhalation delivery.

83,"Comparative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 binding (IgG, IgM, IgA) and neutralizing antibodies from human serum samples","A newly identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","Mazzini, L.; Martinuzzi, D.; Hyseni, I.; Lapini, G.; Benincasa, L.; Piu, P.; Trombetta, C.

The potential of SARS-CoV-2 evolution to create novel dangerous variants remains underexplored. Thus, we passaged SARS-CoV-2 in defined conditions and determined its genomic adaptation dynamics. We demonstrate the presence of remarkably stable SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. We further show that the quasispecies nature of the virus population ensured rapid adaptation of the spike PRRARS motif upon passaging in Vero cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2 expressing cells led to a reverse mutation at the same site. We observed the emergence of novel mutations in envelope protein upon virus culture in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. Finally, we show that the heparan sulfate-binding motif (PRRARS) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein acted as a determinant of negative growth selection. Overall, our research has far-reaching implications for development of antiviral strategies, suggesting viral quasispecies may facilitate rapid emergence of escape mutants under selection pressure, such as the treatment with antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","Chaudhry, M.

85,K18-hACE2 Mice for Studies of COVID-19 Treatments and Pathogenesis Including Anosmia,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","Perlman, S.; Zheng, J.; WONG, L.

86,"Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 deletion variants detected in a nosocomial cluster during routine genomic surveillance, Lyon, France","Through routine genomic surveillance of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (n=229 whole genome sequences), 2 different frameshifting deletions were newly detected in the open reading frame (ORF) 6, starting at the same position (27267). While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.

ImportanceWhile the SARS-CoV-2 genome has remained relatively stable since its emergence in the human population, genomic deletions are an evolutionary pattern previously described for the related SARS-CoV. Real-time genomic monitoring of the circulating variants is paramount to detect strain prevalence and transmission dynamics. Given the role of ORF6 in interferon modulation, further characterization, such as mechanistic interactions and interferon monitoring in patients, is crucial in understanding the viral-host factors driving disease evolution.","Queromes, G.; Destras, G.; Bal, A.; Regue, H.; Burfin, G.; Brun, S.; Fanget, R.; Morfin, F.; Valette, M.; Lina, B.; Frobert, E.; Josset, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.241653v1?rss=1,2020-08-10,2020-08-10,,False

88,DC/L-SIGN recognition of spike glycoprotein promotes SARS-CoV-2 trans-infection and can be inhibited by a glycomimetic antagonist,"The efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a pandemic that is unique in modern history. Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection.

89,Sofosbuvir Terminated RNA is More Resistant to SARS-CoV-2 Proofreader than RNA Terminated by Remdesivir,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, resulting in the largest pandemic in over a hundred years. After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic. These results offer a molecular basis supporting the current use of Sofosbuvir in combination with other drugs in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Jockusch, S.; Tao, C.; Li, X.; Chien, M.; Kumar, S.; Morozova, I.; Kalachikov, S.; Russo, J.

90,Bi-paratopic and multivalent human VH domains neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting distinct epitopes within the ACE2 binding interface of Spike,"Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","Bracken, C.

If the 3CLpro is inhibited, the functional virus proteins cannot form and the virus cannot replicate and assemble. Any compound that inhibits the 3CLpro is therefore a potential drug to end the pandemic. Here we show that the diffraction power of 3CLpro crystals is effectively destroyed by Ebselen. It appears that Ebselen may be a widely available, relatively cost effective way to eliminate the SARS coronavirus 2.","Malla, T.

92,An ultra-high affinity synthetic nanobody blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection by locking Spike into an inactive conformation,"Without an effective prophylactic solution, infections from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","Schoof, M.; Faust, B.; Saunders, R.

93,Nonstructural protein 1 of SARS-CoV-2 is a potent pathogenicity factor redirecting host protein synthesis machinery toward viral RNA.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects millions of people worldwide with a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.

94,The interplay of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and constraints imposed by the structure and functionality of its proteins,Fast evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides us with unique information about the patterns of genetic changes in a single pathogen in the timescale of months. This data is used extensively to track the phylodynamic of the pandemics spread and its split into distinct clades. Here we show that the patterns of SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations along its genome are closely correlated with the structural features of the coded proteins. We show that the foldability of proteins 3D structures and conservation of their functions are the universal factors driving evolutionary selection in protein-coding genes.

95,Generation of tonsil organoids as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Palatine tonsil (hereinafter referred to as ""tonsil"") plays role in the immune systems first line of defense against foreign pathogens. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic since the infection was first reported in China in December 2019. The aim of this study was to establish tonsil epithelial cell-derived organoids and to examine their feasibility as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an optimized protocol, we achieved 3D tonsil organoid culture from human tonsil tissue that reflects the distinctive characteristics of the tonsil epithelium, such as its cellular composition, histologic properties, and molecular biological features. Notably, we verified that SARS-CoV-2 can infect tonsil organoids with a robust replication efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with remdesivir, an antiviral agent, effectively protected them from viral infection. Therefore, tonsil organoids could be available for investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pathology and for preclinical screening of novel antiviral drug candidates.

96,"Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in human airway epithelial cells under physiological and pathological conditions: Implications for SARS-CoV2 infection","SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from donors with different physiological and pathological backgrounds such as smoking, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, or viral infections. By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

97,"SARS-CoV-2 infection, neuropathogenesis and transmission among deer mice: Implications for reverse zoonosis to New World rodents","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in November, 2019 in China and rapidly became pandemic. As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.","Fagre, A.; Lewis, J.; Eckley, M.; Zhan, S.; Rocha, S.

98,mRNA induced expression of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in mice for the study of the adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting in nearly 20 million infections across the globe, as of August 2020. Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","Hassert, M.; Geerling, E.; Stone, E.

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, F.; Mears, J.
