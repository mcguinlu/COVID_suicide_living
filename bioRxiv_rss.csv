0,Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses,"To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from four patients, all with low or undetectable antibody response. Our data suggests that the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may correlate to risk for shedding live SARS-CoV-2 virus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Glans, H.; Gredmark-Russ, S.; Olausson, M.; Falck-Jones, S.; Varnaite, R.; Christ, W.; Maleki, K.

1,Development of a serological assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While molecular assays are used to detect viral genetic material for the diagnosis of acute infection, reliable serological assays are needed to measure immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: the full-length spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Our assay is sensitive and specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM anti-S protein and anti-RBD antibodies. Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This method provides a high-throughput assay that does not require specialized instrumentation and can be widely used to determine immunity and the dynamic range of antibodies found within SARS-CoV-2.","Huynh, A.; Arnold, D.

2,On Machine Learning-Based Short-Term Adjustment of Epidemiological Projections of COVID-19 in US,"Epidemiological models have provided valuable information for the outlook of COVID-19 pandemic and relative impact of different mitigation scenarios. However, more accurate forecasts are often needed at near term for planning and staffing. We present our early results from a systemic analysis of short-term adjustment of epidemiological modeling of COVID 19 pandemic in US during March-April 2020. Our analysis includes the importance of various types of features for short term adjustment of the predictions. In addition, we explore the potential of data augmentation to address the data limitation for an emerging pandemic. Following published literature, we employ data augmentation via clustering of regions and evaluate a number of clustering strategies to identify early patterns from the data. From our early analysis, we used CovidActNow as our underlying epidemiological model and found that the most impactful features for the one-day prediction horizon are population density, workers in commuting flow, number of deaths in the day prior to prediction date, and the autoregressive features of new COVID-19 cases from three previous dates of the prediction. Interestingly, we also found that counties clustered with New York County resulted in best preforming model with maximum of R2= 0.90 and minimum of R2= 0.85 for state-based and COVID-based clustering strategy, respectively.","KEFAYATI, S.; Huang, H.; Chakraborty, P.; Roberts, F.; Gopalakrishnan, V.; Srinivasan, R.; Pethe, S.; Madan, P.; Deshpande, A.; Liu, X.; Hu, J.; Jackson, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20180521v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
3,Mask-Wearing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background Masks have been widely recommended as a precaution against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","Aravindakshan, A.; Boehnke, J.; Gholami, E.; Nayak, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
4,RAAS blockers and region-specific variations in COVID-19 outcomes: findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved as a global crisis with high mortality seen in elderly and people with cardiometabolic diseases. The use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers in these patients is known to enhance the expression of ACE-2, the chief binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and may potentially enhance infectivity. Objective: To provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blocker usage on COVID-19 outcomes. Data Sources: An electronic literature search was performed for published (using MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar) and preprint (using bioRxiv and medRxiv) studies of interest. The last search was conducted on 9th July 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting data on RAAS blocker use and COVID-19 mortality and severity were included in the review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Mortality data and severity data including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, steroid use and acute kidney injury (AKI) were recorded. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) estimates were reported with 95% CIs and level of heterogeneity (I2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds of mortality in users of RAAS blockers with respect to non-users was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, steroid use, and AKI in users with respect to non-users of RAAS blockers were the secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1348 articles identified, 48 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26432 patients from 31 studies included in mortality analysis and 20127 patients from 23 studies included in severity analysis. Majority of the studies (41.6%) were from China. No increased risk of mortality (Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65-1.26), I2=89%) or severity (Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79-1.46), I2=88%) was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension (pooled OR 0.63 (0.46-0.86), I2=58%). Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was found to be high for Europeans (Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52-2.85), I2=77%) and US patients (Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62-2.17) in users of RAAS-blockers. A nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization, two times higher risk of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was observed in US patients on RAAS blockers. No net effect on mortality and severity outcomes was seen in Chinese patients. RAAS blocker usage did not have any effect on corticosteroid use and AKI in Chinese patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of RAAS blockers is not associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Reduced mortality is seen in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and therefore the drugs should be continued in this subset. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenomic differences may explain the ethnicity related variations.","Kaur, U.; Chakrabarti, S. S.; Patel, T.

5,Seroprevalence and Correlates of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Healthcare Workers in Chicago,"Background: Identifying factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW)s may help health systems optimize SARS-CoV-2 infection control strategies. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Northwestern HCW SARS-CoV-2 Serology Cohort Study. The Abbott Architect Nucleocapsid IgG assay was used to determine seropositivity. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics and self-reported community exposure to COVID-19) were fit to quantify the associations between occupation group, healthcare delivery tasks, and community exposure and seropositive status. Results: 6,510 HCWs, including 1,794 nurses, and 904 non-patient facing administrators participated. The majority were women (79.6%), 74.9% were white, 9.7% were Asian, 7.3% were Hispanic and 3.1% were Black. The crude prevalence rate of seropositivity was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.6%-5.2%). Out-of-hospital exposure to COVID-19 occurred in 9.3% of HCWs and was strongly associated with seropositivity (OR=4.7, 95% CI: 3.5-6.4). When compared to administrators, nursing was the only occupation group with a significantly higher adjusted-odds (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9) of seropositivity. Exposure to COVID-19 patients was reported by 37.8% of participants and was associated with higher positivity than those not exposed (OR= 2.2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.0). Being exposed to patients receiving high-flow oxygen therapy, and hemodialysis also remained significantly associated with a 45% and 57% higher odds for seropositive status, respectively. Conclusions: Exposure to COVID-19 patients, and longer duration patient therapies were each associated with higher risk for seropositive status; however, the community burden of COVID-19 remains a significant source of exposure to SARS CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Chicago.","Wilkins, J.; Gray, E.

6,SARS2 simplified scores to estimate risk of hospitalization and death among patients with COVID-19,"Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 based on the medical history of patients, simplified risk prediction models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.","Dashti, H.; Roche, E.; Bates, D.; Mora, S.; Demler, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20190520v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20190520v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
7,Taste alteration in COVID-19: a rapid review with data synthesis reveals significant geographical differences,"To facilitate a timely understanding of the differences in the prevalence of gustatory disturbances (GD) in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, we undertook a rapid systematic review of articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) and medRxiv from their inception until September 3, 2020. The minimum requirements for completing a restricted systematic review were met. Of the 431 articles retrieved, 61 eligible studies (28,374 confirmed COVID-19 cases) from 20 countries were included in the analysis. The results show strong significant differences in the overall reported prevalence of GD between East Asia [13%, 95% CI 0.14-26.06%], Middle East [38.83%, 95% CI 27.47-50.19%], Europe [57.18%, 95% CI 52.35-62.01%], and The Americas [66.78%, 95% CI 54.77-78.79%]. There were no trends showing differences of prevalence of GD in the available literature between February and August,, 2020. These data show that there is a distinct geographical distribution of GD in COVID-19 patients and this may explain the differences of diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 case definition.","Cirillo, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192831v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192831v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
8,The major predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic hospitalized patients,"The major predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic hospitalized patients Samson Barasa,1 Amy Ballard,1 Josephine Kiage-Mokaya, 1 Michael Friedlander,1 Geraldine Luna,2 1PeaceHealth Sacred Heart 2University of Illinois at Chicago Introduction: Increasing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pre-test probability can minimize testing patients who are less likely to have COVID-19 and therefore reducing personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing kit use. The aim of this study was to identify patients who were likely to test positive for COVID-19 among symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 during hospitalization by comparing COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Method: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were [&ge;]18 years old and underwent COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction test because they presented with symptoms thought to be due to COVID-19. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted after clinical presentation, demographic, medical co-morbidities, laboratory and chest image data was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Charts of 277 and 18 COVID-19 negative and positive patients respectively were analyzed. Dyspnea (61%) was the most common symptom among COVID-19 negative patients, while 72% and 61% COVID-19 positive patients had cough and fever respectively. COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to present initially with cough [1.082 (1.022 - 1.145)], fever [1.066 (1.014 - 1.121)] and be 50 to 69 years old [1.094 (1.021 - 1.172)]. Dyspnea, weakness, lymphopenia and bilateral chest image abnormality were not associated with COVID-19 positivity. COVID-19 positive patients were less likely to have non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [1.068 (1.019 - 1.119)], human immunodeficiency virus [0.849 (0.765 - 0.943)] and heart failure history [0.093 (0.891 - 0.978)]. Other chronic medical problems (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease) were not associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Cough, fever and being 50 to 69 years old are better predictors of symptomatic COVID-19 positivity during hospitalization. Despite published studies reporting a high prevalence of lymphopenia among COVID-19 positive patients, lymphopenia is not associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19.

9,Serological evidence of human infection with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: A rapidly increasing number of serological surveys for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been reported worldwide. A synthesis of this large corpus of data is needed. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of serological studies and provide a global picture of seroprevalence across demographic and occupational groups, and to provide guidance for conducting better serosurveys. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN and Wellcome were searched for English-language papers published from December 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Study selection: Serological studies that evaluated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Data extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies. Data Synthesis: Most of 178 serological studies, representing tests in >800,000 individuals, identified were of low quality. Close contacts and high-risk healthcare workers had higher seroprevalence of 22.9% (95% CI: 11.1-34.7%) and 14.9% (4.8-25.0%), compared to low-risk healthcare workers and general population of 5.5% (4.6-6.4%) and 6.3% (5.5-7.1%). Generally, young people (0-20 yrs) were less likely to be seropositive compared to the middle-aged (21-55 yrs) populations (RR, 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-0.8). Seroprevalence correlated with clinical COVID-19 reports with 10 (range: 2 to 34) infections per confirmed COVID-19 case. Limitations: Some heterogeneity cannot be well explained quantitatively. Conclusions: The overall quality of seroprevalence studies examined was low. The relatively low seroprevalence among general populations suggest that in most settings, antibody-mediated herd immunity is far from being reached. Given that ratio of infections to confirmed cases is on the same order of magnitude across different locales, reported case numbers may help provide insights into the proportion of the population infected.

10,The Effect of Early Hydroxychloroquine-based Therapy in COVID-19 Patients in Ambulatory Care Settings: A Nationwide Prospective Cohort Study,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven effective therapy nor vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.","Sulaiman, T.; Mohana, A.; Alawdah, L.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Wani, T.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; AlKhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; AlAnazi, M.; Alqahtani, M.; Abdalla, K.; Yousif, Y.; AboGazalah, F.; Awwad, F.; AlabdulKareem, K.; AlGhofaili, F.; AlJedai, A.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
11,Anakinra and Intravenous IgG versus Tocilizumab in the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory failure and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Studies have suggested promising outcomes using monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1{beta} (Anakinra) or IL6 (Tocilizumab), however no head to head comparison was done between the two treatments. Herein, we report our experience in treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm with either subcutaneous Anakinra given concomitantly with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or intravenous Tocilizumab. Methods: Comprehensive clinical and laboratory data from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our hospital between March and May 2020 were collected. Patients who received either Anakinra/ IVIG or Tocilizumab were selected. Baseline characteristics including oxygen therapy, respiratory status evaluation using ROX index, clinical assessment using NEWS score and laboratory data were collected. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, ICU admission and length of stay. In addition, we compared the change in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers at days 7 and 14 post initiation of therapy. Results: 84 consecutive patients who received either treatment (51 in the Anakinra/ IVIG group and 33 in the Tocilizumab group) were retrospectively studied. Baseline inflammatory markers were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference regarding to death (21.6% vs 15.2%, p 0.464), intubation (15.7% vs 24.2%, p 0.329), ICU need (57.1% vs 48.5%, p 0.475) or length of stay (13+9.6 vs 14.9+11.6, p 0.512) in the Anakinra/IVIG and Tocilizumab, respectively. Additionally, the rate of improvement in ROX index, NEWS score and inflammatory markers was similar in both groups at days 7 and 14. Furthermore, there was no difference in the incidence of superinfection in both groups. Conclusion: Treating COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storm features with either subcutaneous Anakinra/IVIG or intravenous Tocilizumab is associated with improved clinical outcomes in most subjects. The choice of treatment does not appear to affect morbidity or mortality. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our study findings.

12,Automatic Contact Tracing for Outbreak Detection UsingHospital Electronic Medical Record Data,"Contact tracing is a well-known tool for public health professionals to trace and isolate contacts of known infectious persons. During a pandemic contact tracing is critical to ending an outbreak, but the volume of cases makes tracing difficult without adequate staffing tools. Hospitals equipped with electronic medical records can utilize these databases to automatically link cases into possible transmission chains and surface potential new outbreaks. While this automatic contact tracing does not have the richness of contact tracing interviews, it does provide a way for health systems to highlight potential super-spreader events and support their local health departments.

13,Temporal Analysis of COVID-19 Peak Outbreak,"Intent of this research is to explore how a specific class of mathematical models namely Susceptible-Infected-Removed model can be utilized to forecast peak outbreak timelines of COVID-19 epidemic amongst a population of interest starting from the date of first reported case. Till the time of this research, there was no effective and universally accepted vaccine to control transmission and spread of this infection. COVID-19 primarily spreads in population through respiratory droplets from an infected person cough and sneeze which infects people who are in proximity. COVID-19 is spreading contagiously across the world. If health policy makers and medical experts could get early and timely insights into when peak infection rate would occur after first reported case, they could plan and optimize medical personnel, ventilators supply, and other medical resources without over-taxing the infrastructure. The predictions may also help policymakers devise strategies to control the epidemic, potentially saving many lives. Thus, it can aid in critical decision-making process by providing actionable insights into COVID-19 outbreak by leveraging available data.","Tewari, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192229v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192229v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
14,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Associated with SARS-CoV-2; a Multinational Case Series,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 induced coagulopathy can lead to thrombotic complications such as stroke. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[&le;]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","Mowla, A.; Shakibajahromi, B.; Shahjouei, S.; Borhani-Haghighi, A.; Rahimian, N.; Baharvahdat, H.; Naderi, S.; Khorvash, F.; Altafi, D.; Ebrahimzadeh, S.

15,Adapting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling to accommodate imperfect tests: application to COVID-19 serosurveillance in Haiti,"Background: Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), a tool used for monitoring health indicators in low resource settings resulting in ""high"" or ""low"" classifications, assumes that determination of the trait of interest is perfect. This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.","Fulcher, I.

16,Clinical effectiveness of drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Objective. The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of drugs used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. Method. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization), virological clearance, and severe adverse events. Results. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Ten articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. Conclusions. Dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. Significance of results. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries; since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.

18,"Impact and Correlation of Air Quality and Climate Variables with COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality in Dhaka, Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly stopped the steady life and enhanced environmental quality. To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0 with STD of 37.9 and 87.1 with STD of 52.8 microgram m-3, and 427 with STD of 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10 drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020 (before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The average NO2 concentration was 35.0 micromol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0 micromol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.","Salam, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193086v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193086v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
19,"Ventilation and the SARS-CoV-2 CoronavirusAnalysis of outbreaks in a restaurant and on a bus in China,and at a Call Center in South Korea","In a previous paper [10] a model of the distribution of respiratory droplets and aerosols by Lagrangian turbulent air-flow was developed. It is used to show how the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus can be spread by the breathing of single infected person. The model shows that the concentration of viruses in the cloud, exhaled by one person, can increase to infectious levels within a certain amount of time, in a confined space where the air re-circulates. In [10] the model was used to analyze the air-flow and SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus build-up in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China [19,18]. In this paper, we add the analysis of two more cases, an outbreak among lay-Buddhists, on a bus [26], traveling to a ceremony in Zhejiang province, China, and an outbreak in a Call Center in Seoul, Korea [20]. The analysis and comparison of these three cases, leads to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus attacks in two steps: The first step is a linear spread between individuals with a couple of days delay. The second step is an exponential spread effected by the air-conditioning system affecting a much larger number of people. Thus in the second step, the ventilation becomes the super-spreader.","Birnir, B.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192997v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192997v1?rss=1,2020-09-13,2020-09-13,,True
20,Ignoring the elephant in the room: factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in South Africa.,"Background: Evidence have shown that the prescribed lockdown and social distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made accessing essential health care much more difficult in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to contraception is essential and should not be denied, even in the time of a global crisis because it is associated with health benefits. It is paramount to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to inadequate access to contraception and sources of contraception during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa (SA). Method: The first secondary dataset on coronavirus from the National Income Dynamic Study (NIDS) conducted in SA during the coronavirus pandemic was employed in this study. This study involved 6,829 respondents. Data was analysed using chi-square and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Over one-quarter of South Africans could not access contraception and more than every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public or government hospital as source of contraception. Female South Africans (OR=0.89 CI:0.7487-1.0719) and those aged 65 years above (OR=0.67 CI:0.4485-0.9988) were 33% and 11% respectively less likely to have access to contraception. The preferred sources of contraception were associated with the selected demographic and economic variables at P<0.05. Conclusions: Findings from the study suggests strategies and interventions that will be tailored towards non-obstruction of contraception access during the on-going COVID-19 or any future pandemic. Moreover, special consideration should be given to certain provinces and those in 3rd quintile of wealth income.","Bolarinwa, O.

21,Inferring MHC interacting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes recognized by TCRs towards designing T cell-based vaccines,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome mediated by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and was declared by WHO as a major international public health concern. While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mohseni, A.

Unregulated cytokine storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of {gamma}{delta} T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective {gamma}{delta} T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly.","Ryu, S.; Shchukina, I.; Youm, Y.-H.; Qing, H.; Hilliard, B.

23,Immunologically distinct responses occur in the CNS of COVID-19 patients,"A subset of patients with COVID-19 display neurologic symptoms but it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 damages the central nervous system (CNS) directly through neuroinvasion, or if neurological symptoms are due to secondary mechanisms, including immune-mediated effects. Here, we examined the immune milieu in the CNS through the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in circulation through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Single cell sequencing with paired repertoire sequencing of PBMCs and CSF cells show evidence for unique immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Strikingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in the CSF of all patients studied, but the antibody epitope specificity in the CSF and relative prevalence of B cell receptor sequences markedly differed when compared to those found in paired serum. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that localized CNS immune responses occur following viral neuroinvasion, and that the CSF is a faithful surrogate for responses occurring uniquely in the CNS. These results illuminate CNS compartment-specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, forming the basis for informed treatment of neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Song, E.; Chow, R.

24,Type I Interferon Limits Viral Dissemination-Driven Clinical Heterogeneity in a Native Murine Betacoronavirus Model of COVID-19,"Emerging clinical data demonstrates that COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, is a syndrome that variably affects nearly every organ system. Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.","Qing, H.; Sharma, L.; Hilliard, B.

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. We showed that the decoration of S494 with core and elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2 interface with more favorable binding free energies for longer oligosaccharides. Hence, the further drug design attempts should take this crucial factor into account, while suggesting any novel therapeutic candidate.","Rahnama, S.; Azimzadeh Irani, M.; Amininasab, M.; Ejtehadi, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.294504v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.12.294504v1?rss=1,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
26,Daytime variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production,"Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.","Diallo, A.

To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation.

28,Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat due to the lack of effective drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19.","Gao, D.; Li, F.; Han, M.; Dai, P.; Xu, W.; He, J.; Tao, X.; Wu, Y.; Tong, X.; Xia, X.; Guo, W.; Li, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Zhang, X.; Liu, Z.; Aji, R.; Cai, X.; Li, Y.; Qu, D.; Chen, Y.; Jiang, S.; Wang, Q.; Ji, H.; Xie, Y.; Sun, Y.; Lu, L.; Zhou, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293035v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.293035v1?rss=1,2020-09-12,2020-09-12,,False
29,"Covid-19 epidemic curve in Brazil: A sum of multiple epidemics, whose income inequality and population density in the states are correlated with growth rate and daily acceleration","Introduction: Recently, we demonstrated that the polynomial interpolation method can be used to accurately calculate the daily acceleration of cases and deaths by Covid-19. The acceleration of new cases is important for the characterization and comparison of epidemic curves. The objective of this work is to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazilian states. Methods: This is an ecological study with time series analysis of new cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federation units. Using the polynomial interpolation method, we calculated the daily cases and deaths with the measurement of the respective acceleration. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data. Results: The combination of daily data and acceleration determined that the states of Brazil are in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum acceleration of peak cases, peak of cases, maximum acceleration of deaths and peak of deaths are associated with the Gini index and population density, but did not correlate with HDI and per capita income. Conclusion: Brazilian states showed heterogeneous data curves. Densitypopulation and socioeconomic inequality are associated with worse control of the epidemic.","Rodrigues, C. A.; Pinto, A.

30,Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID-19 pandemic in Chile,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic reduction on the utilisation of healthcare services are reported in different contexts. Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities on access to healthcare. Aim: To evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender-based perspective. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference approach. We compared the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. We defined weeks 12 to 26 as an intervention period and the actual year as a treatment group. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. To test heterogeneity by sex, we included an interaction term between difference-in-difference estimator and sex. Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.","Pacheco, J.; Crispi, F.; Alfaro, T.; Martinez, M.

31,Use of Unofficial Newspaper Data for COVID-19 Death Surveillance,"Objective. To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID 19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID 19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID 19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.","Ahamad, M.

32,Hyaluronan is abundant in COVID-19 respiratory secretions,"COVID-19 respiratory infections are associated with copious, adherent respiratory secretions that prolong chronic ventilation and contribute to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease. We hypothesized that hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan produced at sites of active inflammation that promotes edema in other settings, might be a component of these secretions. To interrogate this, we examined the respiratory secretions collected from eight intubated patients with COVID-19, six control patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a different respiratory disease also associated with thick adherent secretions, and eight healthy controls. In this sample set we found that hyaluronan content is increased approximately 20-fold in both CF and COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The hyaluronan in COVID-19 samples was comprised of low-molecular weight fragments, the hyaluronan form most strongly linked with pro-inflammatory functions. Hyaluronan is similarly abundant in histologic sections from cadaveric lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. These findings implicate hyaluronan in the thick respiratory secretions characteristic of COVID-19 infection. Therapeutic strategies targeting hyaluronan should be investigated further for potential use in patients with COVID-19.","Kaber, G.; Kratochvil, M. J.; Burgener, E. B.; Peltan, E.

33,Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in England: detection by community antigen surveillance,"Background Based on cases and deaths, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England peaked in late March and early April 2020 and then declined until the end of June. Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K. E.

34,Bacterial pulmonary superinfections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Objectives While superinfections are associated with unfavourable disease course, their impact on clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the burden of superinfections in COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective single centre cohort study in an intensive care setting patients aged [&ge;] 18 years with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome were assessed for concomitant microbial infections by longitudinal analysis of tracheobronchial secretions, bronchoalveolar lavages and blood. Our primary outcome was ventilator-free survival on day 28 in patients with and without clinically relevant superinfection. Further outcomes included the association of superinfection with ICU length of stay, incidence of bacteremia, viral reactivations, and fungal colonization. Results In 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients, we identified 19 patients with superinfections (42.2%) by longitudinal analysis of 433 TBS, 35 BAL and 455 blood samples, respectively. On average, superinfections were detected on day 10 after ICU admission. The most frequently isolated clinically relevant bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ventilator-free survival was substantially lower in patients with superinfection (subhazard ratio 0.37, 95%-CI 0.15-0.90, p=0.028). Patients with pulmonary superinfections more often had bacteraemia, virus reactivations, yeast colonization, and needed ICU treatment for a significantly longer time. Conclusions The detection of superinfections was frequent and associated with reduced ventilator-free survival. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, superinfections lead to an extended ICU stay in COVID 19 patients. Longitudinal microbiological sampling in COVID-19 patients could allow targeted antimicrobial therapy, and therefore minimize the use of broad-spectrum and reserve antibiotics.","Buehler, P.

35,"Mortality and risk factors among US Black, Hispanic, and White patients with COVID-19","Background: Little is known about risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, particularly across diverse racial and ethnic populations in the United States. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we followed 3,086 COVID-19 patients hospitalized on or before April 13, 2020 within an academic health system in New York (The Mount Sinai Health System) until June 2, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The analysis was stratified by self-reported race and ethnicity. Findings: A total of 3,086 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, of whom 680 were excluded (78 due to missing race or ethnicity data, 144 were Asian, and 458 were of other unspecified race/ethnicity). Of the 2,406 patients included, 892 (37.1%) were Hispanic, 825 (34.3%) were black, and 689 (28.6%) were white. Black and Hispanic patients were younger than White patients (median age 67 and 63 vs. 73, p<0.001 for both), and they had different comorbidity profiles. Older age and baseline hypoxia were associated with increased mortality across all races. There were suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race and diabetes (p=0.09), and obesity (p=0.10). Among inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 mortality, there was a significant interaction between Black race and interleukin-1-beta (p=0.04), and a suggestive interactions between Hispanic ethnicity and procalcitonin (p=0.07) and interleukin-8 (p=0.09). Interpretation: In this large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients in New York City, we identified similarities and important differences across racial and ethnic groups in risk factors for in-hospital mortality.","Jun, T.; Nirenberg, S.; Kovatch, P.; Huang, K.-l.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190686v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190686v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
36,Identifying zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between Spike receptor-binding domain and host ACE2,"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","Huang, X.; Zhang, C.; Pearce, R.; Omenn, G.

37,A COVID-19 antibody curbs SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-induced complement hyper-activation,"Although human antibodies elicited by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein are profoundly boosted upon infection, little is known about the function of N-directed antibodies. Herein, we isolated and profiled a panel of 32 N protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from a quick recovery coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) convalescent, who had dominant antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 N protein rather than to Spike protein. The complex structure of N protein RNA binding domain with the highest binding affinity mAb nCoV396 reveals the epitopes and antigen's allosteric changes. Functionally, a virus-free complement hyper-activation analysis demonstrates that nCoV396 specifically compromises N protein-induced complement hyper-activation, a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in COVID-19, thus paving the way for functional anti-N mAbs identification.","Kang, S.; Yang, M.; He, S.; Wang, Y.; Chen, X.; Chen, Y.; Hong, Z.; Liu, J.; Jiang, G.; Chen, Q.; Zhou, Z.; Zhou, Z.; Huang, Z.; Huang, X.; He, H.; Zheng, W.; Liao, H.-X.; Xiao, F.; Shan, H.; Chen, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.292318v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.292318v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,False
38,A comparative survey of betacoronavirus strain molecular dynamics identifies key ACE2 binding sites,"Comparative functional analysis of the binding interactions between various betacoronavirus strains and their potential human target proteins, such as ACE1, ACE2 and CD26, is critical to our future understanding and combating of COVID-19. Here, employing large replicate sets of GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom fluctuations of the known human target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. We identify a common interaction site between the N-terminal helices of ACE2 and the viral RBD in all strains (hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV-2) and a second more dynamically complex RBD interaction site involving the ACE2 amino acid sites K353, Q325, and a novel motif, AAQPFLL (386-392) in the more recent cross-species spillovers (i.e. absent in hCoV-OC43). We use computational mutagenesis to further confirm the functional relevance of these sites. We propose a ""one touch/two touch"" model of viral evolution potentially involved in functionally facilitating binding interactions in zoonotic spillovers. We also observe these two touch sites governing RBD binding activity in simulations on hybrid models of the suspected viral progenitor, batCoV-HKU4, interacting with both the human SARS target, ACE2, and the human MERS target, CD26. Lastly, we confirm that the presence of a common hypertension drug (lisinopril) within the target site of SARS-CoV-2 bound models of ACE1 and ACE2 acts to enhance the RBD interactions at the same key sites in our proposed model. In the near future, we recommend that our comparative computational analysis identifying these key viral RBD-ACE2 binding interactions be supplemented with comparative studies of site-directed mutagenesis in order to screen for current and future coronavirus strains at high risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.","Rynkiewicz, P.

39,Functional interrogation of a SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome identifies unique and shared coronavirus host factors,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed nearly one million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis.

40,"Molecular Characterization, Phylogenetic and Variation Analyzes of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Turkey","Introduction: We present the sequence analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Methods: Illumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit -HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2. Results: All viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles. Conclusion: The results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.","Karamese, M.; Ozgur, D.; Tutuncu, E.

Its variant carrying mutated Spike (S) protein D614G (SD614G) has become the most prevalent form in the current global pandemic. We have identified a large panel of potential neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S. Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","Kumar, A.; Kumar, A.; Kumar, P.; Garg, N.; Giri, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.290932v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.290932v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,False
43,The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on emergency and elective hip surgeries in Norway,"Objective: To assess the effects of Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explore whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Methods: In 1.344.355 persons aged [&ge;]35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having 1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and 2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13th 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results: After-lockdown elective hip surgeries were one third the number of before-lockdown (IRR ~0.3), which is a greater drop than the drop seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ~0.6) (no age/sex differences). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR ~0.6), whereas women aged [&ge;]70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ~1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged [&ge;]70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR ~0.80) Conclusion: Important to note for future pandemics management is that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact on the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged [&ge;]35 but not for women aged [&ge;]70.","Magnusson, K.; Helgeland, J.; Grosland, M.; Telle, K.

44,Saliva as a potential clinical specimen for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,"Background It is almost nine months, still there is no sign to stop the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid and early detection of the virus is the master key to cease the rapid spread and break the human transmission chain. There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyse the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We used real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We use Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two sampling methods. Findings This study shows a lower CT mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) sampling method. Bland-Altman analysis produces relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these specimen tools. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and Spike gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. Interpretation: In conclusion, our study highlights that saliva represents a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of biggest concern in primary healthcare settings.","Bhattacharya, D.

45,Relationship between nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks and staff neighborhood characteristics,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on nursing homes in the US, with upwards of a third of deaths occurring in nursing homes, and more in long-term care facilities. By combining data on facility-level COVID-19 deaths with facility-level data on the neighborhoods where nursing home staff reside for a sample of eighteen states, this paper finds that staff neighborhood characteristics are a large and significant predictor of COVID-19 outbreaks. One standard deviation increases in average staff tract population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (SE .33), 1.4 (SE .35), and 0.9 (SE .24) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing home's own neighborhood characteristics. These results suggest that staff communities are likely to be an important source of infection, and that disparities in nursing home outbreaks may be related to differences in the types of neighborhoods nursing home staff live in.","Shen, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192203v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192203v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
46,Retrospective study of COVID-19 seroprevalence among tissue donors at the onset of the outbreak before implementation of strict lockdown measures in France,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered organ and tissue donations as well as transplantation practices. SARS-CoV-2 serological tests could help in the selection of donors. We assessed COVID-19 seroprevalence in a population of tissue donors, at the onset of the outbreak in France, before systematic screening of donors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods: 235 tissue donors at the Lille Tissue bank between November 1, 2019 and March 16, 2020 were included. Archived serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two FDA-approved kits. Results: Most donors were at higher risks for severe COVID-19 illness including age over 65 years (142/235) and/or presence of co-morbidities (141/235). According to the COVID-19 risk assessment of transmission, 183 out of 235 tissue donors presented with a low risk level and 52 donors with an intermediate risk level of donor derived infection. Four out of the 235 (1.7%) tested specimens were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 2 donors with anti-N protein IgG and 2 other donors with anti-S protein total Ig. None of them had both type of antibodies. Conclusion: Regarding the seroprevalence among tissue donors, we concluded that the transmission probability to recipient via tissue products was very low at the beginning of the outbreak.","Germain, N.; Herwegh, S.; Hatzfeld, A.

47,Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic: People's experiences and satisfaction with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,"Objectives: To determine how participants perceived telehealth consults in comparison to traditional in-person visits, and to investigate whether people believe that telehealth services would be useful beyond the pandemic. Design: A national cross-sectional community survey. Participants: Australian adults aged 18 years and over (n=1369). Main outcome measures: Telehealth experiences. Results: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (62%) rated their telehealth experience as ""just as good"" or ""better"" than a traditional in-person medical appointment. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic is over (M=3.67 out of 5, SD=1.1). Being male (p=0.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (p=0.037), or lower patient activation (individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health/healthcare) (p=0.037) were associated with a poorer telehealth experience. Six overarching themes were identified from free-text responses of why telehealth experience was poorer than a traditional in-person medical appointment: communication is not as effective; limitations with technology; issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology; reduced confidence in doctor; additional burden for complex care; and inability to be physically examined. Conclusions: Telehealth appointments were reported to be comparable to traditional in-person medical appointments by most of our sample. Telehealth should continue to be offered as a mode of healthcare delivery while the pandemic continues and may be worthwhile beyond the pandemic.","Isautier, J.

48,Evaluating ten commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) method.,"Numerous SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests have been developed, but their accuracy has usually been assessed using very few samples, and rigorous comparisons between these tests are scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests using the STARD methodology (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). 250 sera from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (collected from 0 to 32 days after onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests. Control sera (N=254) were retrieved from pre-COVID periods from patients with other coronavirus infections (N=11), positive rheumatoid factors (N=3), IgG/IgM hyperglobulinemia (N=9), malaria (n=5), or no documented viral infection (N=226). All samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) from ten manufacturers. Only four tests achieved [&ge;]98% specificity, with other tests ranging from 75.7%-99.2%. Sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection, from 31.7%-55.4% (Days 0-9), 65.9%-92.9% (Days 10-14), and 81.0%-95.2% (>14 days) after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Only three tests evaluated met French Health Authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests ([&ge;]90% sensitivity + [&ge;]98% specificity). Overall, the performances between tests varied greatly, with only a third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds. Knowing the analytical performance of these tests will allow clinicians to use them with more confidence, could help determine the general population's immunological status, and may diagnose some patients with false-negative RT-PCR results.","Dortet, L.; Ronat, J.-B.; Vauloup-Fellous, C.; Langendorf, C.; Mendels, D.-A.; Emeraud, C.; Oueslati, S.; Girlich, D.; Chauvin, A.; Afdjei, A.; Bernabeu, S.; Le Pape, S.; Kallala, R.; Rochard, A.; Verstuyft, C.; Fortineau, N.; Roque-Afonso, A.-M.; Naas, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192260v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20192260v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
49,High COVID-19 transmission potential associated with re-opening universities can be mitigated with layered interventions,"Background: Re-opening universities while controlling COVID-19 transmission poses unique challenges. UK universities typically host 20,000 to 40,000 undergraduate students, with the majority moving away from home to attend. In the absence of realistic mixing patterns, previous models suggest that outbreaks associated with universities re-opening are an eventuality. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model based on realistic mixing patterns between students. We evaluated alternative mitigation interventions for a representative university. Results: Our model predicts, for a set of plausible parameter values, that if asymptomatic cases are half as infectious as symptomatic cases then 5,760 (3,940 - 7,430) out of 28,000 students, 20% (14% - 26%), could be infected during the first term, with 950 (656 - 1,209) cases infectious on the last day of term. If asymptomatic cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases then three times as many cases could occur, with 94% (93% - 94%) of the student population getting infected during the first term. We predict that one third of infected students are likely to be in their first year, and first year students are the main drivers of transmission due to high numbers of contacts in communal residences. We find that reducing face-to-face teaching is likely to be the single most effective intervention, and this conclusion is robust to varying assumptions about asymptomatic transmission. Supplementing reduced face-to-face testing with COVID-secure interactions and reduced living circles could reduce the percentage of infected students by 75%. Mass testing of students would need to occur at least fortnightly, is not the most effective option considered, and comes at a cost of high numbers of students requiring self-isolation. When transmission is controlled in the student population, limiting imported infection from the community is important. Conclusions: Priority should be given to understanding the role of asymptomatic transmission in the spread of COVID-19. Irrespective of assumptions about asymptomatic transmission, our findings suggest that additional outbreak control measures should be considered for the university setting. These might include reduced face-to-face teaching, management of student mixing and enhanced testing. Onward transmission to family members at the end of term is likely without interventions.","Brooks-Pollock, E.; Christensen, H.; Trickey, A.; Hemani, G.; Nixon, E.; Thomas, A.; Turner, K.; Finn, A.; Hickman, M.; Relton, C.; Danon, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20189696v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.20189696v1?rss=1,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,,True
50,Mitochondrial induced T cell apoptosis and aberrant myeloid metabolic programs define distinct immune cell subsets during acute and recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection,"By interrogating metabolic programs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of acutely infected COVID-19 patients, we identified novel and distinct immune cell subsets Our studies identified a non-clonal population of T cells expressing high H3K27me3 and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to cell death. Characterized by dysmorphic mitochondria and increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c, apoptosis of these cells was inhibited by preventing VDAC aggregation or blocking caspase activation. Further, we observed a marked increase in Hexokinase II+ polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). While PMN-MDSC were also found in the PBMC of patients with other viral infections, the Hexokinase II+ PMN-MDSC were found exclusively in the acute COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease. Finally, we identified a population of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) expressing high carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1a) and VDAC, which were present in the PBMC of the acute COVID-19 patients, but not recovered COVID-19 patients and whose presence correlated with severity of disease. Overall, these unique populations of immune cells provide insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a means to predict and track disease severity as well as an opportunity to design and evaluate novel therapeutic regimens.","Thompson, E.; Cascino, K.; Ordonez, A.; Zhou, W.; Vaghasia, A.; Hamacher-Brady, A.; Brady, N.; Sun, I.-H.; Wang, R.; Rosenberg, A.; Delanoy, M.; Rothman, R.

51,Socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practice toward novel coronavirus among people living in Mosul-Iraq: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a worldwide pandemic, as the Iraqi authorities have started responding and taking action to control the spread of the pandemic. The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.911.67) and (21.562.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice towards the virus as P<0.05. Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.","Qubais, B.; Al-Shahrabi, R. m.; Bolarinwa, O.

52,Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality are driven by unequal infection risks.,"Background. As of August 5, 2020, there were more than 4.8M confirmed and probable cases and 159K deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with these numbers undoubtedly reflecting a significant underestimate of the true toll. Geographic, racial-ethnic, age and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality are key features of the first and second wave of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. Methods. We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. Findings. In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups other than Native Americans. Of these, Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age- standardized incidence = 1,644/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 251/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.6 (95% CI = 5.5, 5.7) and 6.9 (6.5, 7.3) times higher than Whites, respectively. We also found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. Interpretation. This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.

Our aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter regression methods to calibrate an established epidemiological model describing COVID-19 infection rates subject to active and varying non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). To do this, we assess the potential of some established chemical engineering modelling principles and practice for application to modelling of epidemiological systems. This allows us to exploit the sophisticated functionality of a commercial chemical engineering simulator capable of parameter regression with piecewise continuous integration and event and discontinuity management. Our results provide insights into the outcomes of on-going disease suppression measures, while visualisation of reported data also provides up-to-date condition monitoring of the status of the pandemic.

54,Early effect of the Covid-19 epidemic on vaccine coverage of major antigens in Guinea: an analysis of the interrupted time series of national immunization coverage,"Introduction: Since the declaration of the first case of Covid-19 on March 12, 2020, in Guinea, the number of COVID-19 cases has been increasing day by day despite the state of health emergency and the barrier measures decreed by the Guinean government. This present study aimed to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on vaccine activities by comparing current trends to trends over the past year when vaccine coverage of major antigens (BCG, OPV, DTP-HepB-Hib, MMR, IPV, and Td) had improved considerably. Methods: The study was carried out at the Expanded Vaccination Program (EPI) of the Republic of Guinea from February 2019 to June 2019. It was a comparative retrospective cohort study on the trends in administrative coverage of the different antigens used in the framework of vaccination. We performed interrupted time series (STI) analysis using the delayed dependent variable model ANCOVA type II Sum Squares with significance for a p-value less than 0.05 to confirm the link between the occurrence of Covid-19 and the collapse of vaccine coverage. These analyzes were performed on global vaccine-preventable disease surveillance data extracted from the District Immunization Data Management Tool (DVD-MT) designed by WHO. Estimates of the target population were obtained from the National Health Information System (SNIS), and surveillance data for Covid-19 patients were obtained from the National Health Security Agency (ANSS). Results: Overall, the EPI recorded a median vaccination coverage of less than 80% for all the vaccines introduced and the analysis of the interrupted time series shows that the interruption of the vaccination program was significant for all the vaccines. This finding is factual at both the national and district levels. However, there are disparities at this level, even though some districts have yet to report cases of COVID-19 but have experienced drop-in vaccination coverage. The comparison of vaccination coverage for DTP3, for example, shows a sharp drop in the prefectures of Yomou, N'Nzerekore, Macenta, Kankan, Mandiana, Dinguiraye, Mamou, Koubia, Mali, and Conakry, where it varies between 0 and 80% compared to 2019 where it was above 80%. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the need for a resilient health system that could adapt quickly and effectively to pandemics and which in turn makes it possible to strengthen EPI activities in Guinea during this period of a health crisis, in particular for children.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our hospital's current nosocomial infection control, we conducted a serological survey of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (immunoglobulin G) among the staff of our hospital, which is treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in the participants using a laboratory-based quantitative test (Abbott immunoassay), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. To investigate the factors associated with seropositivity, we also obtained some information from the participants with an anonymous questionnaire. Results: We invited 1133 staff members in our hospital, and 925 (82%) participated. The mean age of the participants was 40.0{+/-}11.8 years, and most were women (80.0%). According to job title, there were 149 medical doctors or dentists (16.0%), 489 nurses (52.9%), 140 medical technologists (14.2%), 49 healthcare providers (5.3%), and 98 administrative staff (10.5%). The overall prevalence of seropositivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.43% (4/925), which was similar to the control seroprevalence of 0.54% (16/2970)) in the general population in Osaka during the same period according to a government survey conducted with the same assay. Seropositive rates did not significantly differ according to job title, exposure to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, or any other investigated factors.

We further show that this test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual's immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test makes it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Bortz, R.

57,Distinct regimes of particle and virus abundance explain face mask efficacy for COVID-19,"Airborne transmission is an important transmission pathway for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Regions with a higher proportion of people wearing masks show better control of COVID-19, but the effectiveness of masks is still under debate due to their limited and variable efficiencies in removing respiratory particles. Here, we analyze experimental data and perform model calculations to show that this contrast can be explained by the different abundance regimes between particles and viruses. Upon short-term exposure, respiratory particles are usually in a particle-rich regime, but respiratory viruses are often in a virus-limited regime where the numbers of viruses inhaled by susceptible people are below or close to the infectious dose. This virus-limited regime ensures mask efficacy and synergy of multiple preventive measures in reducing the infection risk.","Cheng, Y.; Ma, N.; Witt, C.; Rapp, S.; Wild, P.; Andreae, M.

59,No association between circulating levels of testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin and risk of COVID-19 mortality in UK biobank,"Background: Sex-disaggregated data suggest that men with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are more likely to die than women. Whether circulating testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) contributes to such sex differences remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the associations of circulating total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and SHBG with COVID-19 mortality. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: We included 1306 COVID-19 patients (678 men and 628 women) who had serum TT and SHBG measurements and were free of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: The death cases of COVID-19 were identified from National Health Service death records updated at 31 July 2020. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality. Results: We documented 315 deaths of COVID-19 (194 men and 121 women). After adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find any statistically significant associations for TT (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.85-1.25), FT (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77-1.17), or SHBG (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.87-1.37) with COVID-19 mortality in men. Similar null results were observed in women (TT: OR per 1-SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.85-1.42; FT: OR per 1-SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.82-1.46; SHBG: OR per 1-SD increase = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.89-1.53).

61,SARS-CoV-2 detection by extraction-free qRT-PCR for massive and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis during a pandemic,"COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the healthcare and economy on a global scale. It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the infection spread as well as the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased demand in the rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated/pelleted samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral titer. Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity.

62,Evaluating the effects of cardiometabolic exposures on circulating proteins which may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 severity,"Background: Developing insight into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of critical importance to overcome the global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence SARS-CoV-2 severity was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P=0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in the bodys inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples. Interpretation: Our findings highlight several key proteins which are influenced by established exposures for disease. Future research to determine whether these circulating proteins mediate environmental effects onto risk of SARS-CoV-2 are warranted to help elucidate therapeutic strategies for covid-19 disease severity.","Richardson, T.

63,SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Prevalence and Association with Routine Laboratory Values in a Life Insurance Applicant Population,"Objectives: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population is largely unknown. Since many infections, even among the elderly and other vulnerable populations, are asymptomatic, the prevalence of antibodies could help determine how far along the path to herd immunity the general population has progressed. Also, in order to clarify the clinical manifestations of current or recent past COVID-19 illness, it may be useful to determine if there are any common alterations in routine clinical laboratory values. Methods: We performed SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on 50,130 consecutive life insurance applicants who were having blood drawn for the purpose of underwriting (life risk assessment). Subjects were also tested for lipids, liver function tests, renal function studies, as well as serum proteins. Other variables included height, weight, blood pressure at the time of the blood draw, and history of common chronic diseases (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer). Results: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.0%, and was fairly consistent across the age range and similar in males and females. Several of the routine laboratory tests obtained were significantly different in antibody-positive vs. antibody-negative subjects, including albumin, globulins, bilirubin, and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio. The BMI was also significantly higher in the antibody-positive group. Geographical distribution revealed a very high level of positivity in the state of New York compared to all other areas (17.1%). Using state population data from the US Census, it is estimated that this level of seropositivity would correspond to 6.98 million (99% CI: 6.56-7.38 million) SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, which is 3.8 times the cumulative number of cases in the US reported to the CDC as of June 1, 2020. Conclusions: The estimated number of total SARS-CoV-2 infections based on positive serology is substantially higher than the total number of cases reported to the CDC. Certain laboratory values, particularly serum protein levels, are associated with positive serology, though these associations are not likely to be clinically meaningful.","Rigatti, S.

64,Increased extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) reflects rapid inflammatory oedema and mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS,"OBJECTIVE: Nearly 5 % of the patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients. RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+/-}6.0%, p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","Rasch, S.; Schmidle, P.; Sancak, S.; Herner, A.; Huberle, C.; Schulz, D.; Mayr, U.; Schneider, J.; Spinner, C.; Geisler, F.; Schmid, R.

65,Conserved interactions required for in vitro inhibition of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires a fast development of antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50M concentration range. Our analysis and findings can facilitate and focus the development of highly potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Shitrit, A.; Zaidman, D.; Kalid, O.; Bloch, I.; Doron, D.; Yarnizky, T.; Buch, I.; Segev, I.; Ben-Zeev, E.; Segev, E.; Kobiler, O.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.288720v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.288720v1?rss=1,2020-09-10,2020-09-10,,False

Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding, and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","Greaney, A. J.; Starr, T.

67,Inhibitor binding influences the protonation states of histidines in SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","Pavlova, A.; Lynch, D.

The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies.

70,Molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 spike affinity for human ACE2 receptor,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantially more infections, deaths, and economic disruptions than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2s higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2s spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoVs spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2s higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2s spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2s higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","Delgado, J.

71,COVID-19 Biomarkers in research: Extension of the OncoMX cancer biomarker data model to capture biomarker data from other diseases.,"Scientists, medical researchers, and health care workers have mobilized worldwide in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; SCoV2). Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA,TNF-{propto}, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2). These trends align with proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology.

72,Real-time conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spikes on virus particles,"SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mediates entry into cells and is critical for vaccine development against COVID-19. Structural studies have revealed distinct conformations of S, but real-time information that connects these structures, is lacking. Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences of convalescent plasma and antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and conformations for immunogen design.","Lu, M.; Uchil, P. D.; Li, W.; Zheng, D.; Terry, D.

73,Epigenetic Evolution of ACE2 and IL-6 Genes as Non-Canonical Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlate to COVID-19 Susceptibility in Vertebrates,"Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally within a matter of months. The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19-susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non-ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","Sang, E.

74,Small molecules inhibit SARS-COV-2 induced aberrant inflammation and viral replication in mice by targeting S100A8/A9-TLR4 axis,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Guo, Q.; Zhao, Y.; Li, J.; Liu, J.; Qin, C.; Wang, X.; You, F.; Guo, X.; Zhang, Z.; Cao, L.; Luo, Y.; Wang, X.; Wei, X.; Chen, L.; Bao, L.; Deng, W.; Zhu, H.; Gao, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False

Research to identify effective therapies for COVID19 includes: i) designing a vaccine as future protection; ii) structure-based drug design; and iii) identifying existing drugs to repurpose them as effective and immediate treatments. To assist in drug repurposing and design, we determined two apo structures of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 main protease at ambienttemperature by Serial Femtosecond X-ray crystallography. We employed detailed molecular simulations of selected known main protease inhibitors with the structures and compared binding modes and energies.

76,Initial insights into the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala suggest local spread from limited introductions,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread from a city in China to almost every country in the world, affecting millions of individuals. Genomic approaches have been extensively used to understand the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. Kerala is a unique state in India well connected with the rest of the world through a large number of expatriates, trade, and tourism. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported in Kerala in January 2020, during the initial days of the pandemic. The rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases in the state of Kerala has necessitated the understanding of the genetic epidemiology of circulating virus, evolution, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2. We sequenced a total of 200 samples from patients at a tertiary hospital in Kerala using COVIDSeq protocol at a mean coverage of 7,755X. The analysis identified 166 unique high-quality variants encompassing 4 novel variants and 89 new variants identified for the first time in SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from India. Phylogenetic and haplotype analysis revealed that the circulating population of the virus was dominated (94.6% of genomes) by three distinct introductions followed by local spread, apart from identifying polytomies suggesting recent outbreaks. The genomes formed a monophyletic distribution exclusively mapping to the A2a clade. Further analysis of the functional variants revealed two variants in the S gene of the virus reportedly associated with increased infectivity and 5 variants that mapped to five primer/probe binding sites that could potentially compromise the efficacy of RT-PCR detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive report of genetic epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala.","Radhakrishnan, C.; Divakar, M.

Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of the illness. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 individuals. IgA responses in plasma generally correlate with IgG responses and clones of IgM, IgG and IgA producing B cells that are derived from common progenitors are evident. Plasma IgA monomers are 2-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form in the nasopharynx, are on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers. Thus, secretory IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.","Wang, Z.; Lorenzi, J. C.

78,Potential impact on coagulopathy of gene variants of coagulation related proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2,"Thrombosis has been one of the complications of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.

Author summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.","Holcomb, D.; Alexaki, A.; Hernandez, N.; Laurie, K.; Kames, J.; Hamasaki-Katagiri, N.; Komar, A.

Analyses of proteins such as primary receptors and co-receptors (co-factors) that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells will provide important clues to help control the virus. Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates that were present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through the use of proximity labeling and proteomics analysis. The identified proteins represent candidate key factors that may be required for viral entry. Our results indicated that a number of membrane proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133, were identified to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells that were used to expand the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

80,Structural Genetics of circulating variants affecting the SARS CoV-2 Spike / human ACE2 complex,"SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral Spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these results with the current mutational status of these amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 10 distinct patients: N439K, G476S, S477N and N501Y. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.

Significance StatementWe developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","Ortuso, F.; Mercatelli, D.; Guzzi, P.

81,Transcriptomic dysregulations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human nasopharyngeal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"IntroductionOver 24 million people have been infected globally with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, with more than 820,000 succumbing to the resulting COVID-19 disease as of the end of August 2020. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.

MethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.

ResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups.

ConclusionOur results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

84,Interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 with host receptome through spike protein,"Host cellular receptors are key determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.","Lu, Z.; Gu, Y.; Cao, J.; Zhang, X.; Gao, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhang, J.; Shen, G.; Jiang, X.; Yang, J.; Zheng, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, C.

Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","Stuible, M.; Gervais, C.; Lord-Dufour, S.; Perret, S.; L'Abbe, D.; Schrag, J.; St-Laurent, G.; Durocher, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False
86,A prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and prevents lung infection in non-human primates,"To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine against the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD  up, two-RBD  down state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel.

87,UVA radiation could be a significant contributor to sunlight inactivation of SARS-CoV-2,"Past experiments demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by simulated sunlight; models have considered exclusively mechanisms involving UVB acting directly on RNA. However, UVA inactivation has been demonstrated for other enveloped RNA viruses, through indirect mechanisms involving the suspension medium. We propose a model combining UVB and UVA inactivation for SARS-CoV-2, which improves predictions by accounting for effects associated with the medium. UVA sensitivities deduced for SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with data for SARS-CoV-1 under UVA only. This analysis calls for experiments to separately assess effects of UVA and UVB in different media, and for including UVA in inactivation models.

Lay summaryRecent experiments have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by simulated sunlight; however, there are still many unknowns, including the mechanism of action and which part of the light spectrum is principally responsible. Our analysis indicates the need for targeted experiments that can separately assess the effects of UVA and UVB on SARS-CoV-2, and that sunlight inactivation models may need to be expanded to also include the effect of UVA. A first UVA-inclusive model is also proposed here. These findings have implications for how to improve the safety of the built environment, and for the seasonality of COVID-19.","Luzzatto-Fegiz, P.; Temprano-Coleto, F.; Peaudecerf, F. J.; Landel, J.

88,"Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein correlates with, but does not predict neutralization","Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA and neutralization assays we observed a strong correlation between these two parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of viral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlights the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, S.; Laumaea, A.; Gasser, R.; Medjahed, H.; Pancera, M.; Stamatatos, L.; McGuire, A.; Bazin, R.; Finzi, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
89,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Africa reveals potentially clinically relevant mutations.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan province of the Hubei district in China and rapidly spread across the globe. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. Across the continents and specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel related. Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with sequences from COVID-19 hotspots (including China, Brazil, Italy, United State of America and the United Kingdom). To identify if there are distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to genomes from other countries, including disease hotspots, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase (NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible targets for vaccine coverage or potential therapeutic agents. Our results showed a similarity between the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes and genomes in countries including China, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and the United States of America. This study shows for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 landscape across Africa and will potentially provide insights into specific mutations to relevant proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in African populations.","Iweriebor, B.

90,In vitro study of BromAc on SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins shows synergy and disintegration at modest concentrations,"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. It is characterised by being highly contagious and nasal mucosa appears to be the primary site with subsequent spread to the lungs and elsewhere. BromAc (Bromelain & Acetylcysteine) has been described to disrupt glycoproteins by the synchronous breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulphide bonds. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target as it is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells and is formed of glycoprotein and disulphide bridges for stabilisation. Hence, we sought to determine whether BromAc has activity on the spike and envelope protein specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

DesignGel electrophoresis analysis was carried out on recombinant spike and envelope proteins that were treated with a range of concentrations of single agents and BromAc. For UV analysis of disulfide bonds reduction, both spike and envelope protein were treated with Acetylcysteine with the determination of loss of disulfide bonds.

ResultsRecombinant spike and envelope SARS-CoV-2 protein were fragmented by BromAc whilst single agents had minimal effect. Spike and envelope proteins disulphide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine.

ConclusionBromAc disintegrates the spike and envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2 and may render it non-infective. In vitro tests on live virus have been encouraging and clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent.","Akhter, J.; Pillai, K.; Badar, S.; Mekkawy, A.; Valle, S.; Morris, D.

91,Structural characterization of Nonstructural protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus and the etiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 [A]. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped {beta}-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein. Our results provide unparalleled insight into the molecular structure of a major pathogenic determinant of SARS-CoV-2.","Semper, C.; Watanabe, N.; Savchenko, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
92,Many bat species are not potential hosts of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Evidence from ACE2 receptor usage,"Bats are the suggested natural hosts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, the latter of which caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The interaction of viral Spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to show that ACE2 orthologs from 24, 21, and 16 of 46 phylogenetically diverse bat species - including those in close and distant contact with humans - do not support entry of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and both of these coronaviruses, respectively. Furthermore, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify genetic changes in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our study demonstrates that many - if not most - bat species are not potential hosts of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and provides important insights into pandemic control and wildlife conservation.","Yan, H.; Jiao, H.; Liu, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, X.; Guo, M.; Wang, B.-J.; Lan, K.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
93,Interaction of human ACE2 to membrane-bound SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins,"A novel severe acute respiratory (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, S. P.; Chen, Y.; Prevost, J.; Gasser, R.; Beaudoin-Bussieres, G.; Abrams, C.

94,Transmission of allosteric response within the homotrimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike upon recognition of ACE2 receptor by the receptor-binding domain,"The pathogenesis of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates through recognition of ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located at spikes of the virus. Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action of the trimer. Based on our results, we propose the allosteric loop of RBD as a potential drug target.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Bhattacharyya, R.; Sengupta, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,False
95,Mutational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in African Population,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious and pathogenic virus has claimed lot of lives globally since its outbreak in December 2019 posing dire threat on public health, global economy, social and human interaction. At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","Omotoso, O.

96,The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates early serine protease-mediated entry into organoid-derived human airway cells,"After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a second zoonotic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, emerged late 2019 in China and rapidly caused the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a public health crisis of an unprecedented scale. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target.

Significance StatementHighly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate fundamental knowledge to the clinic, a process that is expedited through the use of relevant cell culture systems.","Mykytyn, A.

In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model.","Basso, F. G.; de Paulo, A.

99,Notable sequence homology of the ORF10 protein introspects the architecture of SARS-COV-2,"The global public health is endangered due to COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having similar pathology to MERS and SARS-CoV, the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely lower than 1%. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be uniquely characterized by the accessory protein ORF10, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids length each, across various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes. In this study, all missense mutations found in sequence databases were examined across twnety-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants that could possibly alter viral pathogenicity. Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Hassan, S.
