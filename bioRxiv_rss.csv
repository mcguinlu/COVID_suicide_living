0,Universal PCR and antibody testing demonstrate little to no transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural community,"Background: The absence of systematic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 has curtailed accurate appraisal of transmission intensity. Our objective was to perform case detection of an entire rural community to quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission using PCR and antibody testing. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural town of Bolinas, California (population 1,620), four weeks following shelter-in-place orders. Residents and county essential workers were tested between April 20th-24th, 2020. Prevalence by PCR and seroprevalence combining data from two forms of antibody testing were performed in parallel (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG to nucleocapsid protein and in-house IgG ELISA to the receptor binding domain). Results: Of 1,891 participants, 1,312 were confirmed Bolinas residents (>80% community ascertainment). Zero participants were PCR positive. Assuming 80% sensitivity, it would have been unlikely to observe these results (p<0.05) if there were >3 active infections in the community. Based on antibody results, estimated prevalence of prior infection was 0.16% (95% CrI: 0.02%, 0.46%). Seroprevalence estimates using only one of the two tests would have been higher, with greater uncertainty. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive result on both tests was 99.11% (95% CrI: 95.75%, 99.94%), compared to PPV 44.19%-63.32% (95% CrI range 3.25%-98.64%) if only one test was utilized. Conclusions: Four weeks following shelter-in-place, active and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rural Northern California community was extremely rare. In this low prevalence setting, use of two antibody tests increased the PPV and precision of seroprevalence estimates.","Appa, A.; Takahashi, S.; Rodriguez-Barraquer, I.; Chamie, G.; Sawyer, A.; CLIAHUB Consortium,; Duarte, E.; Hakim, J.; Turcios, K.; Vinden, J.; Janson, O.; Manglik, A.; Peluso, M.

1,SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Correlate with Resolution of RNAemia But Are Short-Lived in Patients with Mild Illness,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, could offer protective immunity, and may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 625 serial plasma samples from 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 170 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.","RoÌˆltgen, K.; Wirz, O.

2,IL-6 and IL-10 as predictors of disease severity in COVID 19 patients: Results from Meta-analysis and Regression,"Objectives: SARS-CoV-2, an infectious agent behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, induces high levels of cytokines in patients contributing to the disease patho-physiology. Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of particular cytokines towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical management. Methods: Scientific literature was searched to identify 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN-{gamma} between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. Results: Out of the 6 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across the studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~ 92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates. Conclusions: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis.","Dhar, S.

3,Behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal products among the public in response to Covid-19 in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study,"The present study was conducted to assess the behavioral preventive measures and the use of medicines and herbal foods/products among the public in response to Covid-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 27 June to 20 July 2020, and 1222 people participated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify the differences in behavioral preventive practices across different demographic categories. To identify the factors associated with the use of preventive medicines and herbal foods/products, multivariable logistic regression was performed. Most participants adopted the recommended preventive practices such as washing hands more frequently (87.5%), staying home more often (85.5%), avoiding crowds (86%), and wearing masks (91.6%). About half of the smokers reported a decreased rate of smoking during the pandemic. Also, 14.8% and 57.6% of the participants took medicines and herbal foods/products as preventive measures against Covid-19. Arsenicum album and Zinc supplements were the most commonly used preventive medicines. Gender, age, and fear of Covid-19 were significantly associated with the use of both preventive medicines and herbal products. For the management of Covid-19 related symptoms, Paracetamols, Fexofenadine, and Zinc supplements were used most often. Most participants sought information from non-medical sources while using medicines and herbal products. Moreover, potentially inappropriate and unnecessary use of drugs were identified.","Ahmed, I.; Hasan, M.; Akter, R.; Sarkar, B. K.; Rahman, M.; Sarker, M. S.; Samad, M.

4,ESTIMATING PREVALENCE AND TIME COURSE OF SARS-CoV-2 BASED ON NEW HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND PCR TESTS,"Data posted in the COVID 19 tracking website for RT-PCR (PCR) results and hospital admissions are used to estimate the prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States (1). Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests due to their initially limited test numbers and application as a diagnostic, instead of a surveying tool. As of July 31, the United States' cumulative recovered population is estimated at 47% or 155 million. The remaining susceptible population is 53%, or 47% excepting the 6% infectious population. The estimated mortality rate of the cumulative recovered population is 0.09% death per case. New York and Massachusetts show SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 87% and 55%, respectively. Likewise, each state exhibits relatively low current positive PCR results at 1 % and 1.7%. Also, these states show about twice the mortality rate of the nation. Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered population percent around 40%, higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 7% to 13%. A higher recovered population mitigates the current positive value attainable by limiting the infectivity rate Re. This approach provides an alternate source of information on the pandemic's full time course since the serological testing only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease. The deficiency of serological testing to estimate the recovered population is made even more acute due to the large proportion of asymptomatic and sub-clinical cases in the COVID-19 pandemic","Gonzalez, J.

5,SARS-Coronavirus-2 nucleocapsid protein measured in blood using a Simoa ultra-sensitive immunoassay differentiates COVID-19 infection with high clinical sensitivity.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies and economies worldwide. Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum / plasma samples. The limit of detection (LoD) estimated by titration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus is 0.2 pg/ml, corresponding to 0.05 Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) per ml, > 2000 times more sensitive than current EUA approved antigen tests. No cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses, including hCoV229E, hCoVOC43, hCoVNL63, Influenza A or Influenza B, was observed. We detected elevated N-protein concentrations in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals using capillary blood from a finger-stick collection device. The Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay has the potential to detect COVID-19 infection via antigen in blood with similar or better performance characteristics of molecular tests, while also enabling at home and point of care sample collection.","Shan, D.; Johnson, J.

6,The differential immune responses to COVID-19 in peripheral and lung revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Understanding the mechanism that leads to immune dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV2 virus is crucial to develop treatment for severe COVID-19. Here, using single cell RNA-seq, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients, and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DC) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8+ T cell subsets, compared to health controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4+ T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2 and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients' peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4 and CCL5 etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the patients' lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19.","Xu, G.; Qi, F.; Li, H.; Yang, Q.; Wang, H.; Wang, X.; Liu, X.; Zhao, J.; Liao, X.; Liu, Y.; Amit, I.; Liu, L.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175638v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175638v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
7,A pilot study to see any Change of the Nasal and Oropharyngeal Microbiota with Prolonged Use of Medical Masks during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has played havoc on the healthcare system and society. Many international guidelines have put forward various measures to control the spread and, using various quality masks seems to be the most important amongst them. This was a cross-sectional pilot study to see any alterations in the bacterial flora of the nasal and the oropharyngeal (OP) microbiota with the use of medical masks over prolonged periods during this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected using proper international guidelines from 30 healthy healthcare workers matching pre-set inclusion criteria, who gave written informed consent. The swabs were used for gram stain as well as culture and sensitivity analysis using standard methods. Results: In general, we found that the oropharyngeal microflora harboured a more diverse population of bacteria (n=13) than the nasal microflora (n=5). The predominant bacterial flora was found to Staphylococcus epidermidis in the nasal cavity and Streptococcus viridans in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was no growth in 8 (26.68%) samples of oropharynx and 3 (10%) of nasal samples, with one patient having no growth in both the samples. The commonest resistant antibiotic from both the cavity cultures was benzylpenicillin (nasal flora 80% and OP flora 47.37%). Conclusion: This small pilot study has shown a reassuring aspect of no change in the typical bacterial microflora species of the nasal and OP cavity with prolonged use of medical masks. This is the first study to show this convincing evidence during the COVID-19 outbreak and also in healthy healthcare workers who have to wear masks over long durations.","Roy, S.; Majumder, P.; Bhattacharjee, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175067v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175067v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
8,Evaluation of commercially available immuno-magnetic agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for rapid point-of-care diagnostics of COVID-19,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Fast, accurate and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. Methods: The study included 35 plasma samples from 22 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA or IgG antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA)(ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM+IgA/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics, Denmark) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ((ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Germany). Results: Of the 35 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 29 (82.9%) were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples (82.9%) were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA+IgM and 73% IgG by IMA and 73% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 90%. Specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. Conclusion: IMA for COVID-19 is a rapid simple-to-use point of care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","Moeller, M. E.; Fock, J.; Pah, P.; Veras, A. D. L.

9,The influence of climate factors on COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia: An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model,"Background A unique concern pertaining to the spread of COVID-19 across countries is the asymmetry of risk and the irrational fear of a new pandemic and its possible serious consequences. This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example. Methodology/Principal Findings Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables. For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state, Conclusions/Significance The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the community.","Naing, C.; Ni, H.; Aung, H.

10,The effect of smoking on COVID-19 symptom severity: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2), and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019, but quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic. While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Non-severe cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors. Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P <.008). In 10.7% (978/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases. Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.","Gulsen, A.; Arpinar Yigitbas, B.; Uslu, B.; Droemann, D.; Kilinc, O.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20102699v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
11,Hydroxychloroquine Safety Outcome within Approved Therapeutic Protocol for COVID-19 Outpatients in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Healthcare systems globally has been challenged following the COVID-19 pandemic, since late 2019. Multiple approaches and strategies have been performed to relieve the pressure and support existing healthcare systems. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the National Healthcare System. Since the 5th of June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics were established across Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 2,733 eligible patients subjected to MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine and zinc) and revisited the clinics within 3-7 days after treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. The data was collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with that of the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network, HESN) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) Committee. Results: Majority of the cases were males (70.4%). Upon reassessing the studied participants within 3-7 days, 240 patients (8.8%) discontinued the treatment protocol because of the development of side effects (4.1%) and for non-clinical reasons in the remaining (4.7%). Medication side effects overall were reported among (6.7%) of all studied participants, including mainly cardiovascular adverse events (2.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (2.4%). No Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death were reported among these patients. Conclusion: In our study, results show that the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients in mild to moderate cases in an outpatient setting, within the protocol recommendation and inclusion/exclusion criteria, is safe, highly tolerable, and with minimum side effects.","Mohana, A.; Suliman, T.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; Alkhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; Almohaizeie, A.; AboGazalah, F.; AbdulKareem, K.; AlGhofaili, F.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175752v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.16.20175752v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True
12,Specific Dynamic Variations in the Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Subsets in COVID-19 and Severe Influenza A Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study,"Background: Both COVID-19 and influenza A contribute to increased mortality among the elderly and those with existing comorbidities. Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration. Methods: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). Results: We reviewed the patients' data of 110 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe COVID-19, 19 Severe COVID-19 and 43 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.93*109/L, 0.84*109/L vs 1.78*109/L, P < 0.0001) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of both severe patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1-4). Conclusions: Our study indicates lymphopenia to be associated with disease severity and suggests the plausible role of lymphocyte subsets in disease progression, which in turn affects prognosis and recovery duration in patients with severe COVID-19 and influenza A.","Zhang, F.; Qian, F.; Gao, G.; Song, Y.; Xu, Y.; Wang, A.; Wang, S.; Hao, Y.; Chen, M.; Ma, X.; Zhao, T.; Guo, X.; Chen, Z.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175455v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175455v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,True

15,"Rapid, sensitive and high-throughput screening method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by bio layer interferometry","Present pandemic scenario, there exists an unmet global need for the development of a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available options for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection are detection of viral RNA by qRT-PCR, Antigen or Antibody testing by serological methods. Even though many kits available commercially but none of them are rapid, sensitive and high throughput. OnCovid total antibody assay is a diagnostic method developed by us uses the principle of bio-layer Interferometry to detect IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This method overcomes many of the limitations normally faced in antibody detection by other methods and offers a superior platform for a rapid, sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test is economical, and the results can be obtained in as short as 30 seconds per test. In addition to its standalone use in early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, OnCovid total antibody assay can be used to therapeutic monitoring of antiviral therapies used in clinical management and to estimate the antibody titers during convalescent plasma donation.","Lokireddy, S.

16,GIS-based spatial modeling to identify factors affecting COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented shock throughout the world which leads to generate a massive social, human, and economic crisis. However, there is a lack of research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R square value of 78.6%. Findings from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation and would help to develop policies aimed to prevent the future epidemic crisis.","Rahman, M. H.; Zafri, N. M.; Ashik, F.

17,COVID-19 TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS IN INDIA WITH EXTENDED SEIR MODEL,"India is one of the most harshly affected countries due to COVID epidemic. Early implementation of lockdown protocols were useful to control certain parameters of transmission dynamics, but the numbers are consistently increasing in later months. India population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.","MALI REDDY, B.

18,"Impact of COVID-19 on Primary Care Mental Health Services: A Descriptive, Cross-Sectional Timeseries of Electronic Healthcare Records","Introduction. There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","Bauer-Staeb, C. M. M.; Davis, A.; Smith, T.

19,The basic reproduction number can be accurately estimated within 14 days after societal lockdown: The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark,"Objective: Early identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020. Conclusion: We believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.","Valentin, J.

20,Rates of COVID-19-related Outcomes in Cancer compared to non-Cancer Patients,"Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, healthcare exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer. These results emphasize the critical importance of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and mitigating infection in cancer patients.","Sun, L.; Sanjna, S.; Le, A.; Desai, H.; Doucette, A.; Gabriel, P.; Ritchie, M.; Rader, D.; Maillard, I.; Bange, E.; Huang, A.; Vonderheide, R.

22,"Detection, prevalence, and duration of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 under conditions of limited population exposure.","We conducted an extensive serological study to quantify population-level exposure and define correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We found that relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated authentic virus-neutralizing titers and antibody levels against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 region of spike protein. Unlike disease severity, age and sex played lesser roles in serological responses. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. RBD- and S2-specific and neutralizing antibody titers remained elevated and stable for at least 2-3 months post-onset, whereas those against N were more variable with rapid declines in many samples. Testing of 5882 self-recruited members of the local community demonstrated that 1.24% of individuals showed antibody reactivity to RBD. However, 18% (13/73) of these putative seropositive samples failed to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Each of the neutralizing, but only 1 of the non-neutralizing samples, also displayed potent reactivity to S2. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays markedly improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the viral antigen. In contrast to other reports, we conclude that immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ripperger, T. J.; Uhrlaub, J.

23,"Design of a highly thermotolerant, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment","Virtually all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in clinical testing are stored in a refrigerated or frozen state prior to use. This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Several use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these novel, nucleic acid based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 200mg/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100{degrees}C when lyophilized, and upto 70{degrees}C in solution. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59 like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.","Malladi, S.

26,Assessment of physiological signs associated with COVID-19 measured using wearable devices,"Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices and which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore, mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced, age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and 0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis, and in monitoring the progress of the disease.","Natarajan, A.; Su, H.-W.; Heneghan, C.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175265v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175265v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True
27,Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Mutations on Protein Structures and Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions,"Since 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected ten millions of people across the globe, and massive mutations in virus genome have occurred during the rapid spread of this novel coronavirus. Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 18 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all [&ge;]1% as of July 15th, 2020, then modeled the mutated protein structures and compared them with the reference ones. The results showed that four types of mutations could cause dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD [&ge;]5.0 [A]), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations could affect the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-Orf8 and Orf3a-S protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries. Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations can change viral protein structure, binding affinity and hot spots of the interface, thereby may have impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Wu, S.; Tian, C.; Liu, P.; Guo, D.; Zheng, W.; Huang, X.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, L.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.15.241349v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,False
28,High titers of multiple antibody isotypes against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and nucleoprotein associate with better neutralization.,"Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.","Noval, M.

29,Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.","Meekins, D.

Methods We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N=54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). We proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified, as suggested by WHO guidelines. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. Results We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. Conclusion Contact tracing is instrumental to contain infectious diseases and its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will have a substantial impact on reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","Vecino-Ortiz, A. I.; Villanueva Congote, J.; Zapata Bedoya, S.; Cucunuba, Z.

32,"Knowledge, Practice and associated factors towards the Prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups: A cross-sectional study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease-19 is a highly transmittable virus that continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low-income segments of society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in-person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","DEFAR, A.; Molla, G.; Abdella, S.; Tessema, M.; Ahmed, M.; Tadele, A.; Getachew, F.; Hailegiorgis, B.; Tigabu, E.; Ababor, S.; Bizuwork, K.; Deressa, A.; Tasew, G.; kebede, A.; Melese, D.; Gashu, A.; Eshetu, K.; Tayachew, A.; Wossen, M.; Hassen, A.; Habebe, S.; Assefa, Z.; Abayneh, A.; Abate, E.; Tollera, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20172429v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20172429v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True
33,"Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: a study of 62,354 COVID-19 cases","Background: Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. Methods: We addressed both questions using cohort studies derived from an electronic health records (EHR) network of 69 million patients including over 62,000 cases of COVID-19. Propensity score matching was used to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for more severe illness. Findings: In patients with no prior psychiatric history, COVID-19 was associated with an increased incidence of psychiatric diagnoses in the three months after infection compared to 6 other health events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 2.1 [1.8-2.5] compared to influenza; 1.7 [1.5-1.9] compared to other respiratory tract infections; 1.6 [1.4-1.9] compared to skin infection; 1.6 [1.3.1-9] compared to cholelithiasis; 2.2 [1.9-2.6] compared to urolithiasis, and 2.1 [1.9-2.5] compared to fracture of a large bone; all p<0.0001). The increase was greatest for anxiety disorders but also present for depression, insomnia, and dementia. The results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. There was a ~30% reduction in psychiatric diagnoses in the total EHR population over the same period. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a 65% higher incidence of COVID-19 (relative risk 1.65, 95% CI: 1.59-1.71, p<0.0001). This was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19. Interpretation: COVID-19 infection has both psychiatric sequelae and psychiatric antecedents. Survivors have an increased rate of new onset psychiatric disorders, and prior psychiatric disorders are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. The findings have implications for research into aetiology and highlight the need for clinical services to provide multidisciplinary follow-up, and prompt detection and treatment.","Taquet, M.; Luciano, S.; Geddes, J.

34,"Widespread testing, case isolation and contact tracing may allow safe school reopening with continued moderate physical distancing: a modeling analysis of King County, WA data","Background In late March 2020, a ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy"" order was issued in Washington State in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, a 4-phase reopening plan began. If implemented without interruptions, all types of public interactions were planned to resume by July 15. We investigated whether adjunctive prevention strategies would allow less restrictive physical distancing to avoid second epidemic waves and secure safe school reopening. Methods We developed a mathematical model, stratifying the population by age (0-19 years, 20-49 years, 50-69 years, and 70+ years), infection status (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, recovered) and treatment status (undiagnosed, diagnosed, hospitalized) to project SARS-CoV-2 transmission during and after the reopening period. The model was parameterized with demographic and contact data from King County, WA and calibrated to confirmed cases, deaths (overall and by age) and epidemic peak timing. Adjunctive prevention interventions were simulated assuming different levels of pre-COVID physical interactions (pC_PI) restored. We made several predictions related to adjunctive interventions or increased pC_PI. Results The best model fit estimated ~35% pC_PI under lockdown. Gradually restoring 75% pC_PI for all age groups between May 15-July 15 resulted in ~350 daily deaths by early September 2020. Maintaining less than 45% pC_PI was required with current testing practices to ensure low levels of daily infections and deaths. If widespread community transmission persisted, isolating the elderly does not lower daily death rates significantly. Increased testing, isolation of symptomatic infections, and contact tracing permitted 60% pC_PI without significant increases in daily deaths before September, although this strategy may not be sufficient to eliminate community transmission. This combination strategy also allowed opening of schools with <15 daily deaths. Inpatient antiviral treatment reduces deaths significantly without lowering cases or hospitalizations. Conclusions We predict that widespread implementation of ""test and isolate"" policy alone is insufficient to prevent the rapid re-emergence of SARS CoV-2 without moderate physical distancing. However, widespread testing, contact tracing and case isolation would allow relaxation of physical distancing, as well as opening of schools, without a surge in local cases and deaths.","Bracis, C.; Burns, E.; Moore, M.; Swan, D.; Reeves, D.

35,"Robust, reproducible clinical patterns in hospitalised patients with COVID-19","Severe COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, and dyspnoea. Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","Millar, J.

36,The limits of estimating COVID-19 intervention effects using Bayesian models,"To limit the rapid spread of COVID-19, most governments have introduced different non-pharmaceutical interventions, which might have severe costs for society. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the most cost-effective interventions, using, for instance, Bayesian modelling. Such modelling efforts have deemed lockdown to account for 81% of the reduction in R0, contributing to government policies. Here, we show that these conclusions are unsupported and that policies therefore should not be based on these studies.","Bryant, P.; Elofsson, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175240v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20175240v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True

While this suggests a conflict between health protection and economic objectives, we examine whether the economically optimal exit strategy can be reconciled with the containment of the epidemic. We use a novel combination of epidemiological and economic simulations for scenario calculations based on empirical evidence from Germany. Our findings suggest that a prudent opening is economically optimal, whereas costs are higher for a more extensive opening process. This rejects the view that there is a conflict with health protection. Instead, it is in the common interest of public health and the economy to relax non-pharmaceutical interventions in a manner that keeps the epidemic under control.","Dorn, F.; Khailaie, S.; Stoeckli, M.; Binder, S.

38,Estimating the epidemic growth dynamics within the first week,"Information about the early growth of infectious outbreaks are indispensable to estimate the epidemic spreading. A large number of mathematical tools have been developed to this end, facing as much large number of different dynamic evolutions, ranging from sub-linear to super-exponential growth. Of course, the crucial point is that we do not have enough data during the initial outbreak phase to make reliable inferences. Here we propose a methodology to estimate the epidemic growth dynamics from the infected cumulative data of just a week, provided a surveillance system is available over the whole territory. The methodology, based on the Newcomb-Benford Law, is applied to Italian covid 19 case-study. Results show that it is possible to discriminate the epidemic dynamics using the first seven data points collected over fifty Italian cities. Moreover, the form of the most probable approximating function of the growth, within a six weeks epidemic scenario, is identified.","FIORITI, V.; ROSELLI, I.; CHINNICI, M.; ARBORE, A.; SIGISMONDI, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20170878v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20170878v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True
39,"Socio-demographic, clinical, hospital admission and oxygen requirement characteristics of COVID-19 patients of Bangladesh",Abstract Background: Clinical presentation hospital admission and outcome of COVID-19 pandemic are different from one country to another. So every country should have their own data regarding COVID-19. Subjects and Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey carried out in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 adult patient. A preformed questionnaire adapted in Google form and circulated through online to collect data. Informed consent was ensured before participation in this study. Results: We have studied of 305 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients mean age was 36.32(+/-12.369) years with male predominance and majority were doctor 46.9%. 48.8% of the patients family members affected along with them. After COVID-19 pandemic 31.7% did not go out of their house. For prevention (72.4%)of the patients used mask and 38.8% used hand gloves during outing. 28.7% reported to be affected while working in hospital 21.8%were affected in their office. Fever (80.1%) cough (57.7%) pain in throat (50.8%) rhinitis (45.9%) and loss of smell (45%) and taste sensation (45.6%) were the most common symptoms. Sample was given average 3 (+/- 3.384) days after onset of the symptoms and report was delivered average 4.57 days after giving sample. After getting result 32.1% of the patients seek treatment in telemedicine and 23% directly consulted in Government hospital only 2% reported to be treated by the Government designated telephone number. 73.1% of the patient took both steam inhalation and warm water gargling. Paracetamol and antihistamine was the most commonly use drugs 69.8% and 71.5% respectively besides 47.5% took ivermectin 41.6% took azithromycin 35.1% steroid 34.8% took doxycyclin and 21.6% hydroxychloroquine. Among the patients only 20.3% needed hospital admission. The patients admitted in hospital average 5 (+/-3.922) days after onset of symptoms and hospital staying was 9.2 days (average). Breathless (54.83%) was the major cause of hospital admission and 19.35% patients admitted due to fear. 14% patients needed oxygen and average duration of oxygen was 4.84 days. 81.3% patients has taken oxygen in hospital and 18.8% at their home. Among the patient 2.2% needed ICU and artificial ventilation needed for 1.1% patients. The patients recovered after 17.74 days (average) from the onset of symptom. COVID-19 became negative (RT-PCR) at15th day from onset of symptom. 91.8%) were in mental stress to become the cause of infection spread to other family members 20.7%) reported that they were anxious that they would not get oxygen or ICU if required and 27.9% were suffering from fear of death. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom in 57.4% cases. Average time required for coming back to normal life was 21.59 days (+/-7.901) ranging a wide range from 5 to 60 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients were mostly male health worker. Fever cough pain in throat were most common symptoms. Hospital admission required in only one-fifth cases and ICU required for only 2% patients. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom.

A better understanding of symptoms, comorbidities and medication used for pre-existing conditions in patients with COVID-19 could help healthcare workers identify patients at increased risk of developing more severe disease. Here, we have used self-reported data (symptoms, medications and comorbidities) from more than 3 million users from the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app12 to identify previously reported and novel features predictive of patients being admitted in a hospital setting. Despite previously reported association between age and more severe disease phenotypes, we found that patient's age, sex and ethnic group were minimally predictive when compared to patient's symptoms and comorbidities. The most important variables selected by our predictive algorithm were fever, the use of immunosuppressant medication, mobility aid, shortness of breath and fatigue. It is anticipated that early administration of preventative measures in COVID-19 positive patients (COVID+) who exhibit a high risk of hospitalization signature may prevent severe disease progression.","Huang, Y.; Radenkovic, D.; Perez, K.; Nadeau, K.; Verdin, E.; Furman, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20170365v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20170365v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True

We find that a vaccine with effectiveness [&ge;]50% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age-groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age-groups first for high vaccination coverage.

42,Superspreading as a Regular Factor of the COVID-19 Pandemic: II. Quarantine Measures and the Second Wave,"Within the framework of a two-component model of the COVID-19 epidemic, taking into account the special role of superspreaders, we consider the impact of the recovery factor and quarantine measures on the course of the epidemic, as well as the possibility of a second wave of morbidity. It is assumed that there is no long-term immunity in asymptomatic superspreaders who have under- gone the infection, and the emergence of long-term immunity in those who have undergone severe illness. It is shown that, under these assumptions, the relaxation of quarantine measures leads to the resumption of virus circulation among asymptomatic superspreaders. Depending on the charac- teristics of the quarantine, its removal may or may not lead to a renewed wave of daily morbidity. A criterion for the occurrence of repeated wave of morbidity is proposed based on the analysis of the final phase of the first wave. Based on this criterion, the repeated wave of the epidemic is predicted in New Zealand. A natural explanation is given for the decrease in lethality among the infected against the background of an absolute increase in their number.","Dimaschko, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174557v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174557v1?rss=1,2020-08-16,2020-08-16,,True
43,The Effect of Neutropenia and Filgrastim (G-CSF) in Cancer Patients With COVID-19 Infection,"Background: Neutropenia is commonly encountered in cancer patients, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is widely given to oncology patients to counteract neutropenia and prevent infection. G-CSF is both a growth factor and cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients, who are also afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains unknown. Methods: An observational cohort of 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia (N=55) and G-CSF administration (N=16) on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were assessed as time-dependent predictors using an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, a similar model was constructed with patients that received G-CSF, categorized into high- and low-response, based on the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rise 24 hours after growth factor administration. Results: Neutropenia (ANC < 1 K/mcL) during COVID-19 course was not independently associated with severe respiratory failure or death (HR: 0.71, 95% Cl: 0.34-1.50, P value: 0.367) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. When controlling for neutropenia, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06-8.28, P value: 0.038). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.61-16.64, P value: 0.006). Conclusion: Possible risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be weighed in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, as G-CSF may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status in this setting.","Morjaria, S.; Zhang, A.; Kaltsas MD, A.; Parameswaran, R.; Patel, D.; Zhou, W.; Predmore, J.; Perez Johnston, R.; Jee, J.; Perales, M.; Daniyan, A.; Taur, Y.; Mailankody, S.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174565v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174565v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
44,In plain sight: the role of alpha-1-antitrypsin in COVID-19 pathogenesis and therapeutics.,"Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases. These proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naive serum exhibits significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and to a lesser degree, alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) as highly abundant serum protease inhibitors that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2. AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT mutations that have been characterized to affect abundance or function are highly prevalent. In addition to the effects that AAT may have on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even potentially AAT therapy.","Oguntuyo, K.

Here, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based high-throughput screening platform to screen compound libraries to identify drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), in particular those which are FDA-approved, to be used immediately to treat patients with COVID-19. Mpro has been shown to be one of the most important drug targets among SARS-related coronaviruses as impairment of Mpro blocks processing of viral polyproteins which halts viral replication in host cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine (TFQ) induces significant conformational change in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and diminishes its protease activity. Specifically, TFQ reduces the alpha-helical content of Mpro, which converts it into an inactive form. Moreover, TFQ greatly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture system. Hence, the current study provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of action of TFQ against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Moreover, the low clinical toxicity of TFQ and its strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 should warrant further testing in clinical trials.","Chen, Y.; Yang, W.-H.; Huang, L.-M.; Wang, Y.-C.; Yang, C.-S.; Liu, Y.-L.; Hou, M.-H.; Tsai, C.-L.; Chou, Y.-Z.; Huang, B.-Y.; Hung, C.-F.; Hung, Y.-L.; Chen, J.-S.; Chiang, Y.-P.; Cho, D.-Y.; Jeng, L.-B.; Tsai, C.-H.; Hung, M.-C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.250258v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.250258v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,False
46,Mortality Associated With Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19,"Objective: The need for critical care, hemodynamic support, renal replacement therapy, and mechanical ventilation have emerged as key features of the SARS-nCoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim of this study was to determine the in-hospital mortality rate of mechanically ventilated patients. We also sought to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and body mass index. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the mortality rate among inpatient adults with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation in the Nuvance Health system between March 1, 2020 and July 17, 2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older, had a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were admitted to hospitals within the Nuvance Health network (7 hospitals), and were on mechanical ventilation at any time during their inpatient stay. Results: Overall mortality in our cohort of 304 patients was 53.3 percent. Multivariable logistic regression including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and BMI demonstrated patients over 71 years old had greater risk of mortality compared to patients ages 61-70, and females had half the risk compared to males. There was no significant difference in risk of mortality given race, ethnicity, or BMI. Conclusions: In adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care, advanced age (>71 years old) and male gender are associated with increased risk of mortality. This information contributes to a collective body of evidence to support ongoing planning and decision-making among clinicians and for directed infection prevention programming.","Zimmerman, P.; Stroever, S.; Burton, T.; Hester, K.; Kim, M.; Fahy, R.; Corbitt, K.; Petrini, J.; Nicastro, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174524v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174524v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
47,Sixty-day mortality among 520 Italian hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted ventilatory strategy in the context of an integrated multidisciplinary clinical organization: a population-based cohort study,"Background: Among COVID-19 patients, the decision of which ventilation strategy to adopt is crucial and not guided by existing outcome evidence. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted respiratory strategy. Methods: Population-based cohort study including all COVID-19 patients (26/02/2020-18/04/2020) within Rimini Italian province. Hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (group Oxygen), NIV (group NIV-only), IMV (group IMV-only), and IMV after a NIV trial (group IMV-after-NIV). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab. Findings: We identified 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, the remaining 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-days death. According to the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to Oxygen, 46 (8.8%) to NIV-only, 25 (4.8%) to IMV-after-NIV, and 41 (7.9%) to IMV-only groups. There was no significant difference in the P/F at IMV inception among IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p = 0.165). Compared with Oxygen group, the 60-day mortality risk significantly increased for IMV-after-NIV (HR 2.776; p=0.024) and IMV-only group (HR 2.966; p=0.001). Conclusions: This study provides a population-based figure of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. A similar 60-days mortality risk was found for patients undergoing immediate IMV and those intubated after a NIV trial. Many patients had a favorable outcome after prolonged IMV.","Potalivo, A.; Montomoli, J.; Facondini, F.; Sanson, G.; Lazzari Agli, L.

48,Forecasting United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Through Machine Learning,"COVID-19 has become a great national security problem for the United States and many other countries, where public policy and healthcare decisions are based on the several models for the prediction of the future deaths and cases of COVID-19. While the most commonly used models for COVID-19 include epidemiological models and Gaussian curve-fitting models, recent literature has indicated that these models could be improved by incorporating machine learning. However, within this research on potential machine learning models for COVID-19 forecasting, there has been a large emphasis on providing an array of different types of machine learning models rather than optimizing a single one. In this research, we suggest and optimize a linear machine learning model with a gradient-based optimizer for the prediction of future COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States. We also suggest that a hybrid of a machine learning model for shorter range predictions and a Gaussian curve-fitting model or an epidemiological model for longer range predictions could greatly increase the accuracy of COVID-19 forecasting.","Somalwar, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
49,Outcomes of Persons With COVID-19 in Hospitals With and Without Standard Treatment With (Hydroxy)chloroquine,"Objective To compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Methods We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. Results Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model. Conclusions After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.","Peters, E. J.; Collard, D.; van Assen, S.; Beudel, M.; Bomers, M.

50,Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Southwest Ethiopia.,"Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals which can affect people physically and psychologically. The older people and those with underlying medical problems are more likely to develop serious illness and death. Objective the aim of this study was to determine Covid-19 related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in Bench-Sheko,West Omo and Keffa Zones, southwest Ethiopia Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied among 613 adults with chronic disease. A simple sampling technique was applied. Correlational analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19 related stress score and coping strategy types. To measure the strength of association between dependent variables and independent variables and Pearson coefficients (r) with 95% Confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Finally, the variable, which shows statistical significance (p-value < 0.05 cut point) were used to quantify the associations among variables. Results: Around 613 participants of 96% response rate were participated. About 68.4% were moderately stressed; low stress was 17.8% and severe stress was 13.9 %. Covid-19 related perceived stress score were positively associated with coping strategies types of like sell-distraction, active coping, denial, emotional support, behavioral disengagement, venting, and use of instrument, positive reframing, self-blaming, planning, humoring and religion. The most preferable types of coping strategies were religious, instrumental and active coping strategies and while the least used were substance used. Conclusion: Significant numbers of participants were suffered from severe perceived stress due to covid-19 outbreak in this study area. Both adaptive and maladaptive Coping strategy types were significantly associated with stress. Substance use and self-blaming were the types coping strategies which were not associated with perceived stress.","Girma, A.; Ayalew, E.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174318v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174318v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
51,Pre-COVID-19 humoral immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2,"It is currently unknown whether acquired immunity to common alpha- and beta-coronaviruses provides cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that certain patient sera and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) collected prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike, S2 domain, and nucleoprotein. However, their presence did not translate into neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Importantly, we detected serum IgG reactivity to common coronaviruses in the early sera of patients with severe COVID-19 before the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Collectively, the results of our study indicate that pre-existing immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Miyara, M.; Sterlin, D.; Anna, F.; Marot, S.; Mathian, A.; Atif, M.; Quentric, P.; Mohr, A.; Claer, L.; Dorgham, K.; Parizot, C.; Yssel, H.; Chazal, T.; Fadlallah, J.; Haroche, J.; Benameur, N.; Boutolleau, D.; Burrel, S.; Mudumba, S.; Hockett, R.; Genalyte, C.; Charneau, P.; Calvez, V.; Marcelin, A.-G.; Amoura, Z.; Gorochov, G.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20173393v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20173393v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True

However there are reports that some people continue to experience symptoms even beyond the stage of acute infection. This phenomenon has been called longcovid. Study design: This study attempted to analyse symptoms reported by users on twitter self-identifying as longcovid. Methods: The search was carried out using the twitter public streaming application programming interface using a relevant search term. Results: We could identify 89 users with usable data in the tweets posted by them. A majority of users described multiple symptoms the most common of which were fatigue, shortness of breath, pain and brainfog/concentration difficulties. The most common course of symptoms was episodic. Conclusions: Given the public health importance of this issue, the study suggests that there is a need to better study post acute-COVID symptoms.","Singh, S.

53,Abusers indoors and coronavirus outside: an examination of public discourse about COVID-19 and family violence on Twitter using machine learning,"Purpose: This brief report aims to provide the first large-scale analysis of public discourse regarding family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. Method: We analyzed 301,606 Tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020, for this study. We used the machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and identified salient themes, topics, and representative Twitter examples. Results: We extracted nine themes on family violence and COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the Impact of COVID-19 on family violence (e.g., rising rates, hotline calls increased, murder & homicide); (2) the types (e.g., child abuse, domestic violence, sexual violence) and (3) forms of family violence (e.g., physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors of family violence (e.g., alcohol abuse, financial constraints, gun, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (e.g., LGBTQ, women, and women of color, children); (6) social services of family violence (e.g., hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (e.g., 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) Social movement/ awareness (e.g., support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (e.g., Tara Reade, Melissa Derosa). Conclusions: The COVID-19 has an impact on family violence. This report overcomes the limitation of existing scholarship that lacks data for consequences of COVID-19 on family violence. We contribute to the understanding of family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance in Tweets, which is essential to identify potentially effective policy programs in offering targeted support for victims and survivors and preparing for the next wave.","Xue, J.; Chen, J.; Chen, C.; Hu, R.; Zhu, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20167452v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20167452v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
54,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research: an ad hoc survey among investigators in Germany,"Objectives: To gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research projects, using projects from a selected funding programme in Germany as an example. Design: Online survey Setting: Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact upon clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data is often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care and crisis response. Participants: 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020. Results: The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as planned (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted upon health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve long-term resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example by accelerating the use of digital methods.","Bratan, T.; Aichinger, H.; Brkic, N.; Rueter, J.; Apfelbacher, C.; Loss, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174888v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.20174888v1?rss=1,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,,True
55,Modelling Suggests Limited Change in the Reproduction Number from Reopening Norwegian Kindergartens and Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: To suppress the COVID-19 outbreak, the Norwegian government closed all schools on March 13, 2020. The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. Methods: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsoe, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Results: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what Ferguson et al. have previously estimated for influenza pandemics [1]. Conclusion: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have not opened schools yet, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Rypdal, M.; Rypdal, V.

England implemented a delayed lockdown on March 23, 2020, but Sweden did not. We aim to examine the effect of lockdown on daily COVID-19 cases and related deaths during the first 100 days post-lockdown. Methods: We compared daily cases of COVID-19 infection and related mortality in England and Sweden before and after lockdown intervention using a comparative-interrupted time series analysis. The period included was from COVID-19 pandemic onset till June 30, 2020. Results: The adjusted-rate of daily COVID-19 infections was eight cases/10,000,000 person higher in England than Sweden before lockdown order (95% CI: 2-14, P=0.01). On the day of intervention (lagged lockdown), England had 693 more COVID-19 cases/10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 467-920, P<0.001). Compared to the pre-intervention period, the adjusted daily confirmed cases rate decreased by 19 cases/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 13-26, P<0.001). There was a rate excess of 1.5 daily deaths/ 10,000,000 person in England compared to Sweden pre-intervention (95% CI: 1-2, P<0.001). The increased mortality rate resulted in 50 excess deaths/ 10,000,000 person related to COVID-19 in England compared to Sweden on the day of lockdown (95% CI: 30-71, P<0.001). Post-intervention, the rate of daily deaths in England decreased by two deaths/ 10,000,000 person compared to Sweden (95% CI: 1-3, P<0.001). During phases one and two of lockdown lifting in England, there was no rebound increase in daily cases or deaths compared to Sweden. Conclusion: The lockdown order implemented in England on March 23, 2020, effectively decreased the daily new cases rate and related mortality compared to Sweden. There was no short-term increase in COVID-19 cases and related-deaths after the phases one and two of the lifting of restrictions in England compared to Sweden.

57,Stethoscope and Non-Infrared Thermometer Disinfection among Physicians: A Cross-Sectional Study with Implications for the Control of COVID-19,"Background: Stethoscopes and non infrared thermometers are the customary medical equipment used by the physicians on a daily basis, among various patients. With the rise of potential infections in the healthcare facilities and the transmission nature of the current volantly evolving COVID 19, consistent and correct disinfections of these devices after each use should not be pardoned. This study, therefore, describes the level of stethoscope and non infrared thermometer disinfection practices among physicians and determines its associated factors during the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire via Google form with a consent form appended to it. Results: Four hundred twenty-two physicians participated (62.80% medical doctors, 33.65% seniors, and 3.55% residents). The proportion of stethoscope and non Infrared thermometer disinfections after every use was 13.9% (95%CI: 10.9-17.6) and 20.4% (95%CI: 16.7-24.5), respectively. In adjusted analyses, taking COVID-19 training (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.52; 95% [Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.29-4.92) and the availability of stethoscope disinfection materials at the workplace (AOR: 3.03; 95% CI: 1.29-7.10) were significantly increased the odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use. The odds of stethoscope disinfection after every use was significantly decreased for those who reported the use of shared stethoscope (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.92). Among the physicians, disinfection after every use was significantly higher in resident physicians compared to those of general practitioners for both stethoscope (AOR: 4.61; 95%CI: 1.29-16.52) and non Infrared thermometers (AOR: 7.10; 95%CI: 2.30-21.95). Conclusion: Only a wee share of the respondents reported that they have disinfected their stethoscopes and non-infrared thermometers after every use possibly jeopardizing both patients and clinicians safety, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic and these results must be sternly dealt with. Provisions of training and securing constant and available stethoscope disinfection supplies can significantly increase disinfection practices among the physicians after every use. These simple interventions could be replicated by other healthcare facilities.","Sahiledengle, B.; Tekalegn, Y.; Bekele, K.; Tesemma, A.; Edward Quisido, B.

It is theoretically proved that the basic reproduction number is a nonlinear combination of parameters regarding disease transmission, intervention and economy effect, which totally determines the stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Further results indicate the existence of interaction and mutual restraint among the transmission, intervention and economy, in which strong coupling of COVID-19 and economy would trigger disease outbreak and form poverty trap, while adaptive isolation of at-risk population could effectively reduce morbidity at the cost of least economic loss.

In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues. These findings revealed a novel mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and could provide a new target to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wei, C.; Wan, L.; Yan, Q.; Wang, X.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, J.; Yang, X.; Gong, J.; Fan, C.; Yang, X.; Wang, Y.; Wang, X.; Li, J.; Yang, H.; Li, H.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, R.; Du, P.; Zong, Y.; Yin, F.; Zhang, W.; Peng, Y.; Lin, H.; Zhang, R.; Chen, W.; Gao, Q.; Cao, Y.; Zhong, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248872v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248872v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
60,Methylation of RNA Cap in SARS-CoV-2 captured by serial crystallography,"The genome of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contains 29 proteins, of which 15 are nonstructural. Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5' terminus. In the methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.","Wilamowski, M.; Sherrell, D.; Minasova, G.; Kim, Y.; Shuvaloca, L.; Lavens, A.; Chard, R.; Maltseva, N.; Jedrzejczak, R.; Rosas-Lemus, M.; Saint, N.; Foster, I.

61,Pandemic danger to the deep: the risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater,"We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. Many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we highlight the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","Mathavarajah, S.; Stoddart, A.

62,Differential methylation as a mediator of COVID-19 susceptibility,"The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.","Steyaert, S.; Trooskens, G.; Delanghe, J.

63,Extensive Genetic Diversity and Host Range of Rodent-borne Coronaviruses,"To better understand the genetic diversity, host association and evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) in China we analyzed a total of 696 rodents encompassing 16 different species sampled from Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. Based on the reverse transcriptase PCR-based CoV screening CoVs of fecal samples and subsequent sequence analysis of the RdRp gene, we identified CoVs in diverse rodent species, comprising Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus latronum, Bandicota indica, Eothenomys miletus, E. eleusis, Rattus andamanesis, Rattus norvegicus, and R. tanezumi. Apodemus chevrieri was a particularly rich host, harboring 25 rodent CoVs. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three groups of CoVs carried by a range of rodents that were closely related to the Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV_HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) identified previously. One newly identified A. chevrieri-associated virus closely related to LRNV lacked an NS2 gene. This virus had a similar genetic organization to AcCoV-JC34, recently discovered in the same rodent species in Yunnan, suggesting that it represents a new viral subtype. Notably, additional variants of LRNV were identified that contained putative nonstructural NS2b genes located downstream of the NS2 gene that were likely derived from the host genome. Recombination events were also identified in the ORF1a gene of Lijiang-71. In sum, these data reveal the substantial genetic diversity and genomic complexity of rodent-borne CoVs, and greatly extend our knowledge of these major wildlife virus reservoirs.","Wang, W.; Lin, X.-D.; Zhang, H.-L.; Wang, M.-R.; Guan, X.-Q.; Holmes, E.

64,In Silico Design of siRNAs Targeting Existing and Future Respiratory Viruses with VirusSi,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed global inadequacies in therapeutic options against both the COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus and other newly emerged respiratory viruses. In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","Zhang, D.; Lu, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.250076v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies.

66,Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","Papa, G.; Mallery, D.; Albecka, A.; Welch, L.; Cattin-Ortola, J.; Luptak, J.; Paul, D.; McMahon, H.; Goodfellow, I.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases.

69,"Ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells: rapid induction, prolonged contraction, and formation of functional memory","CD8+ T cells are critical for the elimination and long-lasting protection of many viral infections, but their role in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unclear. Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Schulien, I.; Kemming, J.; Oberhardt, V.; Wild, K.; Seidel, L.

70,Rational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins To Increase Immunogenicity By T Cell Epitope Engineering,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S proteins immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the proteins native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigens structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","Ong, E.; Huang, X.; Pearce, R.; Zhang, Y.; He, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.251496v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

72,Tissue-resident memory CD8 T-cell responses elicited by a single injection of a multi-target COVID-19 vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which enters the body principally through the nasal and larynx mucosa and progress to the lungs through the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.

Statement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","Gauttier, V.; Morello, A.; Girault, I.; Mary, C.; Belarif, L.; Desselle, A.; Wilhelm, E.; Bourquard, T.; Pengam, S.; Teppaz, G.; Thepenier, V.; Biteau, K.; De Barbeyrac, E.; Kiepferle, D.; Vasseur, B.; Le Flem, F.-X.; Debieuvre, D.; Costantini, D.; Poirier, N.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.14.240093v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False
73,Hydroxychloroquine: mechanism of action inhibiting SARS-CoV2 entry.,"BackgroundSARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic. Potential drugs identified for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the anesthetic propofol. Their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. Recently, anesthetics, both general and local, were shown to disrupt ordered lipid domains. These same lipid domains recruit the SARS-CoV-2 surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to an endocytic entry point and their disruption by cholesterol depletion decreases ACE2 recruitment and viral entry.

MethodsViral entry was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) and a luciferase reporter gene expressed by the virus after treatment of the cells with 50 M propofol, tetracaine, HCQ, and erythromycin. HCQ disruption of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1 (GM1) lipid rafts, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) domains, and ACE2 receptor at nanoscale distances was monitored by direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then labeled with either fluorescent cholera toxin B (CTxB) or antibody and then fixed again prior to imaging. Cluster analysis of dSTORM images was used to determine size and number and cross pair correlation was used to determine trafficking of endogenously expressed ACE2 in and out of lipid domains.

ResultsPropofol, tetracaine, and HCQ inhibit SARS2-PV viral entry. HCQ directly perturbs both GM1 lipid rafts and PIP2 domains. GM1 rafts increased in size and number similar to anesthetic disruption of lipid rafts; PIP2 domains decreased in size and number. HCQ blocked both GM1 and PIP2 domains ability to attract and cluster ACE2.

ConclusionsWe conclude HCQ is an anesthetic-like compound that disrupts GM1 lipid rafts similar to propofol and other local or general anesthetics. Furthermore, we conclude disruption of GM1 raft function, and not the concentration of GM1 raft molecules, governs the antiviral properties of HCQ. HCQ disruption of the membrane appears to also disrupt the production of host defense peptide, hence an antimicrobial such as erythromycin could be an important combined treatment. Nonetheless erythromycin has anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and may combine with HCQ to reduce infection.

KEY POINTSQuestion: What is the molecular basis for antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and propofol?

74,"Discovery of Clioquinol and Analogues as Novel Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection, ACE2 and ACE2 - Spike Protein Interaction In Vitro","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as an ongoing global pandemic. Presently, there are no clinically approved vaccines nor drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Here in, we discovered Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a FDA approved drug and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral activity showing strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction. Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for clinical development of potential therapeutics for COVID-19.","Olaleye, O.

75,SRSF protein kinases 1 and 2 are essential host factors for human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2,"Antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are needed to treat the pandemic disease COVID-19. Pharmacological targeting of a host factor required for viral replication can suppress viral spread with a low probability of viral mutation leading to resistance. Here, we used a genome-wide loss of function CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human lung epithelial cells to identify potential host therapeutic targets. Validation of our screening hits revealed that the kinase SRPK1, together with the closely related SRPK2, were jointly essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication; inhibition of SRPK1/2 with small molecules led to a dramatic decrease (more than 100,000-fold) in SARS-CoV-2 virus production in immortalized and primary human lung cells. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that SPRK1/2 phosphorylate the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at sites highly conserved across human coronaviruses and, due to this conservation, even a distantly related coronavirus was highly sensitive to an SPRK1/2 inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that SRPK1/2-targeted therapies may be an efficacious strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus-mediated diseases.","Heaton, B. E.; Trimarco, J.

76,Designed Variants of Recombinant ACE2-Fc that Decouple Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities from Unwanted Cardiovascular Effects,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and recombinant ACE2 decoys are being evaluated as new antiviral therapies. We designed and tested an ACE2-Fc fusion protein, which has the benefits of a long pharmacological half-life and the potential to facilitate immune clearance of the virus. Out of the concern that the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 may unintentionally alter the balance of its hormonal substrates and cause adverse cardiovascular effects in treatment, we performed a mutagenesis screening for inactivating the enzyme. Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture. This study established new ACE2-Fc candidates as antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 without potentially harmful side effects from ACE2s catalytic actions toward its vasoactive substrates.","Liu, P.; Xie, X.; Gao, L.; Jin, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351v1?rss=1,2020-08-14,2020-08-14,,False

78,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike harbours a lipid binding pocket which modulates stability of the prefusion trimer,"Large trimeric Spikes decorate SARS-CoV-2 and bind host cells via receptor binding domains (RBDs). We report a conformation in which the trimer is  locked into a compact well-ordered form. This differs from previous structures where the RBD can flip up to recognise the receptor. In the  locked form regions associated with fusion transitions are stabilised and the RBD harbours curved lipids. The acyl chains bind a hydrophobic pocket in one RBD whilst the polar headgroups attach to an adjacent RBD of the trimer. By functional analogy with enteroviral pocket factors loss of the lipid would destabilise the  locked form facilitating receptor attachment, conversion to the postfusion state and virus infection. The nature of lipids available at the site of infection might affect the antigenicity/pathogenicity of released virus. These results reveal a potentially druggable pocket and suggest that the natural prefusion state occludes neutralising RBD epitopes, achieving conformational shielding from antibodies.

Here, we describe an influenza-virus-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. We incorporated a membrane-anchored form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in place of the neuraminidase (NA) coding sequence in an influenza virus also possessing a mutation that reduces the affinity of hemagglutinin for its sialic acid receptor. The resulting {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu virus can be generated by reverse genetics and grown to high titers in cell culture. A single-dose intranasal inoculation of mice with {Delta}NA(RBD)-Flu elicits serum neutralizing antibody titers against SAR-CoV-2 comparable to those observed in humans following natural infection (~1:250).

80,Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 exhibit strong association with increased genome-wide mutation load,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for human cases of COVID-19, a pandemic with global impact that first emerged in late 2019. Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","Eskier, D.; Suner, A.; Oktay, Y.; KarakuÌˆlah, G.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.248732v1?rss=1,2020-08-13,2020-08-13,,False

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baddock, H.

A screen of 19 small molecules and 3 biologics was conducted in cell culture and the impact of treatment on viral titer was quantified by plaque assay. The screen identified 4 FDA-approved small molecules, Maraviroc, FTY720 (Fingolimod), Atorvastatin and Nitazoxanide that were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Confocal microscopy with over expressed S protein demonstrated that Maraviroc reduced the extent of S-protein mediated cell fusion as observed by fewer multinucleate cells in drug-treated cells. Mathematical modeling of drug-dependent viral multiplication dynamics revealed that prolonged drug treatment will exert an exponential decrease in viral load in a multicellular/tissue environment.

83,Membrane Nanoparticles Derived from ACE2-rich Cells Block SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic worldwide necessitates the development of novel effective agents against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg-1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells. Our study demonstrates a easy-to-acheive memrbane nano-antagonist for curbing SARS-CoV-2, which enriches the existing antiviral arsenal and provides new possibilities to treat COVID-19.

84,Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Lung Organoids: a Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Drug Test,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication, assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","Pei, R.; Feng, J.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, H.; Li, L.; Yang, X.; He, J.; Xiao, S.; Xiong, J.; Lin, Y.; Wen, K.; Zhou, H.; Chen, J.; Rong, Z.; Chen, X.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244350v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
85,TRIM28 regulates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by targeting ACE2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into human cells. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is known to be involved in multiple processes including antiviral restriction, endogenous retrovirus latency and immune response, it is recently reported to be co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptor in type II pneumocytes; however, the roles of TRIM28 in ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remain unclear. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs). In a co-culture model of NK cells and lung epithelial cells, our results demonstrated that NK cells inhibit TRIM28 and promote ACE2 expression in lung epithelial cells, which was partially reversed by depletion of interleukin-2 and blocking of granzyme B in the co-culture medium. Furthermore, TRIM28 knockdown enhanced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma})-induced ACE2 expression through a mechanism involving upregulating IFN-{gamma} receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in both A549 and PAEpiCs. Importantly, the upregulated ACE2 induced by TRIM28 knockdown and co-culture of NK cells was partially reversed by dexamethasone in A549 cells but not PAEpiCs. Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.","Wang, Y.; Fan, Y.; Huang, Y.; Du, T.; Liu, Z.; Huang, D.; Wang, Y.; Wang, N.; Zhang, P.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247825v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247825v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
86,Rapid endothelialitis and vascular inflammation characterise SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung-on-chip model,"BackgroundSevere manifestations of COVID-19 include hypercoagulopathies and systemic endothelialitis. The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.

MethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.

FindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.

InterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.

87,Worldwide tracing of mutations and the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2,"Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations.

Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating coronavirus infections. In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved non-structural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics approaches, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV2 helicase in its apo- and ATP/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ~970,000 chemical compounds against the ATP binding site to identify potential inhibitors.

89,Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2,"A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is urgently needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers roughly ten-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain trimer despite a more than five-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the nanoparticle immunogens target multiple distinct epitopes on the RBD, suggesting that they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a significantly lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the protein components and assembled nanoparticles, especially compared to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S trimer, suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms for inducing potent neutralizing antibody responses and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the lead RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic.","Walls, A.

Unlike CAR T cells, which need to be developed using primary T cells derived from COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia, clinical success of CAR NK cell immunotherapy is possible through the development of allogeneic, universal, and  off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from a third party, which will significantly broaden the application and reduce costs. Here, we develop a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of CR3022 (henceforth, CR3022-CAR-NK), a broadly neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and can be activated by pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-S viral particles in vitro. Further, CR3022-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 infected target cells. Thus,  off-the-shelf CR3022-CAR-NK cells may have the potential to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Ma, M.

91,Coronacept - a potent immunoadhesin against SARS-CoV-2,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Computational analysis of mammalian ACE2 orthologues suggests various residues at the interface with the viral receptor binding domain that could facilitate tighter interaction compared to the human-ACE2. Introducing several mutations to the human-ACE2 resulted with significantly augmented affinity to the viral spike complex. This modified human-ACE2 fused to an Fc portion of an antibody makes a potent immunoadhesin that effectively targets SARS-CoV-2.,"Cohen-Dvashi, H.; Weinstein, J.; Katz, M.; Eilon, M.; Mor, Y.; Shimon, A.; Strobelt, R.; Shemesh, M.; Fleishman, S.

92,Suppression of MDA5-mediated antiviral immune responses by NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5) acts as a cytoplasmic RNA sensor to detect viral dsRNA and mediates type I interferon (IFN) signaling and antiviral innate immune responses to infection by RNA viruses. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, MDA5 is activated with K63-linked polyubiquitination and then triggers the recruitment of MAVS and activation of TBK1 and IKK, subsequently leading to IRF3 and NF-{kappa}B phosphorylation. Great numbers of symptomatic and severe infections of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading worldwide, and the poor efficacy of treatment with type I interferon and antiviral agents indicates that SARS-CoV-2 escapes from antiviral immune responses via an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) acts as an innate immune suppressor and inhibits type I IFN signaling to promote infection of RNA viruses. It downregulates the expression of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines by binding to MDA5 and impairing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our findings reveal that NSP8 mediates innate immune evasion during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may serve as a potential target for future therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases.

ImportanceThe large-scale spread of COVID-19 is causing mass casualties worldwide, and the failure of antiviral immune treatment suggests immune evasion. It has been reported that several nonstructural proteins of severe coronaviruses suppress antiviral immune responses; however, the immune suppression mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we revealed that NSP8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly blocks the activation of the cytosolic viral dsRNA sensor MDA5 and significantly downregulates antiviral immune responses. Our study contributes to our understanding of the direct immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 by showing that NSP8 suppresses the most upstream sensor of innate immune responses involved in the recognition of viral dsRNA.","Yang, Z.; Zhang, X.; Wang, F.; Wang, P.; Li, X.; Kuang, E.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.12.247767v1?rss=1,2020-08-12,2020-08-12,,False
93,The selection of reference genome and the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2,"AbstractsThe pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a great impact on the whole world. In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins were considered a potential intermediate host. To assemble the coronavirus found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 were used a reference genome in most of studies, assuming that pangolins CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in the evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Y.; Yan, C.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.245290v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
94,Development of CpG-adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as a subunit vaccine against COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health emergency. The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","Kuo, T.-Y.; Lin, M.-Y.; Coffman, R. L.; Campbell, J.

95,Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","Shi, G.; Kenney, A.

96,K18-hACE2 mice develop respiratory disease resembling severe COVID-19,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.

Authors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","Yinda, C.

97,"Pleiotropic effect of Lactoferrin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection: in vivo, in silico and in vitro preliminary evidences","The current treatments against SARS-CoV-2 have proved so far inadequate. A potent antiviral drug is yet to be discovered. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein, secreted by exocrine glands and neutrophils, possesses an antiviral activity extendable to SARS-Cov-2.

We performed a randomized, prospective, interventional study assessing the role of oral and intra-nasal lactoferrin to treat mild-to-moderate and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to prevent disease evolution. Lactoferrin induced an early viral clearance and a fast clinical symptoms recovery in addition to a statistically significant reduction of D-Dimer, Interleukin-6 and ferritin blood levels. The antiviral activity of lactoferrin related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells and protein-protein docking methods, provided the direct recognition between lactoferrin and spike S, thus hindering the spike S attachment to the human ACE2 receptor and consequently virus entering into the cells.

Lactoferrin can be used as a safe and efficacious natural agent to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.","Campione, E.; Lanna, C.; Cosio, T.; Rosa, L.; Conte, M.

No clear relationship between their weakly basic and hydrophobic nature upon their activity was observed.

99,Common low complexity regions for SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes as potential multidirectional risk factor in vaccine development,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 demands immediate response from the scientific communities. Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.

Author summaryThe outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","Gruca, A.; Ziemska-Legiecka, J.; Jarnot, P.; Sarnowska, E.; Sarnowski, T.; Grynberg, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.245993v1?rss=1,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,,False
