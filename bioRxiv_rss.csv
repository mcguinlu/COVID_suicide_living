0,Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus,"When a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available, limited initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","Bubar, K.

1,"Sleep Disturbances, Anxiety, and Burnout during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a nationwide cross-sectional study in Brazilian Healthcare Professionals.","Study objectives: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, anxiety, and Burnout in healthcare professionals. Methods: A survey was distributed using social media and organizational emails to Brazilian active healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. We explored potential associated factors including age, gender, occupation, workplace, work hours, income, previous infection with COVID-19, recent/current contact with COVID-19 patients, regional number of incident deaths due to COVID-19, anxiety, and burnout. We evaluated new-onset or previous insomnia worsening (primary outcome), sleep quality, and duration (secondary outcomes). Results: A total of 4,384 health professionals from all regions of the country were included in the analysis (mean age: 44{+/-}12 years, 76% females, 53.8% physicians). Overall, 55.7% were assisting patients with COVID-19, and 9.2% had a previous COVID-19 infection. New-onset insomnia symptoms or previous insomnia worsening occurred in 41.4% of respondents in parallel to 13% (n=572) new pharmacological treatments for insomnia. Prevalent anxiety and burnout during the pandemic were observed in 44.2% and 21% of participants, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that females (OR:1.756; 95% CI 1.487-2.075), weight change (decrease: OR:1.852; 95% CI 1.531-2.240; increase: OR:1.542; 95% CI 1.323-1.799), prevalent anxiety (OR:3.209; 95% CI 2.796-3.684), new-onset burnout (OR:1.986; 95% CI 1.677-2.352), family income reduction >30% (OR:1.366; 95% CI 1.140-1.636) and assisting patients with COVID-19 (OR:1.293; 95% CI 1.104-1.514) were independently associated with new-onset or worsening of previous insomnia. Conclusions: We observed a huge burden of insomnia in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, dedicated approaches for sleep health are highly desirable.","Drager, L.; Pachito, D.; Moreno, C.; Tavares, A.; Conway, S. G.; Assis, M.; Sguillar, D. A.; Moreira, G.

2,"Exploring Patterns and Trends in COVID-19 Exports from China, Italy, and Iran","This paper investigates COVID-19 exported cases by country and the time it takes between entry until case confirmation for the exported cases using publicly available data. We report that the average days from entry to confirmation is 7.7, 5.0 and 4.7 days for travelers from China, Italy, and Iran respectively. Approximately, one-third of all exported cases were confirmed within 3 days of entry suggesting these travelers were mildly symptomatic or symptomatic in arrival. We also found that earlier exported cases from each country had a longer time between entry to confirmation by an average of 3 days compared to later exports. Based upon our data, reported exported cases from South Korea were far fewer in comparison to those from China, Italy and Iran. Therefore, we suggest that careful monitoring of likely symptomatic travelers and better public awareness may lead to faster confirmation as well as reduced transmission of COVID-19 pandemic.","Soliman, A.

3,Vitamin D and Covid-19 Susceptibility and Severity: a Mendelian Randomization Study,"Introduction Increased vitamin D levels, as reflected by 25OHD measurements, has been proposed to protect against Covid-19 disease based on in-vitro, observational, and ecological studies. However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D MR studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess the effect of circulating 25OHD levels on Covid-19 susceptibility. Methods Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a 443,734-participant genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of Covid-19 susceptibility and severity from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used to test the effect of 25OHD levels on these outcomes. Cohorts from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS included up to 966,395 individuals of European ancestry. Results Genetically increased 25OHD levels by one standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no clear effect on susceptibility but tended to increase the odds ratio of hospitalization (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.11) and severe disease (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.87, 5.55). Extensive sensitivity analyses probing the assumptions of MR provided consistent estimates. Conclusion These findings do not support a protective role of increased 25OHD levels on Covid-19 outcomes and may suggest harm. At present, individuals should not use vitamin D supplements to protect against Covid-19 outcomes, and on-going supplementation trials should closely monitor for signals of harm.","Butler-Laporte, G.; Nakanishi, T.; Mooser, V.; Morrison, D.

4,Heterogeneity and Superspreading Effect on Herd Immunity,"We model and calculate the fraction of infected population necessary for herd immunity to occur,taking into account the heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility, as well as the correlation between the two parameters. We show that these cause the reproduction number to decrease with progression, and consequently have a drastic effect on the estimate of the necessary percentage of the population that has to contract the disease for herd immunity to be reached. We discuss the implications to COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Safra, S.; Oz, Y.; Rubinstein, I.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189290v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.20189290v1?rss=1,2020-09-10,2020-09-10,,True
5,Assessing the influence of climate on future wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks,"High susceptibility has limited the role of the climate in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date. However, understanding a possible future effect of climate, as susceptibility declines and the northern-hemisphere winter approaches, is an important open question. Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical controls (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results imply a role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, however, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a greater impact on generating accurate predictions and reflects the strong leverage of NPIs on future outbreak severity.","Baker, R.

6,COVID-19 Biomarkers in research: Extension of the OncoMX cancer biomarker data model to capture biomarker data from other diseases.,"Scientists, medical researchers, and health care workers have mobilized worldwide in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; SCoV2). Preliminary data have captured a wide range of host responses, symptoms, and lingering problems post-recovery within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, co-morbidities, genetics, and other factors. As COVID-19-related data continue to accumulate from disparate groups, the heterogeneous nature of these datasets poses challenges for efficient extrapolation of meaningful observations, hindering translation of information into clinical applications. Attempts to utilize, analyze, or combine biomarker datasets from multiple sources have shown to be inefficient and complicated, without a unifying resource. As such, there is an urgent need within the research community for the rapid development of an integrated and harmonized COVID-19 Biomarker Knowledgebase. By leveraging data collection and integration methods, backed by a robust data model developed to capture cancer biomarker data we have rapidly crowdsourced the collection and harmonization of COVID-19 biomarkers. Our resource currently has 138 unique biomarkers. We found multiple instances of the same biomarker substance being suggested as multiple biomarker types during our extensive cross-validation and manual curation. As a result, our Knowledgebase currently has 265 biomarker type combinations. Every biomarker entry is made comprehensive by bringing in together ancillary data from multiple sources such as biomarker accessions (canonical UniProtKB accession, PubChem Compound ID, Cell Ontology ID, Protein Ontology ID, NCI Thesaurus Code, and Disease Ontology ID), BEST biomarker category, and specimen type (Uberon Anatomy Ontology) unified with ontology standards. Our preliminary observations show distinct trends in the collated biomarkers. Most biomarkers are related to the immune system (SAA, TNF-, and IP-10) or coagulopathies (D-dimer, antithrombin, and VWF) and a few have already been established as cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-2). These trends align with the proposed hypotheses of clinical manifestations compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology. We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker resource that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike.

7,Real-time conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spikes on virus particles,"SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mediates entry into cells and is critical for vaccine development against COVID-19. S is synthesized as a precursor, processed into S1 and S2 by furin proteases, and activated for fusion when human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) engages the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and when the N-terminus of S2 is proteolytically processed. Structures of soluble ectodomains and native virus particles have revealed distinct conformations of S, including a closed trimer with all RBD oriented downward, trimers with one or two RBDs up, and hACE2-stabilized conformations with up to three RBD oriented up. Real-time information that connects these structures, however, has been lacking. Here we apply single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate, with trypsin partially activating S. Conformational preferences of convalescent patient plasma and monoclonal antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either direct competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and on conformations for immunogen design.","Lu, M.; Uchil, P. D.; Li, W.; Zheng, D.; Terry, D.

8,Susceptibility of domestic swine to experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for COVID-19 has been shown to infect a number of species. The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, we show pigs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 following oronasal inoculation. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Pickering, B.; Smith, G.; Pinette, M.; Embury-Hyatt, C.; Moffat, E.; Marszal, P.; Lewis, C.

9,Inhibitor binding influences the protonation states of histidines in SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"The main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nucleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","Pavlova, A.; Lynch, D.

10,Conserved interactions required for in vitro inhibition of the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires a fast development of antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50microM concentration range. Our analysis and findings can facilitate and focus the development of highly potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Shitrit, A.; Zaidman, D.; Kalid, O.; Bloch, I.; Doron, D.; Yarnizky, T.; Buch, I.; Segev, I.; Ben-Zeev, E.; Segev, E.; Kobiler, O.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.288720v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.288720v1?rss=1,2020-09-10,2020-09-10,,False
11,Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain that escape antibody recognition,"Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and make a major contribution to the neutralizing antibody response elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding, and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails--including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","Greaney, A. J.; Starr, T.

12,Epigenetic Evolution of ACE2 and IL-6 Genes as Non-Canonical Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlate to COVID-19 Susceptibility in Vertebrates,"Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally within a matter of months. The virus establishes a success in balancing its deadliness and contagiousness, and causes substantial differences in susceptibility and disease progression in people of different ages, genders and pre-existing comorbidities. Since these host factors are subjected to epigenetic regulation, relevant analyses on some key genes underlying COVID-19 pathogenesis were performed to longitudinally decipher their epigenetic correlation to COVID-19 susceptibility. The genes of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, as the major virus receptor) and interleukin (IL)-6 (a key immune-pathological factor triggering cytokine storm) were shown to evince active epigenetic evolution via histone modification and cis/trans-factors interaction across different vertebrate species. Extensive analyses revealed that ACE2 ad IL-6 genes are among a subset of non-canonical interferon-stimulated genes (non-ISGs), which have been designated recently for their unconventional responses to interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory stimuli through an epigenetic cascade. Furthermore, significantly higher positive histone modification markers and position weight matrix (PWM) scores of key cis-elements corresponding to inflammatory and IFN signaling, were discovered in both ACE2 and IL6 gene promoters across representative COVID-19 susceptible species compared to unsusceptible ones. Findings characterize ACE2 and IL-6 genes as non- ISGs that respond differently to inflammatory and IFN signaling from the canonical ISGs and their epigenetic properties may serve as biomarkers to longitudinally predict COVID-19 susceptibility in vertebrates and partially explain COVID-19 inequality in people of different subgroups.","Sang, E.

13,Molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 spike affinity for human ACE2 receptor,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantially more infections, deaths, and economic disruptions than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2's higher infectivity may lie in its host receptor recognition mechanism. This is because experiments show that the human ACE2 protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to CoV-2's spike protein 5-20 fold stronger than SARS-CoV's spike protein. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained and, in fact, a comparison of X-ray structures leads to an opposite proposition. To gain insight, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations indicate that CoV-2's higher affinity is due primarily to differences in specific spike residues that are local to the spike-ACE2 interface, although there are allosteric effects in binding. Comparative analysis of equilibrium simulations reveals that while both CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 complexes have similar interfacial topologies, CoV-2's spike protein engages in greater numbers, combinatorics and probabilities of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with ACE2. We attribute CoV-2's higher affinity to these differences in polar contacts, and these findings also highlight the importance of thermal structural fluctuations in spike-ACE2 complexation. We anticipate that these findings will also inform the design of spike-ACE2 peptide blockers that, like in the cases of HIV and Influenza, can serve as antivirals.","Delgado, J.

15,Schools are not islands: Balancing COVID-19 risk and educational benefits using structural and temporal countermeasures,"Background: School closures around the world contributed to reducing the transmission of COVID-19. In the face of significant uncertainty around the epidemic impact of in-person schooling, policymakers, parents, and teachers are weighing the risks and benefits of returning to in-person education. In this context, we examined the impact of different school reopening scenarios on transmission within and outside of schools and on the share of school days that would need to be spent learning at a distance. Methods: We used an agent-based mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and interventions to quantify the impact of school reopening on disease transmission and the extent to which school-based interventions could mitigate epidemic spread within and outside schools. We compared seven school reopening strategies that vary the degree of countermeasures within schools to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, including the use of face masks, physical distancing, classroom cohorting, screening, testing, and contact tracing, as well as schedule changes to reduce the number of students in school. We considered three scenarios for the size of the epidemic in the two weeks prior to school reopening: 20, 50, or 110 detected cases per 100,000 individuals and assumed the epidemic was slowly declining with full school closures. For each scenario, we calculated the percentage of schools that would have at least one person arriving at school with an active COVID-19 infection on the first day of school; the percentage of in-person school days that would be lost due to scheduled distance learning, symptomatic screening or quarantine; the cumulative infection rate for students, staff and teachers over the first three months of school; and the effective reproduction number averaged over the first three months of school within the community. Findings: In-person schooling poses significant risks to students, teachers, and staff. On the first day of school, 5-42% of schools would have at least one person arrive at school with active COVID-19, depending on the incidence of COVID in the community and the school type. However, reducing class sizes via A/B school scheduling, combined with an incremental approach that returns elementary schools in person and keeps all other students remote, can mitigate COVID transmission. In the absence of any countermeasures in schools, we expect 6-25% of teaching and non-teaching staff and 4-20% of students to be infected with COVID in the first three months of school, depending upon the case detection rate. Schools can lower this risk to as low as 0.2% for staff and 0.1% for students by returning elementary schools with a hybrid schedule while all other grades continue learning remotely. However, this approach would require 60-85% of all school days to be spent at home. Despite the significant risks to the school population, reopening schools would not significantly increase community-wide transmission, provided sufficient countermeasures are implemented in schools. Interpretation: Without extensive countermeasures, school reopening may lead to an increase in infections and a significant number of re-closures as cases are identified among staff and students. Returning elementary schools only with A/B scheduling is the lowest risk school reopening strategy that includes some in-person learning.","Cohen, J. A.; Mistry, D.; Kerr, C. C.; Klein, D.

16,Rapid Scoping Review of Evidence of Outdoor Transmission of COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK. As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people, including both participatory and spectator sport events, protests, concerts, carnivals, festivals, and other celebrations. The review, which was designed to be undertaken rapidly in 15 days, returned 14 sources of evidence of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, and a further 21 sources that were used to set the context and understand the caveats that should be considered in interpreting the review findings. The review found very few examples of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 in everyday life among c. 25,000 cases considered, suggesting a very low risk. However risk of outdoor transmission increases when the natural social distancing of everyday life is breached, and gathering density, circulation and size increases, particularly for an extended duration. There was also evidence that weather had a behavioural effect on transmission, with temperatures that encourage outdoor activity associated with lower COVID-19 transmission. Due to lack of surveillance and tracing systems, and confounding factors and variables, there was no evidence that robustly tested transmission at outdoor mass gatherings (circa 10,000+ people), which are as likely to generate transmission from the activities they prompt (e.g. communal travel and congregation in bars) as from outdoor transmission at the gathering itself. The goal of hosts and organisers of events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people is to prevent the escalation of risk from sporadic transmission to the risk of transmission through a cluster outbreak. Considerations for such hosts and organisers include: (1) does the gathering prompt other behaviours that might increase transmission risk?; (2) for each part of the event or activity, how dense is the gathering, how much do people circulate, how large is the gathering, and how long are people there?; (3) is rapid contact tracing possible in the event of an outbreak? These considerations should take place relevant to the size of the underlying risk, which includes the rate of infection in the community and the likely attendance of vulnerable groups. Risk must be balanced and mitigated across the risk factors of density, circulation, size and duration. No one risk factor presents an inherently larger risk than any other, but neither is any one risk factor a magic bullet to eliminate risk.","Weed, M.; Foad, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188417v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188417v1?rss=1,2020-09-10,2020-09-10,,True
17,"Quantifying proximity, confinement, and interventions in disease outbreaks: a decision support framework for air-transported pathogens","The inability to communicate how infectious diseases are transmitted in human environments has triggered avoidance of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens transport in air. This measure distinguishes environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, thus allowing quantitative comparisons of the riskiness of different situations for any pathogens transported in air, including SARS-CoV-2. Particle size is a key factor in transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m. Pathogen transport is enhanced by two separate but interacting effects: proximity and confinement. Confinement in enclosed spaces overwhelms proximity after 10-15 minutes for all but the largest particles. Therefore, we review plausible strategies to reduce the confinement effect. Changes in standard ventilation and filtration can reduce person-to-person transport of 1-m particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and commercial situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10-m and 100-m particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Determining transmission modes is critical to identify intervention effectiveness, and would be accelerated with prior knowledge of ERBV. When judiciously selected, the interventions examined can provide substantial reduction in risk, and the conditions for selection are identified. The framework of size-dependent ERBV supports analysis and mitigation decisions in an emerging situation, even before other infectious parameters are well known.","Bond, T.

18,Evolution of immunity to SARS-CoV-2,"The durability of infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity has major implications for public health mitigation and vaccine development. Animal studies and the scarcity of confirmed re-infection suggests immune protection is likely, although the durability of this protection is debated. Lasting immunity following acute viral infection requires maintenance of both serum antibody and antigen-specific memory B and T lymphocytes and is notoriously pathogen specific, ranging from life-long for smallpox or measles4, to highly transient for common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Neutralising antibody responses are a likely correlate of protective immunity and exclusively recognise the viral spike (S) protein, predominantly targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 sub-domain. Multiple reports describe waning of S-specific antibodies in the first 2-3 months following infection. However, extrapolation of early linear trends in decay might be overly pessimistic, with several groups reporting that serum neutralisation is stable over time in a proportion of convalescent subjects. While SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell responses are readily induced by infection, the longitudinal dynamics of these key memory populations remains poorly resolved. Here we comprehensively profiled antibody, B and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. We find that binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection, as expected, with a similar decline in S-specific CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) frequencies. In contrast, S-specific IgG+ memory B cells (MBC) consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a significant fraction of circulating MBC. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent subjects to 74 days, with probable additive protection from B and T cells. Overall, our study suggests SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection is likely t 66 o be transiently protective at a population level. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.","Wheatley, A. K.; Juno, J. A.; Wang, J. J.; Selva, K.

19,The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on The Preventive Services in Qatar,"Background: In March 2020, Qatar started reporting increased numbers of COVID-19 cases. At that stage, containment measures were put in place. The health authority in Qatar developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care as the main component of that response and suspended all non-urgent services including preventive health services. The aim of the retrospective analysis to measure the Impact of COVID 19 on the preventive services provided in Qatar. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the preventive services utilization volume across the 27 PHCC health centers from the 1st of January 2017 to the 31st of July 2020. Results: With 17,012 no-show appointments, well-baby and Immunization services utilization demonstrated a reduction of 40% in May and started to come back to volumes higher than expected in June. The number of cancelled appointments for breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening programs were 3,481 and 5,854 respectively. The expected volumes demand has dropped by 100% in comparison to 2017 demand. Wellness services only met 20% of its projected utilization in April, however, the services picked up in June. Conclusion: These findings will guide the public health policymakers to understand the effects COVID-19 on preventive services and the risk of having an increased number of outbreaks for childhood communicable disease, cancer cases with delayed diagnosis due to the screening services suspension. In addition, the plan will address the increased number of sedately behavior due to the service's reduced utilization of wellness services.

20,"Adherence to COVID-19 pandemic prescribed recommendations, source of information and lockdown psychological impact of Nigeria social media users","Background: COVID-19 is a highly infectious viral disease that has spread to over one hundred and eight countries, including Nigeria. Countries across the globe have been implementing preventive measures towards curbing the spread and impact of the virus. Thus, the present study was aimed at assessing compliance to prescribe preventive recommendations, the psychological effect of lockdown, and the source of information among Nigeria social media users. Methods: This research implemented an online cross-sectional survey using an unidentified online Google based questionnaire to elicit required information from potential respondents via social media channels such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Facebook. On these forums, an external link with google based questionnaire was shared with Nigerians social media users to participate from 1st to 31st April 2020 and we had 1,131 respondents who participated in the survey. Results: Age and respondent's scientific or non-scientific backgrounds were the socio-demographic variables associated with respondents having psychological challenges as P<0.05. However, none of the socio-demographic variables of the respondents were associated with compliance with the recommendations as P>0.05. Also, most (63.4%) of the respondents were stressed by the feelings associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as the expected majority (80.1%) sources information about the epidemics through social media platforms. Conclusion: Given numerous uncertainties surrounding the global COVID-19 pandemics, there is a need to continuously increase awareness through various media and ensure that people are highly complying with the preventive measures being put in place by relevant authorities. Also, palliative measures should be put in place to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic.","Bolarinwa, O. A.; Olagunju, O.

21,Exhaled CO2 as COVID-19 infection risk proxy for different indoor environments and activities,"CO2 is co-exhaled with aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 by COVID-19 infected people and can be used as a proxy of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations indoors. Indoor CO2 measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO2-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. Contrary to some earlier recommendations setting a single indoor CO2 threshold, we show that the CO2 level corresponding to a given infection risk varies by over 2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with our infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO2-based indoor infection risk monitoring.","Peng, Z.; Jimenez, J.

23,A New Screening Method for COVID-19 based on Ocular Feature Recognition by Machine Learning Tools,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected several million people. With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras, could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with very high accuracy. We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the triage management or the clinical diagnosis. To further evaluate our algorithm and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai public health clinic center of Fudan University, we conduct a study of analyzing the eye-region images of 303 patients (104 COVID-19, 131 pulmonary, and 68 ocular patients), as well as 136 healthy people. Remarkably, our results of COVID-19 patients in testing set consistently present similar ocular pathological symbols; and very high testing results have been achieved in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Methods: Five databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05). Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

27,Robust SARS-COV-2 serological population screens via multi-antigen rules-based approach,"More than 300 SARS-COV-2 serological tests have recently been developed using either the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), the spike glycoprotein subunit (S1), and more recently the receptor binding domain (RBD). Most of the assays report very good clinical performance characteristics in well-controlled clinical settings. However, there is a growing belief that good performance characteristics that are obtained during clinical performance trials might not be sufficient to deliver good diagnostic results in population-wide screens that are usually characterized with low seroprevalence. In this paper, we developed a serological assay against N, S1 and RBD using a bead-based multiplex platform and a rules-based computational approach to assess the performance of single and multi-antigen readouts in well-defined clinical samples and in a population-wide serosurvey from blood donors. Even though assays based on single antigen readouts performed similarly well in the clinical samples, there was a striking difference between the antigens on the population-wide screen. Asymptomatic individuals with low antibody titers and sub-optimal assay specificity might contribute to the large discrepancies in population studies with low seroprevalence. A multi-antigen assay requiring partial agreement between RBD, N and S1 readouts exhibited enhanced specificity, less dependency on assay cut-off values and an overall more robust performance in both sample settings. Our data suggest that assays based on multiple antigen readouts combined with a rules-based computational consensus can provide a more robust platform for routine antibody screening.","Fotis, C.

Methodology: This pilot, open labeled, randomized, parallel study compared the effect of 30 seconds, 3 times/day gargling using 1% povidone-iodine (PVP-I), essential oils and tap water on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. Progress was monitored by day 4,6 and 12 PCR (Ct value), gargling and symptoms diary as well as clinical observations. Results: Five confirmed Stage 1 COVID-19 patients were recruited for each arm. The age range was from 22 to 56 years old. The majority were males. Two respondents had co-morbidities, which were asthma and obesity. Viral clearance was achieved at day 6 in 100%, 80%, 20% and 0% for 1% PVP-I, essential oils, tap water and control group respectively. Analysis of 1% PVP-I group versus control group showed significant p-value for comparison of PCR results on Day 4, Day 6 and Day 12. Conclusions: This preliminary study showed that gargling with 1% PVP-I and essential oils show great potential to be part of the treatment and management of Stage 1 COVID-19. Larger studies are required to ascertain the benefit of gargling for different stages of COVID-19 patients. This study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04410159).","MOHAMED, N.

32,Insufficient hyperfibrinolysis in COVID-19: a systematic review of thrombolysis based on meta-analysis and meta-regression,"Background How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. Methods We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. Findings Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862 patients) with all races and ages from 1 to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidies, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that ""insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19)"" as a peculiar mechanism. Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","Ji, H.-L.

33,Initial insights into the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala suggest local spread from limited introductions,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread from a city in China to almost every country in the world, affecting millions of individuals. Genomic approaches have been extensively used to understand the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 across the world. Kerala is a unique state in India well connected with the rest of the world through a large number of expatriates, trade, and tourism. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported in Kerala in January 2020, during the initial days of the pandemic. The rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases in the state of Kerala has necessitated the understanding of the genetic epidemiology of circulating virus, evolution, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2. We sequenced a total of 200 samples from patients at a tertiary hospital in Kerala using COVIDSeq protocol at a mean coverage of 7,755X. The analysis identified 166 unique high-quality variants encompassing 4 novel variants and 89 new variants identified for the first time in SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from India. Phylogenetic and haplotype analysis revealed that the circulating population of the virus was dominated (94.6% of genomes) by three distinct introductions followed by local spread, apart from identifying polytomies suggesting recent outbreaks. The genomes formed a monophyletic distribution exclusively mapping to the A2a clade. Further analysis of the functional variants revealed two variants in the S gene of the virus reportedly associated with increased infectivity and 5 variants that mapped to five primer/probe binding sites that could potentially compromise the efficacy of RT-PCR detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive report of genetic epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Kerala.","Radhakrishnan, C.; Divakar, M.

34,Near-Physiological-Temperature Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography Reveals Novel Conformations of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Active Site for Improved Drug Repurposing,"The COVID19 pandemic has resulted in 25+ million reported infections and nearly 850.000 deaths. Research to identify effective therapies for COVID19 includes: i) designing a vaccine as future protection; ii) structure-based drug design; and iii) identifying existing drugs to repurpose them as effective and immediate treatments. To assist in drug repurposing and design, we determined two apo structures of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 main protease at ambient-temperature by Serial Femtosecond X-ray crystallography. We employed detailed molecular simulations of selected known main protease inhibitors with the structures and compared binding modes and energies. The combined structural biology and molecular modeling studies not only reveal the dynamics of small molecules targeting main protease but will also provide invaluable opportunities for drug repurposing and structure-based drug design studies against SARS-CoV-2.","Durdagi, S.; Dag, C.; Dogan, B.; Yigin, M.; Avsar, T.; Buyukdag, C.; Erol, I.; Ertem, F.

35,Small molecules inhibit SARS-COV-2 induced aberrant inflammation and viral replication in mice by targeting S100A8/A9-TLR4 axis,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Guo, Q.; Zhao, Y.; Li, J.; Liu, J.; Qin, C.; Wang, X.; You, F.; Guo, X.; Zhang, Z.; Cao, L.; Luo, Y.; Wang, X.; Wei, X.; Chen, L.; Bao, L.; Deng, W.; Zhu, H.; Gao, R.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False
36,Potential impact on coagulopathy of gene variants of coagulation related proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2,"Thrombosis has been one of the complications of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), often associated with poor prognosis. There is a well-recognized link between coagulation and inflammation, however, the extent of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 warrants further investigation. Poly(A) Binding Protein Cytoplasmic 4 (PABPC4), Serine/Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor Clade G Member 1 (SERPING1) and Vitamin K epOxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which are all proteins linked to coagulation, have been shown to interact with SARS proteins. We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms by which some of these variants may contribute to disease are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.

Author summaryIncreased blood clotting, especially in the lungs, is a common complication of COVID-19. Infectious diseases cause inflammation which in turn can contribute to increased blood clotting. However, the extent of clot formation that is seen in the lungs of COVID-19 patients suggests that there may be a more direct link. We identified three human proteins that are involved indirectly in the blood clotting cascade and have been shown to interact with proteins of SARS virus, which is closely related to the novel coronavirus. We examined computationally the interaction of these human proteins with the viral proteins. We looked for genetic variants of these proteins and examined how these variants are distributed across populations. We investigated whether variants of these genes could impact severity of COVID-19. Further investigation around these variants may provide clues for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 particularly in minority groups.","Holcomb, D.; Alexaki, A.; Hernandez, N.; Laurie, K.; Kames, J.; Hamasaki-Katagiri, N.; Komar, A.

Analyses of proteins such as primary receptors and co-receptors (co-factors) that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells will provide important clues to help control the virus. Here, we identified host cell membrane protein candidates that were present in proximity to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins through the use of proximity labeling and proteomics analysis. The identified proteins represent candidate key factors that may be required for viral entry. Our results indicated that a number of membrane proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17, and CD133, were identified to co-localize with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2 cells that were used to expand the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

38,"Understanding SARSCOV-2 propagation, impacting factors to derive possible scenarios and simulations","We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016/2017 or 1999/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.","Mehl-Madrona, L.

Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of the illness. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 individuals. IgA responses in plasma generally correlate with IgG responses and clones of IgM, IgG and IgA producing B cells that are derived from common progenitors are evident. Plasma IgA monomers are 2-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form in the nasopharynx, are on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers. Thus, secretory IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.","Wang, Z.; Lorenzi, J. C.

40,Transcriptomic dysregulations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human nasopharyngeal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,"IntroductionOver 24 million people have been infected globally with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, with more than 820,000 succumbing to the resulting COVID-19 disease as of the end of August 2020. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls.

MethodsWe used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined.

ResultsWe found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups.

ConclusionOur results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We apply these models to public TCR data and show how they can be used to study T-cell longitudinal profiles in COVID-19 patients to characterize how the adaptive immune system reacts to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our findings confirm prior knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cell diversity increases over the course of disease progression. However our results show a difference between those T cells that react to epitope unique to SARS-CoV-2, which show a more prominent increase, and those T cells that react to epitopes common to other coronaviruses, which begin at a higher baseline.","Meysman, P.; Postovskaya, A.; De Neuter, N.; Ogunjimi, B.; Laukens, K.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289355v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.289355v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False

Given the panoply of potential COVID-19 diagnostic tools and therapeutic candidates that require purified spike protein and its importance for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 research, we have explored new approaches for spike production and purification. Three transient gene expression methods based on PEI-mediated transfection of CHO or HEK293 cells in suspension culture in chemically-defined media were compared for rapid production of full-length SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain. A high-cell-density protocol using DXB11-derived CHOBRI/rcTA cells gave substantially better yields than the other methods. Different forms of the spike were expressed, including the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a mutated/stabilized form (to favor expression of the full-length spike in prefusion conformation), with and without fusion to putative trimerization domains. An efficient two-step affinity purification method was also developed. Ultimately, we have been able to produce highly homogenous preparations of full-length spike, both monomeric and trimeric, with yields of 100-150 mg/L. The speed and productivity of this method support further development of CHO-based approaches for recombinant spike protein manufacturing.","Stuible, M.; Gervais, C.; Lord-Dufour, S.; Perret, S.; L'Abbe, D.; Schrag, J.; St-Laurent, G.; Durocher, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.286732v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,False
44,Interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 with host receptome through spike protein,"Host cellular receptors are key determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Virus utilizes multiple receptors for attachment, entry, or specific host responses. However, other than ACE2, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Furthermore, ACE2 cannot easily interpret the multi-organ tropisms of SARS-CoV-2 nor the clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To identify host cell receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 interactions, we performed genomic receptor profiling to screen almost all human membrane proteins, with SARS-CoV-2 capsid spike (S) protein as the target. Twelve receptors were identified, including ACE2. Most receptors bind at least two domains on S protein, the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) and the N-terminal-domain (NTD), suggesting both are critical for virus-host interaction. Ectopic expression of ASGR1 or KREMEN1 is sufficient to enable entry of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Analyzing single-cell transcriptome profiles from COVID-19 patients revealed that virus susceptibility in airway epithelial ciliated and secretory cells and immune macrophages highly correlates with expression of ACE2, KREMEN1 and ASGR1 respectively, and ACE2/ASGR1/KREMEN1 (ASK) together displayed a much better correlation than any individual receptor. Based on modeling of systemic SARS-CoV-2 host interactions through S receptors, we revealed ASK correlation with SARS-CoV-2 multi-organ tropism and provided potential explanations for various COVID-19 symptoms. Our study identified a panel of SARS-CoV-2 receptors with diverse binding properties, biological functions, and clinical correlations or implications, including ASGR1 and KREMEN1 as the alternative entry receptors, providing insights into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host, as well as a useful resource and potential drug targets for COVID-19 investigation.","Lu, Z.; Gu, Y.; Cao, J.; Zhang, X.; Gao, H.; Wang, Y.; Wang, J.; Zhang, J.; Shen, G.; Jiang, X.; Yang, J.; Zheng, X.; Xu, J.; Zhang, C.

However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these results with the current mutational status of these amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 10 distinct patients: N439K, G476S, S477N and N501Y. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.

Significance StatementWe developed a method to identify key amino acids responsible for the initial interaction between SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and human cells, through the analysis of Spike/ACE2 complexes. We further identified which of these amino acids show variants in the viral and human populations. Our results will facilitate scientists and clinicians alike in identifying the possible role of present and future Spike and ACE2 sequence variants in cell entry and general susceptibility to infection.","Ortuso, F.; Mercatelli, D.; Guzzi, P.

46,Airborne contamination of COVID-19 in hospitals: a scoping review of the current evidence.,"Introduction A controversy remains worldwide regarding the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings. We reviewed the current evidence on the air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, and the factors associated to the contamination including the viral load and the particles size. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing COVID-19 air contamination in hospital settings between 1 December 2019 and 21 July 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4/67, 6%; p=0.4). In other areas, the positivity rate was 23.8% (5/21) in toilets, 9.5% (20/221) in clinical areas, 12.4% (15/121) in staff areas, and 34.1% (14/41) in public areas. A total of 78 viral cultures were performed in three studies, and 3 (4%) were positive, all from close patients environment. The median SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.103 copies per m3 (IQR: 0.4.103-9.103) in clinical areas to 9.7.103 (5.1.103-14.3.103) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. The protective equipment removal and patients rooms had high concentrations/titre of SARS-CoV-2 with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1 micrometers region, and staff offices in the >4 micrometers region. Conclusion In hospital, the air near and away from COVID-19 patients is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with however, rare proofs of their viability. High viral loads found in toilet/bathrooms, staff and public hallways suggests to carefully consider these areas.","BIRGAND, G.; PEIFFER-SMADJA, N.; Fournier, S.; Kerneis, S.; Lescure, F.

47,Clinical Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 by Race,"Background: Studies of COVID-19 have shown that African Americans have been affected by the virus at a higher rate compared to other races. This cohort study investigated comorbidities and clinical outcomes by race among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: This is a case series of critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and mortality stratified by race. Results Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63 +/- 16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, p=0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, p=0.026) and mean BMI (33 kg/m2vs 28 kg/m2, p<0.001). Despite African Americans requiring continuous renal replacement therapy during hospitalization at higher rates than other races (27% vs 13%, p=0.011), rates of intubation, intensive care unit length of stay, and overall mortality (30% vs 24%, p=0.307) were similar. Conclusion This racially diverse series of critically ill COVID-19 patients shows that despite higher rates of comorbidities at hospital admission in African Americans compared with other races, there was no significant difference in mortality.","Marmarchi, F.; Liu, M.; Rangaraju, S.; Auld, S.

48,Functionalized TiO2 nanotube-based Electrochemical Biosensor for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly emerging viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide led the WHO declare pandemic within a few month after the first case of infection. Due to the lack of a prophylactic measure to control the virus infection and spread, early diagnosis and quarantining of infected as well as the asymptomatic individuals are necessary for the containment of this pandemic. However, the current methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis are expensive and time consuming although some promising and inexpensive technologies are coming out for emergency use. In this work, we report the synthesis of a cheap yet highly sensitive cobalt-functionalized TiO2 nanotubes (Co-TNTs)-based electrochemical biosensor and its efficacy for rapid detection of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by examining S-RBD protein as the reference material. A simple, low-cost, and one-step electrochemical anodization route was used to synthesize TNTs, followed by an incipient wetting method for cobalt functionalization of the TNTs platform, which is connected to a potentiostat for data collection. The sensor specifically detected the S-RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 even at very low concentration (range of 14 nM to 1400 nM). Additionally, our sensor showed linear response in the detection of viral protein with concentration. In summary, our Co-TNT sensor is highly effective in detecting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein in approximately 30 seconds, which can be explored for developing a point of care diagnostics for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions or saliva samples.","Vadlamani, B.

49,Blood neurofilament light concentration at admittance: a potential prognostic marker in COVID-19,"Objective To test the hypotheses that serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) can serve as biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Methods Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. Results In total, 21 % (n=10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, whereas the overall mortality rate was 13 % (n=6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p<0.001) than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p=2.6 x 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements whereas the concentrations in survivors were stable. Significantly higher concentrations of NfL were found in patients reporting fatigue, while reduced concentrations were found in patients experiencing cough, myalgia and joint pain. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.02). Conclusion Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","Aamodt, A. H.; Hogestol, E. A.; Popperud, T. H.; Holter, J.

50,Functional myeloid-derived suppressor cells expand in blood but not airways of COVID-19 patients and predict disease severity,"The immunopathology of COVID-19 remains enigmatic, exhibiting immunodysregulation and T cell lymphopenia. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear. We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3{zeta} chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.","Falck-Jones, S.; Vangeti, S.; Yu, M.; Falck-Jones, R.; Cagigi, A.; Badolati, I.; Osterberg, B.; Lautenbach, M.

51,"Early indirect impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilization and outcomes of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services in Kenya","Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic is expected to result in 8.3-38.6% additional maternal deaths in many low-income countries. The objective of this paper was to determine the initial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) services in Kenya. Methods: Data for the first four months (March-June) of the pandemic and the equivalent period in 2019 were extracted from Kenya Health Information System. Two-sample test of proportions for hospital attendance for select RMNCAH services between the two periods were computed. Results: There were no differences in monthly mean ({+/-}SD) attendance between March-June 2019 vs 2020 for antenatal care (400,191.2{+/-}12,700.0 vs 384,697.3{+/-}20,838.6), hospital births (98,713.0{+/-}4,117.0 vs 99,634.5{+/-}3,215.5), family planning attendance (431,930.5{+/-}19,059.9 vs 448,168.3{+/-}31,559.8), post-abortion care (3,206.5{+/-}111.7 vs 448,168.3{+/-}31,559.8) and pentavalent 1 immunisation (114,701.0{+/-}3,701.1 vs 110,915.8{+/-}7,209.4), p>0.05. However, there were increasing trends for adolescent pregnancy rate, significant increases in FP utilization among young people (25.7% to 27.0%), injectable (short-term) FP method uptake (58.2% to 62.3%), caesarean section rate (14.6% to 15.8%), adolescent maternal deaths (6.2% to 10.9%) and fresh stillbirths (0.9% to 1.0%) with a reduction in implants (long-term) uptake (16.5% to 13.0%) (p<0.05). No significant change in maternal mortality ratio between the two periods (96.6 vs 105.8/100,000 live births, p=0.1023) although the trend was increasing. Conclusion: COVID-19 may have contributed to increased adolescent pregnancy, adolescent maternal death and stillbirth rates in Kenya. If this trend persists, recent gains achieved in maternal and perinatal health in Kenya will be lost. With uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic, strategies to mitigate against catastrophic indirect maternal health outcomes are urgently needed.

52,Longitudinal immune profiling of mild and severe COVID-19 reveals innate and adaptive immune dysfunction and provides an early prediction tool for clinical progression,"With a rising incidence of COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality worldwide, it is critical to elucidate the innate and adaptive immune responses that drive disease severity. We performed longitudinal immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 patients and healthy donors. We observed a dynamic immune landscape of innate and adaptive immune cells in disease progression and absolute changes of lymphocyte and myeloid cells in severe versus mild cases or healthy controls. Intubation and death were coupled with selected natural killer cell KIR receptor usage and IgM+ B cells and associated with profound CD4 and CD8 T cell exhaustion. Pseudo-temporal reconstruction of the hierarchy of disease progression revealed dynamic time changes in the global population recapitulating individual patients and the development of an eight-marker classifier of disease severity. Estimating the effect of clinical progression on the immune response and early assessment of disease progression risks may allow implementation of tailored therapies.","Rendeiro, A.

Herein, we adopted a newly developed high-throughput epitope mapping technology (AbMap), analyzed 55 COVID-19 convalescent sera and 226 antibody samples enriched by specific proteins or peptides from these sera. We revealed three areas that are rich of IgG epitopes, two are on Spike protein but outside of RBD, and one is on Nucleocapsid protein. We identified 29 significant epitopes on Spike protein, from two of these significant epitopes, two critical epitope residues were found, i. e., D936 and P1263, which are highly related to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we provided the first global map of IgG binding epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 at single amino acid resolution.

54,Tracking Smell Loss to Identify Healthcare Workers with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCW) treating COVID-19 patients are at high risk for infection and may also spread infection through their contact with vulnerable patients. Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurologic symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01). Conclusions: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of COVID-19 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.","Weiss, J. J.; Attuquayefio, T. N.; White, E. B.; Li, F.; Herz, R. S.; White, T.

Methods: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N=866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020 - May 4, 2020. Results: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p=0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001). Hispanic patients had fewer comorbidities yet comparable rates of ICU or death (34% vs 36%). Nonetheless, a greater proportion of Hispanic patients recovered by 14 days after presentation (62% vs 45%, p<0.001; OR = 1.99, p = 0.011 in multivariable adjusted model) and fewer died (2% versus 18%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Hospitalized Hispanic patients were younger and had fewer comorbidities compared to White/non-Hispanic patients; despite comparable rates of ICU care or death, a greater proportion recovered.

56,Effect of Screen time on Glycaemic control of Type 2 Diabetes patients during COVID-19 Outbreak: A Survey based Study,"Introduction: Decreased workout during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a serious issue for the patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), since their glycaemic control is very much related to that. COVID-19 has posed a severe health issue that is playing havoc on the aged patients with existing comorbidities. Studies have shown mixed reports of social media on T2DM, with some showing positive results due to increased use of apps and adherence to lifestyle, while others have shown adiposity and glycaemic control related to hours spent on-screen time in children. Data on adult T2DM patients screen time activity and prevailing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and, post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) is sparse. Aim: To study the effect of screen-time spent on social media per day on glycaemic parameters of T2DM patients. Materials and methods: Data was collected for T2DM patients giving informed written consent and meeting a set of pre-specified inclusion criteria. Through two rounds of surveys done from May 15 to June 26, the authors collected the answers to a set of questionnaires from a total of 344 patients sent via email. Due to the non-availability of data from a few patients, a total of 229 patients data were finally analyzed. SPSS software version V21 was used to perform Binary logistic regression for calculating the odds ratio (OR) of the categorical variables. The outcomes, looked for in the analysis, were poor control of glycaemic parameters like HbA1c (defined by >7%), FBS (defined by >150 mg/dL) and, PPBS (defined by >200 mg/dL) and the exposure variables were Screen time spent by the person per day for all the three glycaemic parameters and, doctors visit and, daily exercise for HbA1c outcome. Results: A total of 173 patients had a screen time (henceforth, it means time spent on social media) of less than 2 hours/day in the study sample. Among the 173 patients, 73 (42.2%) had achieved HbA1c less than 7%, whereas the remaining 100 (57.8%) had HbA1c more than 7%. On the other hand, 56 patients had a screen time of more than 2 hours, of which 44 (72.73%) had HbA1c more than 7%. Among the 173 patients, only 89 (51.44%) had an FBS value of more than 150 mg/dL as compared to 46 (82.12%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. Out of these 173 patients, only 43 (24.86%) had a PPBS value of more than 200 mg/dL as compared to 41 (73.21%) with a screen time of more than 2 hours. It was found that the odds of having a poor glycaemic control as per HbA1c, FBS and PPBS is 2.67 times higher (95%CI: 1.91-6.95), 4.34 times higher (95%CI: 1.52-4.76) and, 8.26 times higher (95%CI: 4.26-11.83) in the cohort with a screen time of more than 2 hours as compared to the cohort with a screen time of less than 2 hours, respectively. Conclusion: There seems to be an increased risk of uncontrolled glycaemic indices with increased screen time and, decreased work out. This is a small study and the findings need to be corroborated with larger sample size.","Roy, S.; Bhattacharjee, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20188961v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20188961v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
57,COVID-19 Transmission Within Danish Households: A Nationwide Study from Lockdown to Reopening,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global public health threats in recent times. Understanding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance to be able to respond to outbreaks and take action against spread of the disease. Transmission within the household is a concern, especially because infection control is difficult to apply within the household domain. Methods We used comprehensive administrative register data from Denmark, comprising the full population and all COVID-19 tests, to estimate household transmission risk and attack rate. Results We studied the testing dynamics for COVID-19 and found that the day after receiving a positive test result within the household, 35% of potential secondary cases were tested and 13% of these were positive. After a primary case in 6,782 households, 82% of potential secondary cases were tested within 14 days, of which 17% tested positive as secondary cases, implying an attack rate of 17%. Among primary cases, those aged 0-24 were underrepresented when compared with the total population. We found an approximately linearly increasing relationship between attack rate and age. We investigated the transmission risk from primary cases by age, and found an increasing risk with age of primary cases for adults, while the risk seems to decrease with age for children. Conclusions Although there is an increasing attack rate and transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 with age, children are also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 within the household.","Lyngse, F. P.; Kirkeby, C.

58,Modelling the epidemic growth of preprints on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2,"The response of the scientific community to the global health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented number of manuscripts in a short period of time, the vast majority of which has been shared in the form of preprints posted before peer review on preprint repositories. This surge in preprint publications has in itself attracted considerable attention, although mostly in the bibliometric literature. In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints. This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future. We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power-law decay. This Zipf-like law indicates the presence of a cumulative advantage effect, whereby servers that already have more preprints receive more submissions.","Vasconcelos, G. L.; Cordeiro, L.

60,First report on the Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolate genetic diversity,"Remaining a major healthcare concern with nearly 27 million confirmed cases worldwide at the time of writing, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 880 thousand deaths since its outbreak in China, December 2019. First case of a person testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection within the territory of the Republic of Latvia was registered on 2nd of March 2020, nine days prior to the pandemic declaration by WHO. Since then, more than 230 000 tests were carried out confirming a total of 1330 cases of COVID-19 in the country as of 20th of August 2020. Rapidly reacting to the spread of the infection, an ongoing sequencing campaign was started mid-March in collaboration with the local testing laboratories, with an ultimate goal in sequencing as much local viral isolates as possible, resulting in first full-length SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome sequences from the Baltics region being made publicly available in early April. With 109 viral isolates representing ~8.2% of the total COVID-19 cases in the country being completely sequenced as of today, here we provide a first report on the genetic diversity of Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.","Zrelovs, N.; Ustinova, M.; Silamikelis, I.; Birzniece, L.; Megnis, K.; Rovite, V.; Freimane, L.; Silamikele, L.; Ansone, L.; Pjalkovskis, J.; Fridmanis, D.; Priedite, M.; Caica, A.; Gavars, M.; Perminovs, D.; Storozenko, J.; Savicka, O.; Dimina, E.; Dumpis, U.; Klovins, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190504v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
61,Influenza may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2,"As in past pandemics, co-circulating pathogens may play a role in the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we hypothesized that influenza interacted with SARS-CoV-2 during the early 2020 epidemic of COVID-19 in Europe. We developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, combined with mortality incidence data in four European countries, to test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza. We found consistent evidence for a 2-2.5-fold population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation. These results suggest the need to increase vaccination against influenza, not only to reduce the burden due to influenza viruses, but also to counteract their facilitatory impact on SARS-CoV-2.","Domenech de Celles, M.; Casalegno, J.-S.; Lina, B.; Opatowski, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189779v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20189779v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True

63,"Passive, open access data measures movement and predicts COVID-19 cases","Background. In the months following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions led to widespread implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing contacts and transmission. In the US, state and local governments introduced and enforced the bulk of interventions, including university closures. As universities closed, student departures decreased the total population size of college towns while state-level interventions decreased contacts among remaining residents. Though the pandemic continues without pharmaceutical interventions, businesses have begun to reopen, and many universities have resumed operations. These actions have increased contacts and population sizes in college towns. Monitoring movement to implement adaptive policies will be critical for outbreak management. Methods. We use publicly available remotely-sensed nighttime lights and traffic cameras to measure the impact of restriction policies on movement and activities in the university town of State College, and the surrounding areas of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Results. At the county level, nighttime radiance did not differ significantly across restriction phases and largely reflected seasonal fluctuations seen in previous years. Throughout the county, traffic volumes were lowest during the most severe period of restrictions ('Red phase' in Pennsylvania). As restrictions eased, traffic volumes grew, indicating increased movement within and between population centers. We show that real-time, publicly available traffic data captured behavioral responses and compliance to different restrictions phases. We also demonstrate that these increases in activity levels precede increases in reported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion. Passively collected data can measure population-level movement in response to restrictions and changes in these measured movements are reflected in observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Measuring these changes in movements and contacts in near real time can inform local adaptive interventions to curtail outbreaks.","Faust, C. L.; Lambert, B.; Kochenour, C.; Robinson, A.

64,COVID-19 in patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases in East London: A single-centre cohort study,"Objective The impact of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions is not clearly understood. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age>70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.","Dayem Ullah, A. Z. M.; Sivapalan, L.; Chelala, C.; Kocher, H.

65,"Seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers of the Sanitary Region VIII, at province of Buenos Aires","Introduction: The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers of the Sanitary Region VIII, at province of Buenos Aires during June 2020. Methods: a cross-sectional design was used. A probabilistic sampling by two-stage conglomerates was carried out. Data were collected from a self-administered questionnaire and a blood sample for antibody identification. The COVIDAR IgG and IgM test were used. RESULTS: 738 health workers were included; the overall response rate was 73.80%. 71.83% of that were women; age showed a normal distribution. Nurses and doctors accounted for more than half of the staff. 75.86% of people claimed to always use Personal Protective Equipment. 5.61% of people had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 4.60% of people had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab with a negative result. Five workers had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (four women and one man) with negative IgM. The mean age of the cases was 35 years old; two of them were asymptomatic; neither of them had a swab sample taken. The overall seroprevalence was 0.75%, with no significant differences between strata. Discussion: the seroprevalence found was low; indicating a large proportion of workers was susceptible to infection. We stress the need to complement passive epidemiological surveillance strategies with serological monitoring in health workers.","Silva, A.; Aguirre, M. F.; Ballejo, C.; Marro, M.

66,The impact of COVID-19 on the lives and mental health of Australian adolescents,"Objective: There has been significant disruption to the lives and mental health of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact nature of the effects is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Li, S.; Beames, J.; Newby, J.; Maston, K.; Christensen, H.; Werner-Seidler, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.20190124v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
67,The impact of COVID-19 restriction measures on loneliness among older adults in Austria,"Background: To halt the spread of COVID-19, Austria implemented a 7-week shut-down of public life in March/April 2020 which was followed by a gradual withdrawal of these restriction measures in May/June 2020. We expect that the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Methods: We conducted three analyses to assess the association between COVID-19 public health restriction measures and loneliness: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an analysis of the correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes in loneliness (Corona panel data) from late March to early June 2020. Results: We found (1) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with previous years, (2) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults reported to be affected from and loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during shut-down compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Discussion: Our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults mental health downstream. Nonetheless, effects of longer and/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.","Stolz, E.; Mayerl, H.; Freidl, W.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190397v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190397v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
68,COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics and Effectiveness of Public Health Interventions in New York City during the 2020 Spring Pandemic Wave,"New York City experienced a large COVID-19 pandemic wave during March - May 2020. We model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the city during the pandemic and estimate the effectiveness of public health interventions (overall and for each major intervention separately) for the entire population and by age group. We estimate that the overall effective reproductive number was 2.99 at the beginning of the pandemic wave and reduced to 0.93 one week after the stay-at-home mandate. Most age groups experienced similar reductions in transmission. Interventions reducing contact rates were associated with a 70.7% (95% CI: 65.0 - 76.4%) reduction of transmission overall and >50% for all age groups during the pandemic. Face covering was associated with a 6.6% (95% CI: 0.8 - 12.4%) reduction of transmission overall and up to 20% for 65+ year-olds during the first month of implementation. Accounting for the amount of time masks are in use (i.e. mainly outside homes), these findings indicate universal masking could reduce transmission by up to 28-32% when lockdown-like measures are lifted, if the high effectiveness estimated for older adults were achieved for all ages. These estimates are verified by out-of-fit projections and support the need for implementing multiple interventions simultaneously in order to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Yang, W.; Shaff, J.; Shaman, J.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190710v1?rss=1""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190710v1?rss=1,2020-09-09,2020-09-09,,True
69,The risk of introducing SARS-CoV-2 to the UK via international travel in August 2020,"International travel poses substantial risks for continued introduction of SARS-CoV-2. As of the 17th August 2020, travellers from 12 of the top 25 countries flying into the UK are required to self-isolate for 14 days. We estimate that 895 (CI: 834-958) infectious travellers arrive in a single week, of which 87% (779, CI: 722-837) originate from countries on the UK quarantine list. We compare alternative measures to the 14 day self-isolation (78.0% effective CI: 74.4-81.6) which could be more feasible long-term. A single RT-PCR taken upon arrival at the airport is 39.6% (CI: 35.2-43.7) effective, or equivalently, it would only detect 2 in 5 infectious passengers. Alternatively, testing four days after arrival is 64.3% (CI: 60.0-68.3) effective whereas a test at the airport plus additional test four days later is 68.9% (CI: 64.9-73.0) effective. Rapidly implementing control measures for travellers from risky countries is vital to protect public health; this methodology can be quickly updated to assess the impact of any further changes to international travel policy or disease occurrence.","Taylor, R.; McCarthy, C.

70,Demographic Differences in US Adult Intentions to Receive a Potential Coronavirus Vaccine and Implications for Ongoing Study,"Abstract Background: The coronavirus pandemic's public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.","Carpiano, R.

71,A prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and prevents lung infection in non-human primates,"To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine against the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD  up, two-RBD  down state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFN{gamma}+ CD8+ T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge. BNT162b2 is currently being evaluated in a global, pivotal Phase 2/3 trial (NCT04368728).","Vogel, A.; Kanevsky, I.; Che, Y.; Swanson, K.; Muik, A.; Vormehr, M.; Kranz, L.; Walzer, K.; Hein, S.; Gueler, A.; Loschko, J.; Maddur, M.; Tompkins, K.; Cole, J.; Lui, B.

72,"Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein correlates with, but does not predict neutralization","Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA and neutralization assays we observed a strong correlation between these two parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of viral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlights the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","Ding, S.; Laumaea, A.; Gasser, R.; Medjahed, H.; Pancera, M.; Stamatatos, L.; McGuire, A.; Bazin, R.; Finzi, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287482v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
73,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Africa reveals potentially clinically relevant mutations.,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan province of the Hubei district in China and rapidly spread across the globe. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. Across the continents and specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel related. Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with sequences from COVID-19 hotspots (including China, Brazil, Italy, United State of America and the United Kingdom). To identify if there are distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to genomes from other countries, including disease hotspots, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase (NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible targets for vaccine coverage or potential therapeutic agents. Our results showed a similarity between the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes and genomes in countries including China, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and the United States of America. This study shows for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 landscape across Africa and will potentially provide insights into specific mutations to relevant proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in African populations.","Iweriebor, B.

74,UVA radiation could be a significant contributor to sunlight inactivation of SARS-CoV-2,"Past experiments demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by simulated sunlight; models have considered exclusively mechanisms involving UVB acting directly on RNA. However, UVA inactivation has been demonstrated for other enveloped RNA viruses, through indirect mechanisms involving the suspension medium. We propose a model combining UVB and UVA inactivation for SARS-CoV-2, which improves predictions by accounting for effects associated with the medium. UVA sensitivities deduced for SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with data for SARS-CoV-1 under UVA only. This analysis calls for experiments to separately assess effects of UVA and UVB in different media, and for including UVA in inactivation models.

Lay summaryRecent experiments have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by simulated sunlight; however, there are still many unknowns, including the mechanism of action and which part of the light spectrum is principally responsible. Our analysis indicates the need for targeted experiments that can separately assess the effects of UVA and UVB on SARS-CoV-2, and that sunlight inactivation models may need to be expanded to also include the effect of UVA. A first UVA-inclusive model is also proposed here. These findings have implications for how to improve the safety of the built environment, and for the seasonality of COVID-19.","Luzzatto-Fegiz, P.; Temprano-Coleto, F.; Peaudecerf, F. J.; Landel, J.

75,Interaction of human ACE2 to membrane-bound SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins,"A novel severe acute respiratory (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.","Anand, S. P.; Chen, Y.; Prevost, J.; Gasser, R.; Beaudoin-Bussieres, G.; Abrams, C.

76,In vitro study of BromAc on SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins shows synergy and disintegration at modest concentrations,"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. It is characterised by being highly contagious and nasal mucosa appears to be the primary site with subsequent spread to the lungs and elsewhere. BromAc (Bromelain & Acetylcysteine) has been described to disrupt glycoproteins by the synchronous breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulphide bonds. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target as it is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells and is formed of glycoprotein and disulphide bridges for stabilisation. Hence, we sought to determine whether BromAc has activity on the spike and envelope protein specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

DesignGel electrophoresis analysis was carried out on recombinant spike and envelope proteins that were treated with a range of concentrations of single agents and BromAc. For UV analysis of disulfide bonds reduction, both spike and envelope protein were treated with Acetylcysteine with the determination of loss of disulfide bonds.

ResultsRecombinant spike and envelope SARS-CoV-2 protein were fragmented by BromAc whilst single agents had minimal effect. Spike and envelope proteins disulphide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine.

ConclusionBromAc disintegrates the spike and envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2 and may render it non-infective. In vitro tests on live virus have been encouraging and clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent.","Akhter, J.; Pillai, K.; Badar, S.; Mekkawy, A.; Valle, S.; Morris, D.

77,Structural characterization of Nonstructural protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus and the etiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution of 1.65 [A]. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped {beta}-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV. Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein. Our results provide unparalleled insight into the molecular structure of a major pathogenic determinant of SARS-CoV-2.","Semper, C.; Watanabe, N.; Savchenko, A.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.288191v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
78,Many bat species are not potential hosts of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Evidence from ACE2 receptor usage,"Bats are the suggested natural hosts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, the latter of which caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The interaction of viral Spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to show that ACE2 orthologs from 24, 21, and 16 of 46 phylogenetically diverse bat species - including those in close and distant contact with humans - do not support entry of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and both of these coronaviruses, respectively. Furthermore, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify genetic changes in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our study demonstrates that many - if not most - bat species are not potential hosts of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and provides important insights into pandemic control and wildlife conservation.","Yan, H.; Jiao, H.; Liu, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, X.; Guo, M.; Wang, B.-J.; Lan, K.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, H.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.284737v1?rss=1,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,,False
79,Transmission of allosteric response within the homotrimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike upon recognition of ACE2 receptor by the receptor-binding domain,"The pathogenesis of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates through recognition of ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located at spikes of the virus. Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2-binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptor-bound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apo-RBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly, the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action of the trimer. Based on our results, we propose the allosteric loop of RBD as a potential drug target.","Bhattacharjee, S.; Bhattacharyya, R.; Sengupta, J.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.284901v1?rss=1,2020-09-07,2020-09-07,,False
80,Mutational Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genome in African Population,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious and pathogenic virus has claimed lot of lives globally since its outbreak in December 2019 posing dire threat on public health, global economy, social and human interaction. At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","Omotoso, O.

81,The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates early serine protease-mediated entry into organoid-derived human airway cells,"After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a second zoonotic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, emerged late 2019 in China and rapidly caused the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a public health crisis of an unprecedented scale. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral target.

Significance StatementHighly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate fundamental knowledge to the clinic, a process that is expedited through the use of relevant cell culture systems.","Mykytyn, A.

82,New insights into nCOVID-19 binding domain and its cellular receptors,"nCOVID-19 virus makes cellular entry using its spike protein protruding out on its surface. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as a receptor that mediates the viral entry by binding with the receptor binding motif of spike protein. In the present study, we elucidate the significance of N-terminal domain of spike protein in spike-receptor interactions. Recent clinical reports indicate a link between nCOVID-19 infections with patient comorbidities. The underlying reason behind this relationship is not clear. Using molecular docking, we study the affinity of the nCOVID-19 spike protein with cell receptors overexpressed under disease conditions. Our results suggest that certain cell receptors such as DC/L-SIGN, DPP4, IL22R and ephrin receptors could act as potential receptors for the spike protein. The receptor binding domain of nCOVID-19 is more flexible than that of SARS-COV and has a high propensity to undergo phase separation. Higher flexibility of nCOVID-19 receptor binding domain might enable it to bind multiple receptor partners. Further experimental work on the association of these receptors with spike protein may help us to explain the severity of nCOVID-19 infection in patients with comorbidities.","Garg, A.; Kumar, G.; Sinha, S.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.06.285023v1?rss=1,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,,False

For this reason, it is important to characterize the genome of the isolates that circulate in Latin America. To characterize the complete genome of first samples of the virus circulating in Peru, we amplified seven overlapping segments of the viral genome by RT-PCR and sequenced using Miseq platform. The results indicate that the genomes of the Peruvian SARS-COV-2 samples belong to the genetic groups G and S. Likewise, a phylogenetic and MST analysis of the isolates confirm the introduction of multiple isolates from Europe and Asia that, after border closing, were transmitted locally in the capital and same regions of the country. These Peruvian samples (56%) grouped into two clusters inside G clade and share B.1.1.1 lineage.

84,"Computationally validated SARS-CoV-2 CTL and HTL Multi-Patch Vaccines designed by reverse epitomics approach, shows potential to cover large ethnically distributed human population worldwide","BackgroundThe SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

MethodologyA novel reverse epitomics approach, ""overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches"" method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as ""Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches"", for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs.

ResultsWe identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line.

ConclusionHighly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.

We previously developed an oral adenovirus-based vaccine technology that induces both mucosal and systemic immunity in humans. Here we investigate the immunogenicity of a range of candidate adenovirusbased vaccines, expressing full or partial sequences of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, in mice. We demonstrate that, compared to expression of the S1 domain or a stabilized spike antigen, the full length, wild-type spike antigen induces significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in the periphery and in the lungs, when the vaccine is administered mucosally. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by this leading vaccine candidate at low and high doses.

In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model.","Basso, F. G.; de Paulo, A.

87,Notable sequence homology of the ORF10 protein introspects the architecture of SARS-COV-2,"The global public health is endangered due to COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having similar pathology to MERS and SARS-CoV, the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely lower than 1%. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be uniquely characterized by the accessory protein ORF10, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of nine amino acids length each, across various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes. In this study, all missense mutations found in sequence databases were examined across twnety-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants that could possibly alter viral pathogenicity. Some of these mutations decrease the stability of ORF10, e.g. I4L and V6I were found in the MoRF region of ORF10 which may also possibly contribute to Intrinsic protein disorder. Furthermore, a physicochemical and structural comparative analysis was carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid homology. The high degree of physicochemical and structural similarity of ORF10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV open questions about the architecture of SARS-CoV-2 due to the disagreement of these two ORF10 proteins over their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and change from the strand to coil at amino acid position 26, where tyrosine is present. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 is a promising pharmaceutical target and a protein which should be monitored for changes which correlate to change pathogenesis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.","Hassan, S.

90,SARS-CoV-2 infection paralyzes cytotoxic and metabolic functions of immune cells,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 infectious disease outbreak, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in 10 acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. Our findings reveal patients who suffer from an over activation of the immune system, a change of composition in infusion/intravenous fluids during infection with the aim to lower blood levels of glucose, glutamate, acetate and formate could avoid a life-threatening cytokine storm. In summary, our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disrupted CD8+ T cytotoxic functions and changes the overall metabolic functions of immune cells.","Singh, Y.; Trautwein, C.; Fendel, R.; Krickeberg, N.; Held, J.; Kreidenweiss, A.; Berezhnoy, G.; Bissinger, R.; Ossowski, S.; Salker, M.

91,"Preliminary report of preclinical efficacy and safety analysis of gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, SK-01 version 1 and OZG-3861 version 1","The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no coronavirus vaccine in the market due to the novelty of this virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become very important to reduce morbidity and mortality. At this point, inactivated vaccines are important because the straightforward process of existing infrastructure used for several licensed human vaccines can be used for SARS-CoV-2. Inactive vaccines provide an antigenic presentation similar to that when they encounter invasive virus particles of the immune system. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. Our candidate OZG-3861 version 1 (V1) is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1) is the GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine candidate. We applied the candidates intradermal to BALB/c mice to assess the toxicity and immunogenicity of the OZG-3861 V1 and SK-01 V1. Here, we report our preliminary results in vaccinated mice. When considered in terms of T and B cell responses, it was observed that especially the vaccine models containing GM-CSF as an adjuvant caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature. Another finding showed that the presence of adjuvant is more important in T cell response rather than B cell. The vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study encouraged us to start the challenge test using infective SARS-CoV-2 viruses and our second version of gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates in humanized ACE2+ mice.","SIR KARAKUS, G.; Tastan, C.; Dilek Kancagi, D.; Yurtsever, B.; Tumentemur, G.; Demir, S.; Turan, R.

92,Improvements to the ARTIC multiplex PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing using nanopore,"Genome sequencing has been widely deployed to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with more than 90,000 genome sequences uploaded to the GISAID database. We published a method for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing (https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-bbmuik6w) online on January 22, 2020. This approach has rapidly become the most popular method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Here we present improvements to the original protocol: i) an updated primer scheme with 22 additional primers to improve genome coverage, ii) a streamlined library preparation workflow which improves demultiplexing rate for up to 96 samples and reduces hands-on time by several hours and iii) cost savings which bring the reagent cost down to {pound}10 per sample making it practical for individual labs to sequence thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to support national and international genomic epidemiology efforts.","Tyson, J.

93,Genomic diversity and evolution of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in France from 309 COVID-19-infected patients,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pandemic of viral pneumonia. The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion ({Delta}21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus. Inclusion of the French cohort enabled us to identify 161 novel mutations never reported in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected worldwide. These results support a global and continuing surveillance of the emerging variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Levasseur, A.; Delerce, J.; Caputo, A.; Brechard, L.; Colson, P.; Lagier, J.-C.; Fournier, P.-E.; Raoult, D.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.282616v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.282616v1?rss=1,2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,False
94,A SARS-CoV-2 - host proximity interactome,"Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.","Samavarchi-Tehrani, P.; Abdouni, H.; Knight, J.

95,Monoclonal Antibodies Capable of Binding SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Binding Motif Specifically Prevent GM-CSF Induction.,"A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited ""cytokine storm"", and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

96,Clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data reveals population structure of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been spreading rapidly and across the globe since first being reported in December 2019. To understand the evolutionary trajectory of the coronavirus, phylogenetic analysis is needed to study the population structure of SARS-CoV-2. As sequencing data worldwide is accruing rapidly, grouping them into clusters helps to organize the landscape of population structures. To effectively group these data, computational methodologies are needed to provide more productive and robust solutions for clustering. In this study, using the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the viral sequences as input features, we utilized three clustering algorithms, namely K-means, hierarchical clustering and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies to partition the viral sequences into six major clusters. Comparison of the three clustering results reveals that the three methods produced highly consistent results, but K-means performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances among the three methods. The partition of the viral sequences revealed that the six clusters differed in their geographical distributions. Using comprehensive approaches to compare the diversity and selective pressure across the clusters, we discovered a high genetic diversity between the clusters. Based on characteristics of the mutation profiles in each cluster along with their geographical distributions and evolutionary histories, we identified the extent of molecular divergence within and between the clusters. The identification of the mutations that are strongly associated with clusters have potential implications for diagnosis and pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, the clustering method will enable further study of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.","Li, Y.; Liu, Q.; Luo, Y.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.283358v1?rss=1,2020-09-04,2020-09-04,,False
97,Multimerization- and glycosylation-dependent receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins,"Receptor binding studies using recombinant SARS-CoV proteins have been hampered due to challenges in approaches creating spike protein or domains thereof, that recapitulate receptor binding properties of native viruses. We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, K. M.; Tomris, I.; Turner, H.

98,A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, M.

99,Transcriptomic profiling of human corona virus (HCoV)-229E -infected human cells and genomic mutational analysis of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2,"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory infection. Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.

Author summaryHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs) generate respiratory tract infections. HCoV-229E is one of four known HCoV strains that circulate annually in the population for several decades. Beside these, three pandemic CoV emerged since year 2002, the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. These three strains attracted most attention for extensive research and less consideration has been given to the commonly infecting HCoVs. In this study we use Next generation sequencing analysis to understand global transcriptomic changes in human host cells following HCoV-229E infection. We found several cellular pathways that change during infection that involve cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle control, DNA replication, DNA repair, innate immune response and an interesting RNA editing enzyme which could be involve in CoVs pathogenesis.","Friedman, N.; Jacob-Hirsch, J.; Drori, Y.; Eyal, E.; Kol, N.; Nayshool, O.; Mendelson, E.; Rechavi, G.; Mandelboim, M.","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1""",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.253682v1?rss=1,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,,False
