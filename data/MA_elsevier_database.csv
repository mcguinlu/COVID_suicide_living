1,Hunters Searching among Starry Nights and at the Edges of Life,,"Breedlove, Byron",https://www.doi.org/10.3201/eid2601.ac2601,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6924909/,PMC,10.3201/eid2601.ac2601,01/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-01
2,Safety of prone positioning in critically ill patients,"Background: During the past two years, 5% of patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Hamad General Hospital (HGH) had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 ± 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 ± 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 ± 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: • Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. • Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. • Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. • Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.","Akbar, Anzila; Albadw, Naseem; Racela, Brian; Damodaran, Chokkalinga; Mustafa, Emad; Coria, Roopa; Hassan, Ali; Saif Ibrahim, Abdulsalam",https://www.doi.org/10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984011/,PMC,10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27

4,Social Responses to Epidemics Depicted by Cinema,"Films illustrate 2 ways that epidemics can affect societies: fear leading to a breakdown in sociability and fear stimulating preservation of tightly held social norms. The first response is often informed by concern over perceived moral failings within society, the second response by the application of arbitrary or excessive controls from outside the community.","Han, Qijun; Curtis, Daniel R.",https://www.doi.org/10.3201/eid2602.181022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6986850/,PMC,10.3201/eid2602.181022,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
5,The Epidemiology of Primary Central Nervous System Tumors at the National Neurologic Institute in Saudi Arabia: A Ten-Year Single-Institution Study,"OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at describing the epidemiological trends of primary CNS tumors in children and adults at the National Neurologic Institute in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological approach was used where data was obtained from the department of pathology registry files and pathology reports. The records of all patients registered from January 2005 to December 2014 with a diagnosis of primary CNS tumor (brain and spinal cord) were selected. Data about sex, age, tumor location, and histologic type were collected. The classification was based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3). RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-two (992) cases of primary CNS tumors throughout the ten years (2005 to 2014) were reviewed. There were 714 (71.97%) adults and 278 (28.02%) in the pediatric age group. Nonmalignant tumors dominated the adult population (60.08%) while malignant tumors were more frequent in the pediatric population. Gliomas constituted the most common neoplastic category in children and adults. The most common single tumor entity was meningioma (26.99%, ICD-O-3 histology codes 9530/0, 9539/1, and 9530/3). Medulloblastomas (ICD-O-3 histology codes 9470, 9471, and 9474) were the most common single tumor entity in the pediatric age group (26.62%). CONCLUSIONS: This is an institution-based, detailed, and descriptive epidemiological study of patients with primary CNS tumors in Saudi Arabia. In contrast to other regional and international studies, the medulloblastomas in our institution are more frequent than pilocytic astrocytomas. Limitations to our study included the referral bias and histology-based methodology.","Almutrafi, Amna; Bashawry, Yara; AlShakweer, Wafaa; Al-Harbi, Musa; Altwairgi, Abdullah; Al-Dandan, Sadeq",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/1429615,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044490/,PMC,10.1155/2020/1429615,15/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-15

7,A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people’s lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Qiu, Jianyin; Shen, Bin; Zhao, Min; Wang, Zhen; Xie, Bin; Xu, Yifeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7061893/,PMC,10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
8,Early warning of some notifiable infectious diseases in China by the artificial neural network,"In order to accurately grasp the timing for the prevention and control of diseases, we established an artificial neural network model to issue early warning signals. The real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods were performed to analyse four types of respiratory infectious diseases and four types of digestive tract infectious diseases in China to comprehensively determine the epidemic intensities and whether to issue early warning signals. The numbers of new confirmed cases per month between January 2004 and December 2017 were used as the training set; the data from 2018 were used as the test set. The results of RTRL showed that the number of new confirmed cases of respiratory infectious diseases in September 2018 increased abnormally. The results of the EKF showed that the number of new confirmed cases of respiratory infectious diseases increased abnormally in January and February of 2018. The results of these two algorithms showed that the number of new confirmed cases of digestive tract infectious diseases in the test set did not have any abnormal increases. The neural network and machine learning can further enrich and develop the early warning theory.","Guo, Zuiyuan; He, Kevin; Xiao, Dan",https://www.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191420,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062078/,PMC,10.1098/rsos.191420,19/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-19
9,"iCa(2+) Flux, ROS and IL-10 Determines Cytotoxic, and Suppressor T Cell Functions in Chronic Human Viral Infections","Exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells and increased IL-10 production is well-known in chronic viral infections but mechanisms leading to loss of their cytotoxic capabilities and consequent exhaustion remain unclear. Exhausted CD8(+)T cells also called T suppressors are highly immune suppressive with altered T cell receptor signaling characteristics that mark it exclusively from their cytotoxic counterparts. Our study found that iCa(2+) flux is reduced following T cell receptor activation in T suppressor cells when compared to their effector counterpart. Importantly chronic activation of murine cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells lead to reduced iCa(2+) influx, decreased IFN-γ and enhanced IL-10 production and this profile is mimicked in Tc1 cells upon reduction of iCa(2+) flux by extracellular calcium channel inhibitors. Further reduced iCa(2+) flux induced ROS which lead to IFN-γ reduction and increased IL-10 producing T suppressors through the STAT3—STAT5 axis. The above findings were substantiated by our human data where reduced iCa(2+) flux in chronic Hepatitis infections displayed CD8(+) T cells with low IFN-γ and increased IL-10 production. Importantly treatment with an antioxidant led to increased IFN-γ and reduced IL-10 production in human chronic Hep-B/C samples suggesting overall a proximal regulatory role for iCa(2+) influx, ROS, and IL-10 in determining the effector/ suppressive axis of CD8(+) T cells.","Mohanty, Subhasmita; Barik, Prakash; Debata, Nagen; Nagarajan, Perumal; Devadas, Satish",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00083,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068714/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00083,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
10,Bluetongue Serotype 3 in Israel 2013–2018: Clinical Manifestations of the Disease and Molecular Characterization of Israeli Strains,"In this paper, the results of the diagnostic activities on Bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) conducted at Kimron Veterinary Institute (Beit Dagan, Israel) between 2013 and 2018 are reported. Bluetongue virus is the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), a disease of ruminants, mostly transmitted by competent Culicoides species. In Israel, BTV-3 circulation was first detected in 2013 from a sheep showing classical BT clinical signs. It was also evidenced in 2016, and, since then, it has been regularly detected in Israeli livestock. Between 2013 and 2017, BTV-3 outbreaks were limited in sheep flocks located in the southern area only. In 2018, BTV-3 was instead found in the Israeli coastal area being one of the dominant BTV serotypes isolated from symptomatic sheep, cattle and goats. In Israeli sheep, BTV-3 was able to cause BT classical clinical manifestations and fatalities, while in cattle and goats infection ranged from asymptomatic forms to death cases, depending on either general welfare of the herds or on the occurrence of viral and bacterial co-infections. Three different BTV-3 strains were identified in Israel between 2013 and 2018: ISR-2019/13 isolated in 2013, ISR-2153/16 and ISR-2262/2/16 isolated in 2016. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of these strains showed more than 99% identity by segment (Seg) 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 sequences. In contrast, a wide range of diversity among these strains was exhibited in other viral gene segments, implying the occurrence of genome reassortment between these local circulating strains and those originating from Africa. The genome sequences of the BTV-3 isolated in 2017 and 2018 were most closely related to those of the ISR-2153/16 strain suggesting their common ancestor. Comparison of BTV-3 Israeli strains with those recently detected in the Mediterranean region uncovered high percentage identity (98.19–98.28%) only between Seg-2 of all Israeli strains and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. A 98.93% identity was also observed between Seg-4 sequences of ISR-2019/13 and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. This study demonstrated that BTV-3 has been circulating in the Mediterranean region at least since 2013, but, unlike the other Mediterranean strains, Israeli BTV-3 were able to cause clinical signs also in cattle.","Golender, Natalia; Bumbarov, Velizar; Eldar, Avi; Lorusso, Alessio; Kenigswald, Gabriel; Varsano, Joseph Seffi; David, Dan; Schainin, Shani; Dagoni, Ilan; Gur, Iosef; Kaplan, Alon; Gorohov, Anna; Koren, Ori; Oron, Eldad; Khinich, Yevgeny; Sclamovich, Ily; Meir, Abraham; Savini, Giovanni",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00112,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068852/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00112,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
11,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Infusion Shows Promise for Combating Coronavirus (COVID-19)- Induced Pneumonia,"A new study published by the journal Aging & Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020). This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.","Shetty, Ashok K",https://www.doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0301,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069463/,PMC,10.14336/ad.2020.0301,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09
12,Transplantation of ACE2(-) Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves the Outcome of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"A coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","Leng, Zikuan; Zhu, Rongjia; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yingmei; Yang, Yanlei; Han, Qin; Shan, Guangliang; Meng, Fanyan; Du, Dongshu; Wang, Shihua; Fan, Junfen; Wang, Wenjing; Deng, Luchan; Shi, Hongbo; Li, Hongjun; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhang, Fengchun; Gao, Jinming; Liu, Hongjian; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhao, Yangyang; Yin, Kan; He, Xijing; Gao, Zhengchao; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Bo; Jin, Ronghua; Stambler, Ilia; Lim, Lee Wei; Su, Huanxing; Moskalev, Alexey; Cano, Antonio; Chakrabarti, Sasanka; Min, Kyung-Jin; Ellison-Hughes, Georgina; Caruso, Calogero; Jin, Kunlin; Zhao, Robert Chunhua",https://www.doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0228,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069465/,PMC,10.14336/ad.2020.0228,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09

14,Deep Learning-Based Method of Diagnosing Hyperlipidemia and Providing Diagnostic Markers Automatically,"INTRODUCTION: The research of auxiliary diagnosis has always been one of the hotspots in the world. The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor’s diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. RESULTS: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. DISCUSSION: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.","Liu, Yuliang; Zhang, Quan; Zhao, Geng; Liu, Guohua; Liu, Zhiang",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s242585,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7073442/,PMC,10.2147/dmso.s242585,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11
15,Drug targets for corona virus: A systematic review,"The 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a major source of disaster in the 21(th) century. However, the lack of specific drugs to prevent/treat an attack is a major need at this current point of time. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to identify major druggable targets in coronavirus (CoV). We searched PubMed and RCSB database with keywords HCoV, NCoV, corona virus, SERS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV, crystal structure, X-ray crystallography structure, NMR structure, target, and drug target till Feb 3, 2020. The search identified seven major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, protease, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase) for which drug design can be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which can also be considered from the drug design perspective. The major structural proteins and NSPs may serve an important role from drug design perspectives. However, the occurrence of frequent recombination events is a major deterrent factor toward the development of CoV-specific vaccines/drugs.","Prajapat, Manisha; Sarma, Phulen; Shekhar, Nishant; Avti, Pramod; Sinha, Shweta; Kaur, Hardeep; Kumar, Subodh; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Harish; Bansal, Seema; Medhi, Bikash",https://www.doi.org/10.4103/ijp.ijp_115_20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074424/,PMC,10.4103/ijp.ijp_115_20,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

17,Role of changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor: An in silico analysis,"Many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event. Some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of morbidity/mortality in humans. Changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species. The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. An in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor. The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2. This could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Ortega, Joseph Thomas; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Pujol, Flor Helene; Rangel, Hector Rafael",https://www.doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-1167,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081066/,PMC,10.17179/excli2020-1167,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18
18,Unrevealing sequence and structural features of novel coronavirus using in silico approaches: The main protease as molecular target,"Direct-acting antivirals are effective tools to control viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus associated with the epidemiological outbreak in late 2019. Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease. Based on that and using an in silico approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect. Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated. Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features. Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.","Ortega, Joseph Thomas; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Pujol, Flor Helene; Rangel, Hector Rafael",https://www.doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-1189,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081067/,PMC,10.17179/excli2020-1189,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17
19,"A Novel CDC42 Mutation in an 11-Year Old Child Manifesting as Syndromic Immunodeficiency, Autoinflammation, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, and Malignancy: A Case Report","Background: The CDC42 (Cell Division Cycle 42) gene product, CDC42, is a member of the family of small Rho GTPases, which are implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological functions in cell cycle regulation, including establishing and controlling of the cell actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, cell polarity, proliferation, motility and migration, transcription activation, reactive oxygen species production, and tumorigenesis. The CDC42 gene mutations are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental, growth, hematological, and immunological disturbances. Case presentation: We report the case of an 11-year-old boy with syndromic features, immunodeficiency, and autoinflammation who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and malignant lymphoproliferation. In this patient, a novel heterozygous p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene was found by whole exome sequencing. Conclusions: The Cdc42 molecule plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and a wide array of tissue-specific functions, and its deregulation may result in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular dysfunctions, making patients with CDC42 gene mutations susceptible to infections, immune dysregulation, and malignancy. In the patient studied, a syndromic phenotype with facial dysmorphism, neurodevelopmental delay, immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shares common features with Takenouchi–Kosaki syndrome and with C-terminal variants in CDC42. It is important to emphasize that Hodgkin's lymphoma is described for the first time in the medical literature in a pediatric patient with the novel p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene.

It is highly necessary for healthcare providers (HCPs) to have sufficient knowledge about such a disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge regarding ZIKV among HCPs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, KSA, during a two-month period from September 19, 2016 to November 19, 2016. Descriptive statistics were performed on data collected. For continuous variables, data were expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs), medians, and ranges. Proportions were used to describe categorical variables. Knowledge scores were evaluated and compared by demographic characteristics including age, designation, years of practice, and gender, using the t-test/Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 336 HCPs from different specialties (physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists) completed the questionnaire. Significant differences in knowledge about ZIKV were observed by participant's age. Significantly higher knowledge levels were observed among older participants (45 years or more; p=0.011). A substantial difference in the knowledge level was observed by department, with pairwise comparisons showing significant differences in knowledge scores between all departments except for Pharmacy vs. Nutrition and Nursing vs. Internal Medicine. Knowledge scores were not significantly different by years of practice. CONCLUSION: Our study showed inadequate knowledge of HCPs from different specialties about ZIKV infection which needs to be improved in terms of infection prevention and control. Awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and maintained among HCPs to face any possible emergence in the region.","Alessa, Mohammed; Alzahrani, Mohammed; Alshehri, Abdulmajeed; Aljrboa, Amjad; Bustami, Rami; Almangour, Abdullah; Alsalem, Abdulaziz; Gramish, Jawaher; Khobrani, Moteb; Almangour, Thamer A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/8145219,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086415/,PMC,10.1155/2020/8145219,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11
21,Clinical and Pathogenic Characteristics of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Treated at the Vietnam National Children's Hospital,"Lower respiratory tract infections are commonly caused by viruses and cause significant morbidity and mortality among children. Early identification of the pathological agent causing these infections is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and improve patient management. Multiplex PCR techniques were recently developed to detect multiple viral pathogens using a single PCR reaction. In this study, we identify viral pathogens in children with respiratory infections. We collected 194 nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants (2–24 months old) with lower respiratory tract infections treated at the Vietnam National Children's Hospital between November 2014 and June 2015 and assessed the presence of 16 virus types and subtypes by multiplex PCR using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) assay. Overall, 73.7% of the samples were positive for at least one virus, and 24.2% corresponded to infections with multiple viruses. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus. These viruses were more frequent among younger patients (2–5 months old) and caused symptoms similar to those of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The most common clinical manifestation caused by respiratory tract infection was bronchiolitis. Elevated neutrophils levels were associated with adenovirus infection. Our results showed that the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) can effectively detect multiple viruses causing respiratory infections in children and that the nasopharyngeal aspirates are a good sample choice to detect respiratory viruses in children. Applying this approach in the clinical setting would improve patient management and allow early diagnosis, thus avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","Pham, Hien T.; Nguyen, Phuc T.

22,Organoids as a Powerful Model for Respiratory Diseases,"Insults to the alveoli usually lead to inefficient gas exchange or even respiratory failure, which is difficult to model in animal studies. Over the past decade, stem cell-derived self-organizing three-dimensional organoids have emerged as a new avenue to recapitulate respiratory diseases in a dish. Alveolar organoids have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and pathological alterations in alveoli. From this perspective, we review the state-of-the-art technology on establishing alveolar organoids from endogenous lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells or pluripotent stem cells, as well as the use of alveolar organoids for the study of respiratory diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis infection, and respiratory virus infection. We also discuss challenges that need to be overcome for future application of alveolar organoids in individualized medicine.","Li, Yu; Wu, Qi; Sun, Xin; Shen, Jun; Chen, Huaiyong",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/5847876,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086445/,PMC,10.1155/2020/5847876,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

24,Tandem CTCF sites function as insulators to balance spatial chromatin contacts and topological enhancer-promoter selection,"BACKGROUND: CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem. RESULTS: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin “loop extrusion” model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.","Jia, Zhilian; Li, Jingwei; Ge, Xiao; Wu, Yonghu; Guo, Ya; Wu, Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-01984-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087399/,PMC,10.1186/s13059-020-01984-7,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation.

30,In Preparation for Outdoor Pharming: Griffithsin Can Be Expressed in Nicotiana excelsiana and Retains Activity After Storage as Silage,"Griffithsin is an algae-derived lectin with strong anti-viral activity against HIV and a positive safety profile. Multiple clinical studies are investigating griffithsin's utility as topical HIV microbicide. HIV microbicides are an extremely cost-sensitive market and plant-based griffithsin protein expression has the potential to meet those demands. The griffithsin product used in the clinic has been expressed and purified in N. benthamiana, using a TMV-based viral vector system, Geneware®. Outdoor pharming of biopharmaceuticals would further alleviate startup costs for biotechnology firms and may allow broader product accessibility. Therefore, this study assessed expression in a hybrid tobacco line, N. excelsiana, that is susceptible to TMV-based viral vectors and can be grown outdoors. In addition to using this hybrid line we expand on methods for in planta storage of griffithsin in leafy plants by ensiling kilogram quantities of griffithsin. The ensiling process allows year-round biomanufacturing, minimal environmental-controlled storage, and reduces the industry need for multiple growth areas to maintain multi-product manufacturing of plant-based pharmaceuticals. This study shows that griffithsin can be expressed in N. excelsiana and is stable, recoverable, and active from ensiled tissue. These studies can pave the way for future plant-based pharmaceuticals to be expressed and stored in this manner.","Eapen, Paul; Cates, Jennifer; Mundell, Rich; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Fuqua, Joshua L.",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00199,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093594/,PMC,10.3389/fbioe.2020.00199,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18
31,Nomogram for the Individualized Prediction of Survival Among Patients with H7N9 Infection,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, almost all of these studies have identified multiple risk factors but did not offer practical instruments for routine use in predicting individualized survival in human H7N9 infection cases. The objective of this study is to create a practical instrument for use in predicting an individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients. METHODS: A matched case–control study (1:2 ratios) was performed in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2019. We reviewed specific factors and outcomes regarding patients with H7N9 virus infection (VI) to determine relationships and developed a nomogram to calculate individualized survival probability. This tool was used to predict each individual patient’s probability of survival based on results obtained from the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: We examined 227 patients with H7N9 VI enrolled in our study. Stepwise selection was applied to the data, which resulted in a final model with 8 independent predictors [including initial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio ≤300 mmHg, age ≥60 years, chronic diseases, poor hand hygiene, time from illness onset to the first medical visit, incubation period ≤5 days, peak C-reactive protein ≥120 mg/L], and initial bilateral lung infection. The concordance index of this nomogram was 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.694–0.901] and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.611–0.952) for the training and validation sets, respectively, which indicates adequate discriminatory power. The calibration curves for the survival showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation in the training and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a novel nomogram that can accurately predict the survival probability of patients with H7N9 VI. This nomogram can serve an important role in counseling patients with H7N9 VI and guide treatment decisions.","Cheng, Qinglin; Sun, Zhou; Zhao, Gang; Xie, Li",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s242168,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094003/,PMC,10.2147/rmhp.s242168,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

33,Management of Adenoviral Keratoconjunctivitis: Challenges and Solutions,"Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, accounting for up to 75% of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics. In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.","Labib, Bisant A; Minhas, Bhawanjot K; Chigbu, DeGaulle I",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/opth.s207976,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094151/,PMC,10.2147/opth.s207976,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17
34,"Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Rationale for Their Utilization as Adjunctive Countermeasures in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates. Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well. Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an epiphenomenon of edema formation rather than coagulation activation. Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema. It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS. In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide. Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity. Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE. Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted. The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed. Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed. Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.","Solaimanzadeh, Isaac",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7343,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096066/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7343,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
35,Influence of interferon-based drugs on immunological indices in specific prevention,"AIM: The research aimed to study the effect of interferon (IFN)-based drugs on the behavior of immunological parameters in calves during the specific prevention of associative infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The object of research was 45 black motley cows and their calves from birth to 2 months of life. Serum and colostrum samples were screened for antibodies against Rotavirus, diarrhea, and coronavirus using serological methods. The testing was performed before vaccination, 40 days before calving, 20 days before calving, and before calving. Colostrum samples were taken during the first milk yield. Serum samples from calves were drawn before colostrum feeding as well as at 7, 14, and 21 days, and 1 and 2 months of age. To measure the level of immunoglobulins A, M, and G, additional serum samples were collected from calves at 25, 35, 65, and 75 days after birth. RESULTS: Giving pregnant cows, an IFN-based drug at a dose of 1 ml/kg 48 h before vaccination results in the development and accumulation of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, and viral diarrhea (VD) in the colostrum, with a titer of 7.6±0.3 log(2), 5.8±0.34 log(2), and 4.4±0.18 log(2), respectively. It indicates an increase in the antigenic activity of the multivalent vaccine. CONCLUSION: IFN-based drugs enhance the protective effect of vaccination against associative infections in the newborn calves. They stimulate a rise in the titer of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, VD, and mucosal disease complex as well as an increase in immunoglobulins A, M, and G.","Andreeva, Alfia; Nikolaeva, Oksana; Altynbekov, Oleg; Galieva, Chulpan; Ilina, Kseniia",https://www.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.238-244,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096290/,PMC,10.14202/vetworld.2020.238-244,10/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-10
36,Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of canine parvovirus circulating in Egypt,"AIM: This study aimed to detect and characterize current genotypes of canine parvovirus (CPV) in Egypt during 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277. Phylogenetic analysis of the Egyptian strains serotype 2b illustrated that they were closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers KP715709, KP715694, KP715701, and KP715700); while Egyptian strains serotype 2c was closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers MH711894 and MH711902), Taiwanese strain (KU244254), Chinese strain (MF467242), and Vietnamese strain (accession number LC216910). CONCLUSION: The current research recommends further epidemiological studies to assess the extent of the occurrence of different serotypes of CPV in Egypt and the efficiency of imported and locally produced vaccines in protection against CPV infection.","Zaher, Kawther Sayed; El-Dabae, Wahid Hussein; El-Sebelgy, Mostafa Mohamed; Aly, Naglaa Ibrahim; Salama, Zeinab Taha",https://www.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.326-333,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096306/,PMC,10.14202/vetworld.2020.326-333,19/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-19

40,Targeting the Endocytic Pathway and Autophagy Process as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy in COVID-19,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded positive genomic RNA viruses and some of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs. In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes.

Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.","Yi, Ye; Lagniton, Philip N.P.; Ye, Sen; Li, Enqin; Xu, Ren-He",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45134,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098028/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45134,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
42,Perspectives on therapeutic neutralizing antibodies against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","Zhou, Guangyu; Zhao, Qi",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45123,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098029/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45123,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
43,SARS-CoV-2: an Emerging Coronavirus that Causes a Global Threat,"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, we know little about it. In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus. Furthermore, we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2. We highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus, but their roles are waiting for further investigation. Finally, the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized.","Zheng, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45053,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098030/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45053,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
44,Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45472,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098031/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45472,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
45,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in clinical specimens and clinical characteristics of 10 patients with COVID-19 in Macau,"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","Lo, Iek Long; Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Cheong, Tak Hong; Zhong, Xu; Tian, Yakun; Sin, Nin Ngan",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45357,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098032/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45357,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15

47,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.","Zhong, Bao-Liang; Luo, Wei; Li, Hai-Mei; Zhang, Qian-Qian; Liu, Xiao-Ge; Li, Wen-Tian; Li, Yi",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45221,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098034/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45221,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
48,The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform,"Recently, more than 300 Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

We outlined major challenges for patients with psychiatric disorders and mental health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and also discussed how to manage these challenges through further mental health service reform in China.","Xiang, Yu-Tao; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Liu, Zi-Han; Li, Xiao-Hong; Zhao, Na; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H.",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45072,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098035/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45072,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
49,Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective,"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.","Yang, Yang; Islam, Md Sahidul; Wang, Jin; Li, Yuan; Chen, Xin",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45538,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098036/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45538,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
50,Progression of Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other Asian and European counterparts. This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control. The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services. In addition, mental health professionals and expert groups are stationed in designated isolation hospitals to provide on-site services. Experts have reached a consensus on the admission of patients with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 outbreak in mental health institutions. Nevertheless, the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 has emerged to mount a serious challenge to the mental health service in China.","Li, Wen; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qinge; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45120,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098037/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45120,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
51,Infants Born to Mothers With a New Coronavirus (COVID-19),"A novel viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cases in China and worldwide. Four full-term, singleton infants were born to pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, where the disease was first identified. Of the three infants, for who consent to be diagnostically tested was provided, none tested positive for the virus. None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence, and all four infants were alive at the time of hospital discharge. Two infants had rashes of unknown etiology at birth, and one had facial ulcerations. One infant had tachypnea and was supported by non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days. One had rashes at birth but was discharged without parental consent for a diagnostic test. This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants, born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Yan; Peng, Hua; Wang, Lin; Zhao, Yin; Zeng, Lingkong; Gao, Hui; Liu, Yalan",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00104,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098456/,PMC,10.3389/fped.2020.00104,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16
52,C-X-C Motif Chemokine 10 Contributes to the Development of Neuropathic Pain by Increasing the Permeability of the Blood–Spinal Cord Barrier,"Neuropathic pain is among the most debilitating forms of chronic pain. Studies have suggested that chronic pain pathogenesis involves neuroimmune interactions and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We modeled neuropathic pain in rats by inducing chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and analyzed the effects on C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/CXCR3 activation, BSCB permeability, and immune cell migration from the circulation into the spinal cord. We detected CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons and observed that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 activation, BSCB disruption, and mechanical hyperalgesia. CCI-induced BSCB disruption enabled circulating T cells to migrate into the spinal parenchyma. Intrathecal administration of an anti-CXCL10 antibody not only attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia, but also reduced BSCB permeability, suggesting that CXCL10 acts as a key regulator of BSCB integrity. Moreover, T cell migration may play a critical role in the neuroimmune interactions involved in the pathogenesis of CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Our results highlight CXCL10 as a new potential drug target for the treatment of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.","Li, Hao-Ling; Huang, Yan; Zhou, Ya-Lan; Teng, Run-Hua; Zhou, Shu-Zhuan; Lin, Jia-Piao; Yang, Yan; Zhu, Sheng-Mei; Xu, Hua; Yao, Yong-Xing",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00477,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098954/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00477,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
53,A Precision Medicine Approach to Rhinitis Evaluation and Management,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The PM approach focuses on the characterization of different phenotypes and pathogenic pathways in order to allow the selection of specific biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Rhinitis is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disease, both in terms of underlying endotypes and clinical presentations. Therefore, to apply the PM principles to the various rhinitis subtypes rise as a meaningful strategy to improve evaluation and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The technology of recombinant allergens has allowed molecular characterization of IgE reactivity of specific individual components of allergenic extracts. Recently published and ongoing clinical trials based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD) bring more precision to allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines involved in inflammatory allergic and nonallergic rhinitis endotypes show promissory results. SUMMARY: Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with rhinitis symptoms contributes to point out clinical usefulness of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which leads to more accurate environmental control measures, personalized pharmacologic options, and new biological therapy developments.","Crisci, Carlos D.; Ardusso, Ledit R.

63,Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China,"Universal health coverage (UHC) is driving the global health agenda. Many countries have embarked on national policy reforms towards this goal, including China. In 2009, the Chinese government launched a new round of healthcare reform towards UHC, aiming to provide universal coverage of basic healthcare by the end of 2020. The year of 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of China’s most recent healthcare reform. Sharing China’s experience is especially timely for other countries pursuing reforms to achieve UHC. This study describes the social, economic and health context in China, and then reviews the overall progress of healthcare reform (1949 to present), with a focus on the most recent (2009) round of healthcare reform. The study comprehensively analyses key reform initiatives and major achievements according to four aspects: health insurance system, drug supply and security system, medical service system and public health service system.

68,KCDC Risk Assessments on the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the risk assessments of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), from the point of detection to the provision of basic information to the relevant public health authorities. METHODS: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. RESULTS: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8(th) to February 28(th), 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: “low” (first), “moderate” (second), “high” (third), “high” (fourth), “high” (fifth), “high” (sixth), “high” (seventh), and “very high” (eighth). CONCLUSION: The KCDC’s 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.","Kim, Inho; Lee, Jia; Lee, Jihee; Shin, Eensuk; Chu, Chaeshin; Lee, Seon Kui",https://www.doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.02,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104687/,PMC,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.02,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

70,Cross-Country Comparison of Case Fatality Rates of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2,"OBJECTIVES: Case fatality rates (CFR) and recovery rates are important readouts during epidemics and pandemics. In this article, an international analysis was performed on the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Data were retrieved from accurate databases according to the user’s guide of data sources for patient registries, CFR and recovery rates were calculated for each country. A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases ≥ 1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. RESULTS: Italy’s CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%). The data showed that even though Italy was the only European country reported on 12(rd) March, Spain and France had the highest CFR of 6.16 and 4.21%, respectively, on 23(rd) March, which was strikingly higher than the overall CFR of 3.61%. CONCLUSION: Obtaining detailed and accurate medical history from COVID-19 patients, and analyzing CFR alongside the recovery rate, may enable the identification of the highest risk areas so that efficient medical care may be provided. This may lead to the development of point-of-care tools to help clinicians in stratifying patients based on possible requirements in the level of care, to increase the probabilities of survival from COVID-19 disease.","Khafaie, Morteza Abdullatif; Rahim, Fakher",https://www.doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104689/,PMC,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
71,"The experience of high-flow nasal cannula in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in two hospitals of Chongqing, China","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China. Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1–2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25–29) vs. 23 (22–25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO(2)/FiO(2) significantly improved after 1–2 h of NIV [median 172 (150–208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79–130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) were more likely to experience HFNC failure.","Wang, Ke; Zhao, Wei; Li, Ji; Shu, Weiwei; Duan, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104710/,PMC,10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
72,Microbial burden and viral exacerbations in a longitudinal multicenter COPD cohort,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent exacerbation phenotypes independent of disease stage. Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota plays a role in disease progression and severity, but long-term and international multicenter assessment of the variations in viral and bacterial communities as drivers of exacerbations are lacking. METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P < 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P < 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event. Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR > 0.17; P < 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency (OR > 0.39; P < 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights bacterial taxa in lung sensitization and viral triggers in COPD exacerbations. It provides a global overview of the diverse targets for drug development and explores new microbiome analysis methods to guide future patient management applications.","Bouquet, Jerome; Tabor, David E.; Silver, Jonathan S.; Nair, Varsha; Tovchigrechko, Andrey; Griffin, M.

73,Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment,"The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants’ clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","Rosa, Sandro G.

74,COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?,"Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is paramount. There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review aimed to collate information available in published articles to identify any evidence behind these claims with the aim of advising clinicians on how best to treat patients. This review found no published evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if utilised in the early acute phase of infection, however, conflicting evidence from the World Health Organisation surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. Given the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105332/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
75,Associations between immune-suppressive and stimulating drugs and novel COVID-19—a systematic review of current evidence,"BACKGROUND: Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs. This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. RESULTS: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; George, Gincy; Santaolalla, Aida; Cope, Andrew; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105343/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
76,A GMC Oxidoreductase GmcA Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae,"GmcA is a FAD-containing enzyme belonging to the GMC (glucose-methanol-choline oxidase) family of oxidoreductases. A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H(2)O(2) conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity. Moreover, nine proteins related to amino acid metabolism were over-expressed.","Zou, Qian; Luo, Sha; Wu, Hetao; He, Donglan; Li, Xiaohua; Cheng, Guojun",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00394,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105596/,PMC,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00394,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
77,Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Expressing M1-HA2 Fusion Protein Provides Protective Mucosal Immunity Against H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Chickens,"H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.","Sha, Zhou; Shang, Hongqi; Miao, Yongqiang; Huang, Jin; Niu, Xiangyun; Chen, Ruichang; Hu, Liping; Huang, He; Wei, Kai; Zhu, Ruiliang",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00153,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105734/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00153,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
78,Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus Induces Cell-cycle Arrest through the DNA Damage-signalling Pathway,"INTRODUCTION: Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) infection causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss, especially among neonatal piglets, inflicting on them morbidity and mortality potentially reaching 90%–100%. Despite it being known that certain mammalian cell phases are arrested by PEDV, the mechanisms have not been elucidated, and PEDV pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study determined the effect of an epidemic PEDV strain on cell cycle progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We observed the effect of the PEDV SHpd/2012 strain on an infected Vero cell cycle through flow cytometry and Western blot, investigating the interrelationships of cell-cycle arrest, the DNA damage–signalling pathway caused by PEDV and the phosphorylation levels of the key molecules Chk.2 and H2A.X involved upstream and downstream in this pathway. RESULTS: PEDV induced Vero cell-cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase. The phosphorylation levels of Chk.2 and H2A.X increased with the prolongation of PEDV infection, and no significant cell-cycle arrest was observed after treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. The proliferation of PEDV was also inhibited by treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: PEDV-induced cell-cycle arrest is associated with activation of DNA damage–signalling pathways. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis of PEDV replication and provide evidence to support further evaluation of PEDV pathogenesis.","Luo, Yi-Ran; Zhou, Shu-Ting; Yang, Liang; Liu, Yuan-Ping; Jiang, Sheng-Yao; Dawuli, Yeliboli; Hou, Yi-Xuan; Zhou, Tian-Xing; Yang, Zhi-Biao",https://www.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2020-0024,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105999/,PMC,10.2478/jvetres-2020-0024,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential.

AIMS: This aim of the study is to assess the bacterial and fungal presence and their prevalence over the contaminated surgical mask in dental practice. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was conducted with sample size 240 used surgical masks collected from 130 dental personnel. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with analysis involved inoculation of external and internal surfaces in an enrichment media for isolation of bacteria and fungi. Group of isolated bacteria and fungi were preliminarily identified by morphology and using Gram's stain and lacto-phenol cotton blue mediums. Data were analyzed using paired t-test; the significant level of P < 0.050. RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of samples revealed bacteria Staphylococci 26.35% as a predominant species followed by Pseudomonas 17.82% and Streptococci 15.50%. Aspergillus fungal species was also present in 6.97%. Mean ± SD of bacterial and fungal contamination on inside/outside area of the used masks was 48 ± 26 and 180 ± 110 cfu/ml/piece and 14 ± 6 and 32 ± 13 cfu/ml/piece, respectively, P < 0.001. The used surgical masks from dental department personnel working outpatient dental department had relatively higher bacterial and fungal contamination than the other dental departments. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce a load of microorganism contamination in the clinical environment, more awareness campaigns should be implemented in daily routine and air quality of dental departments should be improved with necessary protective measures.","Sachdev, Rohan; Garg, Kriti; Singh, Garima; Mehrotra, Vishal",https://www.doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1039_19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113990/,PMC,10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1039_19,28/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-28
94,Antibacterial Activity of Chitosan-Based Systems,"Chitosan and its derivatives can be called environmental purification functional materials as they can effectively control the growth and reproduction of hazardous bacteria and also control toxic pollutants. From the basic science to the latest developments and innovations, starting with the history of the material, this chapter presents a facile way to understand the antibacterial activity of the chitosan, together with other materials, to the reader.

97,Drug repurposing strategies for COVID-19,"COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic and new treatments are urgently needed as we enter a phase beyond containment. Developing new drugs from scratch is a lengthy process, thus impractical to face the immediate global challenge. Drug repurposing is an emerging strategy where existing medicines, having already been tested safe in humans, are redeployed to combat difficult-to-treat diseases. While using such repurposed drugs individually may ultimately not yield a significant clinical benefit, carefully combined cocktails could be very effective, as was for HIV in the 1990s; the urgent question now being which combination.","Senanayake, Suranga L",https://www.doi.org/10.4155/fdd-2020-0010,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117595/,PMC,10.4155/fdd-2020-0010,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

101,Vasculitis,"Vasculitis, characterized by inflammation and necrosis, manifests a wide spectrum of presentation by involving a vasculature of various sizes and locations. A definitive diagnosis of vasculitis invariably requires histologic confirmation since there are no diagnostic clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings. The most widely adopted vasculitis classification is the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature of systemic vasculitis which integrated clinical symptoms, histopathologic features, and laboratory findings. This classification accounts for the size of the involved vessels. This chapter outlines the clinical and histologic features of the small-vessel vasculitis including the immune complex vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; medium-vessel vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease; large-vessel vasculitis, namely, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis; variable-vessel vasculitis such as Behcet disease and Cogan syndrome; and vasculitis associated with systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus vasculitis, and sarcoid vasculitis. Vasculitis can also be secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma. Therefore, a diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be based on histologic ground alone. Clinical pathologic correlation is necessary.","Hoang, Mai P.; Park, Joonsoo",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35820-4_7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120156/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35820-4_7,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
102,Pneumonia Caused by Emerging Viral Agents,"Emerging viruses that cause pneumonia in humans are agents which normally circulate in the animal population but can move to human hosts under certain circumstances, which determines the occurrence of a new type of disease. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a coronavirus. The disease has a wide symptomatic spectrum that can range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant respiratory failure. Diagnostic confirmation is achieved through viral isolation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also produced by a coronavirus, is capable of producing a serious pulmonary disease outbreak with no reappearance. The clinical presentation includes fever, malaise, cough, and headache followed by diarrhea. Other coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) can cause serious lower respiratory infections in small children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed patients. Influenza virus is widespread in nature, and avian virus may spread to humans, as has been reported with H7N9, H5N1, H10N8, and H6N1. Cardiopulmonary hantavirus syndrome, a feverish disease characterized by respiratory insufficiency and shock, is produced by Andes virus. Other emerging viruses are enterovirus D68 and polyomavirus.","Perret Pérez, Cecilia; Ferrés Garrido, Marcela",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_34,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120232/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_34,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
103,Blood Transfusion-Associated Infections in the Twenty-First Century: New Challenges,"Blood transfusions are vital components of modern medical treatment to which there is no viable alternative despite efforts to create artificial blood. Each year thousands of lives are saved by blood transfusions in every country of the world. However, blood and blood products can result in significant adverse events including immunologic reactions, infections, inefficacy, and others which can sometimes result in death and severe disability. Thus, the sustainability of safe blood systems and costs are considered to be at crisis level. In industrialized countries, the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections such as HIV, syphilis, hepatitis viruses B and C are very low [generally [<1 in a million units], but in developing countries [especially in Africa] blood safety is still not assured. Compounding the problem of blood/product safety with respect to infectious agents are new emerging infectious microbes that are not being routinely tested for in blood that are donated. This chapter reviews the infectious risk of blood transfusions, types, mode and geographic variation, and the methods being used by blood services to attenuate and prevent these risks.","Fong, I.

This chapter reviews triage practices, including early isolation and decontamination, of highly infectious diseases and bioterrorism agents at different health system levels.","Bezek, Sarah; Jaung, Michael; Mackey, Joy",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120388/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_3,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
105,Malaria,"Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and environmental changes are likely to increase its importance in the coming years. Diagnosing this disease is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in non-endemic countries. Critical care providers play a major role in treating severe malaria and its complications, which has management particularities that might not be readily apparent. Fluid resuscitation should be carefully tailored to avoid complications, and dysperfusion seems more related to degree of parasitemia than hypovolemia. Antimalarial agents are effective, but resistance is growing. Complications can be found in nearly every organ, including cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury. As such, a critical care unit is frequently required for organ support when they appear. Superimposed infections are not infrequent. Despite all of this, mortality is encouragingly low with a timely diagnosis and access to appropriate treatment.","Hidalgo, Jorge; Arriaga, Pedro; Concejo, Bruno Alvarez",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120402/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_13,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
106,Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Community-acquired pneumonia is an infection of the small airways and pulmonary parenchyma that develops in the outpatient setting. Despite the development of new antibiotics and vaccines, pneumonia is still a disease that occurs frequently in children under 5 years of age and is one of the main causes of mortality, especially in developing countries. The biggest challenge in treating pneumonia is to determine the agent, which depends on age, disease severity, immunological condition, geographic location, epidemiological situation, and immunizations. The classic clinical picture presents with fever, coughing, and difficulty in breathing. The physical examination shows tachypnea, reduced breath sounds, and fine crackles. Wheezing may be present in infants with viral pneumonia. The chest X-ray is considered an important tool to confirm the disease diagnosis and may guide specific treatment. Acute-phase reactants have a low sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between virus and bacteria. Microbiological identification does not have a clinical impact for most children with community-acquired pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be considered for immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic treatment is empirical based on the best possible etiology, depending on the patient’s age and epidemiological timing. Amoxicillin is the treatment of choice for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and azithromycin is preferred for Mycoplasma pneumoniae.","Boza Costagliola, María Lina",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120449/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_31,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01

A surveillance program implemented a decade ago has allow pediatricians to improve the diagnostic yield on a regular basis.","Avendaño Carvajal, Luis; Perret Pérez, Cecilia",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120591/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_28,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
110,"Influenza, Measles, SARS, MERS, and Smallpox","Influenza, measles, SARS, MERS, and smallpox illnesses are caused by highly infectious viral pathogens that induce critical illness. These biologically diverse viruses enter and replicate within host cells triggering viral- and host-mediated damage that results in pneumonia and multiorgan failure in severe cases. Early case identification and strict infection control limit healthcare transmission. Vaccination allowed smallpox eradication and limits global measles and seasonal influenza mortality. While SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is no longer circulating, MERS-CoV and zoonotic influenza viruses, with pandemic potential, remain persistent threats. Supportive critical care is the mainstay of treatment for severe disease due to these viral infections.","Chertow, Daniel S.; Kindrachuk, Jason",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120728/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_5,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
111,Sickle Cell Disease,"Sickle cell disease is characterized by vaso-occlusive and hemolysis events that may occur in a variable range of clinical presentations. Patients with this disease, particularly with acute chest syndrome, suffer acute episodes of chest pain caused by vaso-occlusive crisis, that tend to repeat, especially under the influence of lower respiratory infections, dehydration, and any cause of hypoxemia. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease must be periodically evaluated through oximetry, lung function tests, sleep study, and echocardiograms to detect obstructive and restrictive diseases that frequently worsens the lung condition. Asthma and sleep disorders contribute to morbidity and must be controlled.","Álvarez, Ofelia; Wietstruck, María Angélica",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_52,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120761/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_52,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
112,The Impact and Control of Emerging and Re-Emerging Viral Diseases in the Environment: An African Perspective,"Emerging viral infections (EVI), and re-emergent variants of existing ones, are a growing threat to public health worldwide with outbreaks occurring sporadically especially in Africa associated with significant adverse ecological, socioeconomic and public health implications. These pathogens have devised evolved environmental adaptations, including the possession of genomic resistance mutations. Haemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses and respiratory pathogens like the avian and human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, most from zoonotic reservoirs, may significantly increase morbidity and mortality in the human population in the nearest future. Likewise, vector-borne zoonotic viral diseases including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile, transmitted by arthropods from animal reservoirs, occur frequently in the tropics, exhibiting previously unseen patterns of infection and spread. These patterns are facilitated by many intrinsic factors like mutated sites in the viral genome, and external factors including urbanization, displacement, human migration and climate change. Emerging viruses can easily cross boundaries and pose severe threats to the human populations in new geographical areas. Here, we outline the features of common emergent viruses and factors facilitating their emergence, effects, control and sustained management in the environment.","Shenge, Juliet Adamma; Opayele, Adewale Victor",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35296-7_7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120784/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35296-7_7,05/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-05
113,Issues in Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is one of the most commonly diagnosed infectious diseases and is the third most frequent cause of death worldwide. Accurate statistics of community-acquired pneumonia incidence globally or in countries of various regions are lacking. Although the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is not difficult, the etiology diagnosis to guide targeted specific antimicrobial therapy still poses a challenge even with novel molecular methods. This has led to different approaches and guidelines for the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, often with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents which may play a role in fostering the worldwide development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Severe community-acquired pneumonia, seen mainly at the extremes of age and in persons with chronic underlying diseases, is associated with high mortality of 20–40%. Pneumonia severity tools, such as CURB-65, have been developed over the past decade to assist emergency department physicians to recognize, admit, and implement rapid antimicrobial therapy in severely ill patients. The evidence for the beneficial effects of these tools will be reviewed in this chapter. Issues in the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia that are discussed include: combination with newer macrolides [irrespective of microbial etiology], value of adjunctive therapy such as corticosteroids and statins.","Fong, I.

114,Concerns and Threats of Contamination on Aquatic Ecosystems,"Aquatic ecosystems are the ultimate sinks for the contaminants. Water contamination is the outcome of human activities such as urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural activities. The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers and sewage from residential and industrial areas ultimately find its way to aquatic environment. Thus results in the degradation of the water quality and leads to the spread of infectious diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and jaundice. Contamination in aquatic environs is one of the leading types of pollution which has significant negative health issues and mortality. Water has a natural capacity to neutralize the contamination, but when contamination becomes uncontrolled, water will lose its self-generating capacity. Therefore, there is a need for regular monitoring and controlling of pollutant discharge into the nearby aquatic environs.","Bashir, Ishrat; Lone, F.

115,Flourishing,"Being part of, or witnessing, a terrible disaster is clearly very distressing. How do we minimize this kind of distress and continue to flourish in the future as we face extreme climate events such as wildfires and flooding? How do we identify and learn from past events lying hidden, unrecognized and unforeseen as failure incubated? What are the global ‘grand challenges’—both natural and man-made? What are the UN Sustainable Development Goals? To achieve them do we need to reverse the fragmentation of the professions into ‘silos’? What is ‘joined-up’ thinking in ‘joined-up’ organisations and nation states and how important is it? Despite all the advances in science, we know less actually than we think we know. Contingency planning that expects surprises must be the new norm. Learn anew how to learn together is the new wisdom. Use the golden rule ‘do not do to others that you would not have them do to you’, whatever you are told to believe, is our tenet. Behaviour is more important than belief—imperfect doing is better than uncertain knowing. But to do all of this collectively requires leadership that we can trust—perhaps the biggest challenge of all?","Blockley, David",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38257-5_9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121705/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-38257-5_9,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01

118,Acute and Chronic Infection Management in CF,"CFTR protein malfunction results in thick, copious mucus, causes poor mucociliary clearance and, ultimately, structural lung damage such as bronchiectasis. All of these manifestations of cystic fibrosis contribute to a rich milieu for lower respiratory pathogens in patients affected by the disease. CF patients are, therefore, highly susceptible to chronic colonization with many pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They are also uniquely prone to acute infections with respiratory pathogens, which tend to persist longer and cause more impairment in lung function than in patients without CF. Tailored strategies for managing infectious complications of CF patients include chronic prophylactic antibiotics, use of systemic as well as inhaled antibiotics, mechanical assistance with mucus clearance, and scrupulous infection control measures.","Allen, Patrick; Borick, Joseph; Borick, Jamie",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-25909-9_8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121858/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-25909-9_8,29/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-29
119,"Zoonotic Infections and Biowarfare Agents in Critical Care: Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia","Bacterial zoonotic infections are rare in developed countries in the twenty-first century but may cause major morbidity and mortality in developing regions of the world. In addition, their potential use as biological weapons makes early recognition and effective empiric therapy important for the critical care practitioner. Anthrax, plague, and tularemia share overlapping presenting syndromes, including fulminant respiratory infections and less severe but still highly morbid lymphocutaneous infections. Although all three may be transmitted as infectious aerosols, only plague has a risk of direct human-to-human transmission. Diagnostic testing will require special precautions for laboratory staff and most often involvement of regional and national reference laboratories. Empiric therapy with aminoglycosides may be life-saving for plague and tularemia, while the treatment of anthrax is complex and varies depending on the site of infection. In outbreaks or for post-exposure prophylaxis, treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone is recommended for all three diseases.","Maves, Ryan C.; Berjohn, Catherine M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122055/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_6,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
120,Arguing from Ignorance,"It might seem that it can never be rational to argue from a state of ignorance. But this is not the case. Ignorance arguments abound in our everyday thinking such as when we conclude that a train does not stop in York because York is not listed in the timetable. These arguments also tend to be the first line of defence when the safety of food or prescribed medications is called into question. The statement ‘There is no evidence that beef is unsafe’, which is a premise in an ignorance argument, was used so extensively by health officials and government ministers during the BSE epidemic in the UK that it came to be called the mantra of the BSE affair by the public inquiry into the epidemic. A similar ignorance premise is often used to frame the conclusion of systematic reviews into the effectiveness of a particular medical or health intervention. This chapter examines the various purposes for which ignorance arguments are advanced in medicine and health and considers the epistemic conditions under which these arguments are more or less rationally warranted.","Cummings, Louise",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-28513-5_2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122285/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-28513-5_2,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01
121,Nanomaterial Effects on Viral Infection,"The potential for environmental and occupational exposures of populations to nanomaterials (NMs) has fostered concerns of associated adverse health effects, with a particular emphasis on pulmonary injury and disease. Many studies have revealed that several types of NMs can evoke a variety of biological responses, such as pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to allergy, fibrosis, and granuloma formation. Less attention has been paid to health effects that may result from exposure to NMs and additional stressors such as pathogens, with a particular focus on susceptibility to viral infection. This chapter will summarize the current body of literature related to NMs and viral exposures with a primary focus on immune modulation. A summary of the studies performed and major findings to date will be discussed, highlighting proposed molecular mechanisms behind NM-driven host susceptibility, challenges, limitations, and future research needs. Specific mechanisms discussed include direct interaction between NMs and biological molecules, activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and related signaling pathways, production of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and modulation of lipid signaling networks.","Chen, Hao; Humes, Sara T.; Saleh, Navid B.; Lednicky, John A.; Sabo-Attwood, Tara",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33962-3_10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122331/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33962-3_10,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31
122,Genetic Basis of Myocarditis: Myth or Reality?,"The genetic basis of myocarditis remains an intriguing concept, at least as long as the definition of myocarditis constitutes the definitive presence of myocardial inflammation sufficient to cause the observed ventricular dysfunction in the setting of cardiotropic infections. Autoimmune or immune-mediated myocardial inflammation constitutes a complex area of clinical interest, wherein numerous and not yet fully understood role of hereditary auto-inflammatory diseases can result in inflammation of the pericardium and myocardium. Finally, myocardial involvement in hereditary immunodeficiency diseases, cellular and humoral, is a possible trigger for infections which may complicate the diseases themselves. Whether the role of constitutional genetics can make the patient susceptible to myocardial inflammation remains yet to be explored.","Arbustini, Eloisa; Narula, Nupoor; Giuliani, Lorenzo; Di Toro, Alessandro",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35276-9_4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122345/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35276-9_4,07/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-07

125,Porcine Coronaviruses,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) are enteropathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) of swine. TGEV appearance in 1946 preceded identification of PEDV (1971) and PDCoV (2009) that are considered as emerging CoVs. A spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in Belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical. Since PRCV emergence and rapid spread, most pigs have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. In contrast, PDCoV and PEDV are currently expanding their geographic distribution, and there are reports on the circulation of TGEV-PEDV recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs (most severe in neonatal piglets) and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis. Necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea. Profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration, which can lead to the death of piglets. Strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge; however, these viruses display no cross-protection. Adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated CoVs. Recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field.","Vlasova, A.

126,Sapelovirus,"Sapelovirus (SPV), an emerging virus in the family Picornaviridae, is detected in several animal and bird species irrespective of their age. Amid all SPVs, porcine sapeloviruses (PSVs) are more ubiquitously present all over the world in porcine population. These viruses are highly stable in different environmental conditions and spread easily within the susceptible animals mainly through faeco-oral route. Usually, PSVs cause asymptomatic infections but are also clinically associated with encephalomyelitis, respiratory distress, fertility disorders and skin lesions. PSV-associated outbreaks have been reported where death occurs due to polioencephalitis and respiratory paralysis. Till date, PSVs have been detected from several European and Asian countries with moderate-to-high prevalence and clinical course. Viral capsid proteins are immunogenic and mutations in these proteins are responsible for the diverse nature of the viruses. Further, genomic analysis shows the varied evolutionary patterns and the presence of recombination within PSV strains. These viruses also exist as concurrent infections with several enteric bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Classical to modern biotechnological assays are in use to detect PSV involving virus isolation in cell culture, immunohistochemistry, conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques, quantitative real-time amplification assays and isothermal amplification molecular techniques. Till date, there is no vaccine available against PSVs.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123037/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_14,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23

128,Teschovirus,"Teschoviruses are emerging pathogens, belonging to the family Picornaviridae, and infects porcine population only. Among all, porcine teschoviruses (PTVs) are of high prominence leading to clinical illness and consequent economic loss to the livestock sector. These are associated with extremely lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis (Teschen disease) and are distributed world over. Its milder form, Talfan disease, inflicts low morbidity and mortality and general clinical disease. The first epizootics of Teschen disease occurred in 1929 in the Czech Republic. Mature virions are small (23–30 nm) and stable in environmental conditions (pH range 2–9, heat, lipid solvents). Genetic variations in the major surface protein, VP1, lead to the evolution of several new types. As of now, 13 genotypes in PTV are approved, namely PTV-1–13. Among all, PTV-1 is highly virulent and causes severe mortality and morbidity in the porcine population, domestic as well as wild. Ingestion is the main spreading route of infection, though intra-nasal infection and virus secretion in the urine are also noted. Along with encephalitis, PTVs are also responsible for reproductive disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pericarditis and myocarditis. PTVs are also found as co-infection with several bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Several conventional and modern diagnostics tools are available for their detection. Alternative of serological typing, VP1 and VP2 gene-based molecular typing is now preferred to know the epidemiological pattern. Although initially vaccines were used for its eradication in Europe, due to the sporadic reports of mild PTV infection in several countries, the approach was discontinued. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple serotypes, developing a multivalent PTV vaccine to protect against all strains is a major challenge.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123469/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_6,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23

Examples of big data include weather data, web-search data, disease reports, as well as epidemic data and statistics. These big data can be easily generated and collected from a wide variety of data sources. A data science framework—such as predictive analytics framework—helps mining data from various big data sources to find useful information and discover knowledge, which can then be transformed into wisdom for appropriate actions. In this paper, we present an innovative big data predictive analytics framework over hybrid big data sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our framework, we conduct several case studies, including one on applying the framework to disease analytics. More specifically, we integrate, incorporate and analyze weather data and web-search data to predict and forecast dengue cases based on a hybrid of three kernels in support vector machine (SVM) ensemble. Results show how our predictive analytics framework benefits health agencies in disease control and prevention.","Souza, Joglas; Leung, Carson K.; Cuzzocrea, Alfredo",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44041-1_59,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123615/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-44041-1_59,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
131,Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viral Diseases: Perspectives and Preparedness,"The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife–human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and ‘spill-over’ and ‘spill-back’; and technology and industry for domestic animal–human EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management. This chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important TADs and EIDs along with the successes, constraints, limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches.","Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar; Malik, Yashpal Singh",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123659/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_1,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23
132,"Phyllospheric Microbiomes: Diversity, Ecological Significance, and Biotechnological Applications","The phyllosphere referred to the total aerial plant surfaces (above-ground portions), as habitat for microorganisms. Microorganisms establish compositionally complex communities on the leaf surface. The microbiome of phyllosphere is rich in diversity of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, and viruses. The diversity, dispersal, and community development on the leaf surface are based on the physiochemistry, environment, and also the immunity of the host plant. A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment. To the scientific advancement, several molecular techniques like metagenomics and metaproteomics have been used to study and understand the physiology and functional relationship of microbes to the host and its environment. Based on the available information, this chapter describes the basic understanding of microbiome in leaf structure and physiology, microbial interactions, especially bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, and their adaptation in the phyllosphere environment. Further, the detailed information related to the importance of the microbiome in phyllosphere to the host plant and their environment has been analyzed.

133,Investigation into SARS-CoV-2 Resistance of Compounds in Garlic Essential Oil,"[Image: see text] Eighteen active substances, including 17 organosulfur compounds found in garlic essential oil (T), were identified by GC–MS analysis. For the first time, using the molecular docking technique, we report the inhibitory effect of the considered compounds on the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in the human body that leads to a crucial foundation about coronavirus resistance of individual compounds on the main protease (PDB6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that the 17 organosulfur compounds, accounting for 99.4% contents of the garlic essential oil, have strong interactions with the amino acids of the ACE2 protein and the main protease PDB6LU7 of SARS-CoV-2. The strongest anticoronavirus activity is expressed in allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which account for the highest content in the garlic essential oil (51.3%). Interestingly, docking results indicate the synergistic interactions of the 17 substances, which exhibit good inhibition of the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins. The results suggest that the garlic essential oil is a valuable natural antivirus source, which contributes to preventing the invasion of coronavirus into the human body.","Thuy, Bui Thi Phuong; My, Tran Thi Ai; Hai, Nguyen Thi Thanh; Hieu, Le Trung; Hoa, Tran Thai; Thi Phuong Loan, Huynh; Triet, Nguyen Thanh; Anh, Tran Thi Van; Quy, Phan Tu; Tat, Pham Van; Hue, Nguyen Van; Quang, Duong Tuan; Trung, Nguyen Tien; Tung, Vo Thanh; Huynh, Lam K.; Nhung, Nguyen Thi Ai",https://www.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c00772,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123907/,PMC,10.1021/acsomega.0c00772,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

136,When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: A SEIR modeling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. METHOD: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. RESULTS: The optimal parameters were estimated as R(0) = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly. It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.","Wan, Kangkang; Chen, Jing; Lu, Changming; Dong, Lanlan; Wu, Zhicheng; Zhang, Lianglu",https://www.doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.011002,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125416/,PMC,10.7189/jogh.10.011002,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
137,An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19,"BACKGROUND: On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. METHODS: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. RESULTS: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.","Harris, Carlyn; Carson, Gail; Baillie, J Kenneth; Horby, Peter; Nair, Harish",https://www.doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10-011001,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125419/,PMC,10.7189/jogh.10-011001,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

139,The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN e-Health Intervention to improve patient activation and self-management behaviours among individuals with Metabolic Syndrome in primary care: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies conducted in various parts of the world have clearly demonstrated that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an increasing global health problem, not only in Western societies but also in Asian populations. Web-based and mobile phone-based self-management applications have been proven to be effective in improving self-management behaviour of patients with MetS components (i.e., diabetes or hypertension). However, evidence is lacking in terms of their effectiveness specifically for patients with MetS. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention in improving activation and self-management behaviours among patients with MetS. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a university primary care clinic. A total of 232 patients aged 18–60 years with MetS will be recruited; 116 will be randomised to receive the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention for 6 months, and another 116 patients will continue with usual care. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention is a multifaceted chronic disease management strategy based on the Chronic Care Model and persuasive technology theory. It consists of training primary care physicians, nurses and patients to use the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN web-based self-management mobile app, strengthening the patient–physician relationship and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines to guide management and prescribing. The primary outcome is the mean change in patient activation score using the Patient Activation Measure short form Malay version (PAM-13-M) questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include the changes in waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, patient physical activity level, eating behaviour, perception of chronic illness care, satisfaction with patient–physician interaction, and perceived absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. Feasibility of implementing the intervention will be evaluated. This includes acceptability of the intervention, estimating the likely rate of participant recruitment and retention, appropriateness of the outcome measures, calculation of sample size, and the intervention’s potential effectiveness. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Malaysia that aims to determine the feasibility of a multifaceted e-health intervention, as well as to indicate more useful aspects of this intervention for further exploration in a larger trial.

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19.

However, the high turnover of village doctors, both individually and collectively, threaten the stability of village medical teams. This research evaluated the influence of job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement on the village doctors’ turnover intention, and explored the mediating role of work engagement and resilience between job satisfaction and the turnover intention of village doctors in China. METHODS: A quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire containing mostly structured items was conducted among village doctors with a sample size of 2693 from 1345 rural clinics in Shandong province, China, during May and June 2019. All variables including demographic characteristics, job satisfaction, resilience, work engagement and turnover intention were based on available literature, and measured on a 5- or 6-point Likert scale. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used. RESULTS: Up to 46.9% of the subjects had a higher turnover intention and more than 26.3% of them had a medium turnover intention. The job satisfaction of village doctors could not only have a direct negative effect on turnover intention (β = − 0.37, p < 0.001), but also have an indirect effect through work engagement (β = − 0.04,=< 0.001). Meanwhile, work engagement also had a direct negative impact on turnover intention (β = − 0.13, p < 0.001), and resilience had an indirect negative impact on turnover intention through work engagement (β = − 0.09, p < 0.001). The above results of this study strongly confirmed that job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement were early, powerful predicators of village doctors’ turnover intention. CONCLUSION: According to the results, the following should be taken seriously to improve job satisfaction: reasonable and fair income, effective promotion mechanism, fair social old-age security, reasonable workload, and strong psychological coping mechanisms for work stress. The turnover intention of village doctors could be reduced through improving job satisfaction, resilience and work engagement.","Zhang, Xuewen; Bian, Liyan; Bai, Xue; Kong, Dezhong; Liu, Li; Chen, Qing; Li, Ningxiu",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05154-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133112/,PMC,10.1186/s12913-020-05154-0,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

145,The Crisis and Aftermath-II: Society and Economics,"This chapter mentions some other groundbreaking innovations and technological improvements that came along after the crisis. The recent attempts at creating digital currencies, famously known as cryptocurrencies, and their corresponding platform blockchain were some of these. How and why did they emerge? What do their inventions imply for our future? And why are they important? Sharing economy and memberships (as opposed to ownerships) are other examples of profound changes. Increasing use of shared goods, services like Uber and Airbnb, and the unstoppable trend of membership services like e-newspapers, e-libraries, and music streaming points to one conclusion: the end of the idea of ownership. On the governmental side, we have been observing an increasing inclination toward authoritarian states. Liberalism seems to have failed. People have been losing their trust in economic regimes. My argument in this chapter is that without the 2008 crisis, there would have never been these developments and innovations.","Erdem, Orhan",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43343-7_5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134311/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-43343-7_5,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05

148,Anosmia and ageusia are emerging as symptoms in patients with COVID-19: What does the current evidence say?,"There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19. This is of particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects. The purpose of this report was to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians. Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate. Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Hopkins, Claire; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed98,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134577/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed98,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
149,Upheaval in cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak,"On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID-19 outbreak. Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a government-approved isolation centre in Lagos State. This first mortality was that of a 67-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom. The novel COVID-19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer. Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery. This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients’ and oncology professionals’ physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies to ensure that cancer care is not completely disrupted during the outbreak.","Salako, Omolola; Okunade, Kehinde; Allsop, Matthew; Habeebu, Muhammedu; Toye, Mariam; Oluyede, Glory; Fagbenro, Gabriel; Salako, Babatunde",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed97,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134578/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed97,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

154,Rapid detection of African swine fever virus using Cas12a-based portable paper diagnostics,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a dsDNA virus responsible for a severe, highly contagious, and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. ASFV has brought enormous economic loss to a number of countries, and effective vaccine and therapy are still lacking. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticle–antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrument-dependent qPCR method. Taking together, we developed a highly sensitive, instant, and economic Cas12a-mediated paper diagnostics of ASFV, with a great application potential for monitoring ASFV in the field.","Lu, Shuhan; Li, Fang; Chen, Qiubing; Wu, Jing; Duan, Junyi; Lei, Xinlin; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Dongming; Bu, Zhigao; Yin, Hao",https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0151-5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136273/,PMC,10.1038/s41421-020-0151-5,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

Several investigations have been conducted to identify whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through the ocular route, and the conclusion is that it is a potential route but remains uncertain. Due to the face-to-face communication with patients, frequent exposure to tears and ocular discharge, and the unavoidable use of equipment which requires close proximity, ophthalmologists carry a high risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

158,What is global health? Key concepts and clarification of misperceptions: Report of the 2019 GHRP editorial meeting,"The call for “Working Together to Build a Community of Shared Future for Mankind” requires us to improve people’s health across the globe, while global health development entails a satisfactory answer to a fundamental question: “What is global health?” To promote research, teaching, policymaking, and practice in global health, we summarize the main points on the definition of global health from the Editorial Board Meeting of Global Health Research and Policy, convened in July 2019 in Wuhan, China. The meeting functioned as a platform for free brainstorming, in-depth discussion, and post-meeting synthesizing. Through the meeting, we have reached a consensus that global health can be considered as a general guiding principle, an organizing framework for thinking and action, a new branch of sciences and specialized discipline in the large family of public health and medicine. The word “global” in global health can be subjective or objective, depending on the context and setting. In addition to dual-, multi-country and global, a project or a study conducted at a local area can be global if it (1) is framed with a global perspective, (2) intends to address an issue with global impact, and/or (3) seeks global solutions to an issue, such as frameworks, strategies, policies, laws, and regulations. In this regard, global health is eventually an extension of “international health” by borrowing related knowledge, theories, technologies and methodologies from public health and medicine. Although global health is a concept that will continue to evolve, our conceptualization through group effort provides, to date, a comprehensive understanding. This report helps to inform individuals in the global health community to advance global health science and practice, and recommend to take advantage of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China.","Chen, Xinguang; Li, Hao; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo; Abdullah, Abu S.; Huang, Jiayan; Laurence, Charlotte; Liang, Xiaohui; Ma, Zhenyu; Mao, Zongfu; Ren, Ran; Wu, Shaolong; Wang, Nan; Wang, Peigang; Wang, Tingting; Yan, Hong; Zou, Yuliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00142-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136700/,PMC,10.1186/s41256-020-00142-7,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

160,"Epidemiological characteristics and transmissibility of shigellosis in Hubei Province, China, 2005 – 2017","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is one of the main diarrhea diseases in developing countries. However, the transmissibility of shigellosis remains unclear. METHODS: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a “knock-out” simulation in four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS: A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range: 5.99 per 100,000 persons – 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend χ(2) = 25,470.27, P < 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0851–0.0946) and 1.1264 × 10(− 9) (95% CI: 4.1123 × 10(− 10)–1.8416 × 10(− 9)), respectively. The “knock-out” simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13–1.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65–1.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.","Chen, Qi; Rui, Jia; Hu, Qingqing; Peng, Ying; Zhang, Hao; Zhao, Zeyu; Tong, Yeqing; Wu, Yang; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Guan, Xuhua; Chen, Tianmu",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-04976-x,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136996/,PMC,10.1186/s12879-020-04976-x,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
161,Fighting against the common enemy of COVID-19: a practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy — COVID-19.","Qian, Xu; Ren, Ran; Wang, Youfa; Guo, Yan; Fang, Jing; Wu, Zhong-Dao; Liu, Pei-Long; Han, Tie-Ru",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137400/,PMC,10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

168,CIRD-F: Spread and Influence of COVID-19 in China,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in China and the Chinese government took a series of policies to control the epidemic. Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections. At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries.","Zhou, Lingyun; Wu, Kaiwei; Liu, Hanzhi; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2168-1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137851/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2168-1,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
169,Surgery in COVID-19 patients: operational directives,"The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the importance of a mindful utilization of financial and human resources. Preserving resources and manpower is paramount in healthcare. It is important to ensure the ability of surgeons and specialized professionals to function through the pandemic. A conscious effort should be made to minimize infection in this sector. A high mortality rate within this group would be detrimental. This manuscript is the result of a collaboration between the major Italian surgical and anesthesiologic societies: ACOI, SIC, SICUT, SICO, SICG, SIFIPAC, SICE, and SIAARTI. We aim to describe recommended clinical pathways for COVID-19-positive patients requiring acute non-deferrable surgical care. All hospitals should organize dedicated protocols and workforce training as part of the effort to face the current pandemic.","Coccolini, Federico; Perrone, Gennaro; Chiarugi, Massimo; Di Marzo, Francesco; Ansaloni, Luca; Scandroglio, Ildo; Marini, Pierluigi; Zago, Mauro; De Paolis, Paolo; Forfori, Francesco; Agresta, Ferdinando; Puzziello, Alessandro; D’Ugo, Domenico; Bignami, Elena; Bellini, Valentina; Vitali, Pietro; Petrini, Flavia; Pifferi, Barbara; Corradi, Francesco; Tarasconi, Antonio; Pattonieri, Vittoria; Bonati, Elena; Tritapepe, Luigi; Agnoletti, Vanni; Corbella, Davide; Sartelli, Massimo; Catena, Fausto",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13017-020-00307-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137852/,PMC,10.1186/s13017-020-00307-2,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
170,Prediction of COVID-19 Outbreak in China and Optimal Return Date for University Students Based on Propagation Dynamics,"On 12 December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, began to spread around the world from Wuhan, China. It is useful and urgent to consider the future trend of this outbreak. We establish the 4+1 penta-group model to predict the development of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this model, we use the collected data to calibrate the parameters, and let the recovery rate and mortality change according to the actual situation. Furthermore, we propose the BAT model, which is composed of three parts: simulation of the return rush (Back), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, to figure out the best return date for university students. We also discuss the impacts of some factors that may occur in the future, such as secondary infection, emergence of effective drugs, and population flow from Korea to China.","Huang, Ganyu; Pan, Qiaoyi; Zhao, Shuangying; Gao, Yucen; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2167-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137853/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2167-2,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
171,Demand Analysis and Management Suggestion: Sharing Epidemiological Data Among Medical Institutions in Megacities for Epidemic Prevention and Control,"During the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemiological data is essential for controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations. Following Law of the People’s Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier. As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named “one-net management” on dynamic information monitoring. By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.","Cai, Qinyi; Mi, Yiqun; Chu, Zhaowu; Zheng, Yuanyi; Chen, Fang; Liu, Yicheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2166-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137855/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2166-3,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
172,Preliminary Assessment of the COVID-19 Outbreak Using 3-Staged Model e-ISHR,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has aroused widespread concern and attention from all over the world. Many articles have predicted the development of the epidemic. Most of them only use very basic SEIR model without considering the real situation. In this paper, we build a model called e-ISHR model based on SEIR model. Then we add hospital system and time delay system into the original model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 better. Besides, in order to take the government’s control and people’s awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease. By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei. We also change some of parameters in our model. The results indicate the importance of isolation and increasing the number of beds in hospital.","Li, Sijia; Song, Kun; Yang, Boran; Gao, Yucen; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2169-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137856/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2169-0,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

174,Re-engineering the Cypriot healthcare service system,"BACKGROUND: The Cypriot healthcare system has undergone a number of major transformations since the induction of the Republic of Cyprus in the European Union over 10 years ago. Currently Cyprus is undergoing a major reform, namely the introduction of a primary care driven national healthcare system. The aim of the study was to assess the existing state of training, support, quality, guidelines and infrastructure towards a better healthcare system in Cyprus. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study combining statistical data until October 2016 and workshop discussions delivered in Cyprus in November 2015. We used anonymised data provided: (1a) by the Cyprus Medical Association of all registered medical doctors up to October 2016; (1b); by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Health Monitoring Unit up to October 2016; (2) during a workshop organised with representatives from the Royal College of Physicians, the European Commission and the Health Insurance Organization. RESULTS: The gender ratio of men over women is disproportionate, with over 85% of the medical doctors undertaking their training in Greece, Eastern Europe and neighbouring countries, while the current record does not hold a relevant specialty information for 4 out of 10 doctors. The results show lack of statutory inspection systems, application of revalidation principles or implementation of peer-review clinical services on the island. There are eight proposed recommendations made by the workshop participants towards the transformation of the Cypriot healthcare system and the development of the Cyprus Quality Improvement Institute. These are aimed at addressing gaps in quality of care, adherence to clinical guidelines and implementation of audits, development of doctors’ revalidation and peer-review of clinical services, accreditation of service implementation, establishment of a statutory inspection system as well as the set-up of an incentives program as part of the general healthcare system (GHS) of Cyprus. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts for the implementation of the new GHS in Cyprus call for adequate training and support of the medical workforce, transparent and safer quality of care provision through the implementation of clinical guidelines and capacity-building infrastructure.","Pallari, Elena; Samoutis, George; Rudd, Anthony",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-5048-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137859/,PMC,10.1186/s12913-020-5048-3,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
175,D(2)EA: Depict the Epidemic Picture of COVID-19,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused a global alert. To release social panic and guide future schedules, this article proposes a novel mathematical model, the Delay Differential Epidemic Analyzer (D(2)EA), to analyze the dynamics of epidemic and forecast its future trends. Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D(2)EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D(2)EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D(2)EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the quarantine measures and schedule the date to reopen Hubei Province.","Liu, Chenzhengyi; Zhao, Jingwei; Liu, Guohang; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2170-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137902/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2170-7,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

181,"A Comprehensive Literature Review on the Clinical Presentation, and Management of the Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic. There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization. A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media. This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed. The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented. Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed.

182,A tripartite ssDNA mycovirus from a plant pathogenic fungus is infectious as cloned DNA and purified virions,"Here, we describe a tripartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA mycovirus, named Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1). The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus.","Li, Pengfei; Wang, Shuangchao; Zhang, Lihang; Qiu, Dewen; Zhou, Xueping; Guo, Lihua",https://www.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay9634,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138691/,PMC,10.1126/sciadv.aay9634,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

187,Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: A new type of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is causing an increasing number of cases of pneumonia and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and traditional Chinese herbal medicine is being used for its treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess studies of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19 and traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ). Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P < 0.10. Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger’s test and Begg’s test, and Trim and Fill analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.

191,Maintaining Places of Social Inclusion: Ebola and the Emergency Department,"We introduce the concept of places of social inclusion—institutions endowed by a society or a community with material resources, meaning, and values at geographic sites where citizens can access services for specific needs—as taken-for-granted, essential, and inherently precarious. Based on our study of an emergency department that was disrupted by the threat of the Ebola virus in 2014, we develop a process model to explain how a place of social inclusion can be maintained by custodians. We show how these custodians—in our fieldsite, doctors and nurses—experience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety. We also demonstrate how the interplay of custodians’ emotions is integral to maintaining the place of social inclusion. The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society. We also reveal the theoretical and practical importance of places as institutions, deepen understanding of custodians and custodianship as a form of institutional work, and offer new insight into the dynamic processes that connect emotions and institutional work.","Wright, April L.; Meyer, Alan D.; Reay, Trish; Staggs, Jonathan",https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0001839220916401,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141156/,PMC,10.1177/0001839220916401,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

193,Recent advances in understanding inherited deficiencies in immunity to infections,"The immune system is central to our interactions with the world in which we live and importantly dictates our response to potential allergens, toxins, and pathogens to which we are constantly exposed. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie protective host immune responses against microbial pathogens is vital for the development of improved treatment and vaccination strategies against infections. To that end, inherited immunodeficiencies that manifest with susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and/or fungal infections have provided fundamental insights into the indispensable contribution of key immune pathways in host defense against various pathogens.

194,Influence of Community and Culture in the Ethical Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources in a Pandemic Situation: Deliberative Democracy Study,"BACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others’ views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L",https://www.doi.org/10.2196/18272,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141421/,PMC,10.2196/18272,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
195,Covid-19 in Critically Ill Patients in the Seattle Region — Case Series,"BACKGROUND: Community transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020. METHODS: We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both. Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.

196,"Divided Tokyo: Housing Policy, the Ideology of Homeownership, and the Growing Contrast Between the City Center and the Suburbs","This chapter examines the generation of Tokyo’s division over time by focusing on the changes in national and municipal policies on urban planning, land use, and housing, as well as the outcomes of these long-term trajectories since the 1950s onward. By comparing with the Western urban discourse, we clarify the process of how Tokyo became divided in terms of residential conditions. The national government focused on the growth of major metropolitan areas, stimulating suburban development and homeownership in the suburbs from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, after the late 1990s, the target shifted from the suburbs to the city centers. Alongside global competition among cities, the long-term recession of the Japanese economy, and social changes, continuous investment to grow central Tokyo has increased in importance. In contrast, suburban neighborhoods are facing challenges related to an aging population and an increase in housing vacancies. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs to revitalize and re-grow. The sharp contrast between the growth in city centers and the shrinking suburbs, and specifically the divided Tokyo, will become more obvious in the next decade.","Kubo, Tomoko",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7143446/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_2,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09

212,Geriatric infections: Decreased immunity or evolved opportunists?,"In host–parasite co-evolution, parasites are assumed to have an advantage owing to their shorter generation time. Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However, this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued long-term existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28- to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2, 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with age. In both groups, there was greater mortality or morbidity among the infected in the old-age classes. These patterns are better explained by pathogen evolution than by age-related decline in immunity.

Due to the rapidly escalating numbers of new infections outside China, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, in a message delivered by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General [1]. As of March 21, about 166 countries globally had recoded cases of the COVID-19 in only 4 months since its outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [2, 3]. With the Antarctic continent unaffected, Africa, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has recorded the least number of cases, despite the cited moderate-to-high risk of infection [4].

214,"Coronavirus infections: Epidemiological, clinical and immunological features and hypotheses","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","Raoult, Didier; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Kroemer, Guido",https://www.doi.org/10.15698/cst2020.04.216,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146059/,PMC,10.15698/cst2020.04.216,02/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-02
215,TRIM62 From Chicken as a Negative Regulator of Reticuloendotheliosis Virus Replication,"Emerging evidence suggests that the tripartite motif containing 62 (TRIM62), a member of the TRIM family, plays an important role in antiviral processes. The objective of the study was to explore the role of TRIM62 in reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection and its potential molecular mechanism. We first demonstrated that the REV infection affected the TRIM62 expression first upregulated and then downregulated in CEF cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of TRIM62 on viral replication. Overexpression of TRIM62 decreased REV replication. On the contrary, silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM62 increased viral replication. Then, to explore the necessity of domains in TRIM62's negative regulation on viral replication, we transfected CEF cells with TRIM62 domain deletion mutants. Deletion domain partially abolished TRIM62's antiviral activity. The effect of SPRY domain deletion was the highest and that of coiled-coil was the lowest. Further, we identified 18 proteins that coimmunoprecipitated and interacted with TRIM62 by immunocoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Strikingly, among which, both Ras-related protein Rab-5b (RAB5B) and Arp2/3 complex 34-kDa subunit (ARPC2) were involved in actin cytoskeletal pathway. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that chicken TRIM62 provides host defense against viral infection, and all domains are required for its action. RAB5B and ARPC2 may play important roles in its negative regulation processes.","Li, Ling; Niu, Dongyan; Yang, Jie; Bi, Jianmin; Zhang, Lingjuan; Cheng, Ziqiang; Wang, Guihua",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00152,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146716/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00152,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

227,CoViD-19 Immunopathology and Immunotherapy,"New evidence on the T-cell immuno-pathology in patient’s with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) was reported by Diao et al. in MedRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364) [1]. It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed. Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19.","Chiappelli, Francesco; Khakshooy, Allen; Greenberg, Gillian",https://www.doi.org/10.6026/97320630016219,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147500/,PMC,10.6026/97320630016219,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

229,"Protective Microglial Subset in Development, Aging, and Disease: Lessons From Transcriptomic Studies","Microglial heterogeneity has been the topic of much discussion in the scientific community. Elucidation of their plasticity and adaptability to disease states triggered early efforts to characterize microglial subsets. Over time, their phenotypes, and later on their homeostatic signature, were revealed, through the use of increasingly advanced transcriptomic techniques. Recently, an increasing number of these “microglial signatures” have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature. We describe that this subset is found in development and in normal aging as well as in diverse diseases. We discuss the functions of this subset as well as how it is induced.","Benmamar-Badel, Anouk; Owens, Trevor; Wlodarczyk, Agnieszka",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00430,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147523/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00430,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
230,"Epidemiology of Human Adenoviruses: A 20-Year Retrospective Observational Study in Hospitalized Patients in Bern, Switzerland","BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) is an important pathogen seen in clinical practice. Long-term studies may help better understand epidemiological trends and changes in circulating genotypes over time. PURPOSE: Using a large biobank of samples from hospitalized, adenovirus-positive patients over a 20-year period, we aimed to analyze long-term epidemiological trends and genotypic relatedness among circulating HAdV strains. METHODS: Based on samples from hospitalized patients confirmed to be HAdV positive in Bern, Switzerland, from 1998 to 2017, and on their associated demographic and clinical data, we identified epidemiological trends and risk factors associated with HAdV infection. HAdV genotyping was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the hypervariable hexon gene. The obtained sequences were phylogenetically compared with sequences from international HAdV strains. RESULTS: HAdV was identified in 1302 samples tested. Cases of HAdV infection were reported throughout the years with no clear seasonality. Upper respiratory tract samples, conjunctivitis swabs, and stool had the highest positivity rate (56.2%, 18.7%, and 14.2% of the cases, respectively). HAdV infection was highest among children ≤4 years old. Increased number of HAdV cases were observed in years 2009 (n = 110) and 2010 (n =112). HAdV8 was the predominant genotype among patients older than 20 years, and was mostly associated with ophthalmic infection. Predominant genotypes among children ≤4 years old were HAdV1, HAdV2, and HAdV3, which were mostly associated with respiratory tract infections. Recurring peaks of increased HAdV cases were evidenced every 4 years among children ≤4 years old. CONCLUSION: Our study gives novel insights on long-term epidemiological trends and phylogenetic relatedness among circulating HAdV strains in Switzerland, country in which little data on HAdV prevalence and diversity was so far available.","Akello, Joyce Odeke; Kamgang, Richard; Barbani, Maria Teresa; Suter-Riniker, Franziska; Leib, Stephen L; Ramette, Alban",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/clep.s246352,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147615/,PMC,10.2147/clep.s246352,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05
231,Can an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be developed for the older population?,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its inordinately rapid spread is posing severe challenges to the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide, health care systems and the global economy. While many younger people experience no or mild symptoms on infection, older adults are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and systemic conditions which demand a full understanding and leveraging of knowledge of the differences between immunity in young and old people. Consequently, we welcome papers addressing any issues relevant to immunity and ageing in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and will endeavour to fast-track peer-review. We aim to provide a platform exclusively for discussions of individual and age differences in susceptibility and immune responses to COVID caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and how to prevent or reduce severity of disease in older adults.","Pawelec, Graham; Weng, Nan-ping",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00180-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148425/,PMC,10.1186/s12979-020-00180-2,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

236,Implementing One Health approaches to confront emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease threats: lessons from PREDICT,"Recurring outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses, such as Ebola virus disease, avian influenza, and Nipah virus, serve as a reminder that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are interconnected and that early response to emerging zoonotic pathogens requires a coordinated, interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach. As our world becomes increasingly connected, emerging diseases pose a greater threat, requiring coordination at local, regional, and global levels. One Health is a multisectoral, transdisciplinary, and collaborative approach promoted to more effectively address these complex health threats. Despite strong advocacy for One Health, challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges. We also share strategies applied to achieve successful outcomes through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program PREDICT project, which serve as useful case studies for implementing One Health approaches. Lastly, we explore methods for promoting more formal One Health implementation to capitalize on the added value of shared knowledge and leveraged resources.","Kelly, Terra R.; Machalaba, Catherine; Karesh, William B.; Crook, Paulina Zielinska; Gilardi, Kirsten; Nziza, Julius; Uhart, Marcela M.; Robles, Erika Alandia; Saylors, Karen; Joly, Damien O.; Monagin, Corina; Mangombo, Prime Mulembakani; Kingebeni, Placide Mbala; Kazwala, Rudovick; Wolking, David; Smith, Woutrina; Mazet, Jonna A.

237,Reproduction of East-African bats may guide risk mitigation for coronavirus spillover,"BACKGROUND: Bats provide important ecosystem services; however, current evidence supports that they host several zoonotic viruses, including species of the Coronaviridae family. If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions. METHODS: To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle. RESULTS: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling – an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels – and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.","Montecino-Latorre, Diego; Goldstein, Tracey; Gilardi, Kirsten; Wolking, David; Van Wormer, Elizabeth; Kazwala, Rudovick; Ssebide, Benard; Nziza, Julius; Sijali, Zikankuba; Cranfield, Michael; Mazet, Jonna A.

289,Molecular Mechanism of Functional Ingredients in Barley to Combat Human Chronic Diseases,"Barley plays an important role in health and civilization of human migration from Africa to Asia, later to Eurasia. We demonstrated the systematic mechanism of functional ingredients in barley to combat chronic diseases, based on PubMed, CNKI, and ISI Web of Science databases from 2004 to 2020. Barley and its extracts are rich in 30 ingredients to combat more than 20 chronic diseases, which include the 14 similar and 9 different chronic diseases between grains and grass, due to the major molecular mechanism of six functional ingredients of barley grass (GABA, flavonoids, SOD, K-Ca, vitamins, and tryptophan) and grains (β-glucans, polyphenols, arabinoxylan, phytosterols, tocols, and resistant starch). The antioxidant activity of barley grass and grain has the same and different functional components. These results support findings that barley grain and its grass are the best functional food, promoting ancient Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations, and further show the depending functional ingredients for diet from Pliocene hominids in Africa and Neanderthals in Europe to modern humans in the world. This review paper not only reveals the formation and action mechanism of barley diet overcoming human chronic diseases, but also provides scientific basis for the development of health products and drugs for the prevention and treatment of human chronic diseases.","Zeng, Yawen; Pu, Xiaoying; Du, Juan; Yang, Xiaomeng; Li, Xia; Mandal, Md.

290,Main trends in the design of semi-synthetic antibiotics of a new generation,"This review summarizes main advances achieved by Russian researchers in the synthesis and characterization of semi-synthetic antibiotics of a new generation in the period from 2004 to 2019. The following classes of compounds are considered as the basis for modification: polycyclic antibacterial glycopeptides of the vancomycin group, classical macrolides, antifungal polyene macrolides, the antitumour antibiotic olivomycin A, antitumour anthracyclines and broad-spectrum antibiotics, in particular, oligomycin A, heliomycin and some other. Main trends in the design of modern anti-infective and antitumour agents over this period are considered in relation to original natural antibiotics, which have been independently discovered by Russian researchers. It is shown that a new type of hybrid structures can, in principle, be synthesized based on glycopeptides, macrolides and other antibiotics, including heterodimers containing a new benzoxaborole pharmacophore. The review addresses the influence of the length of the spacer between two antibiotic molecules on the biological activity of hybrid structures. A combination of genetic engineering techniques and methods of organic synthesis is shown to be useful for the design of new potent antifungal antibiotics based on polyenes of the amphotericin B group. Many new semi-synthetic analogues exhibit important biological properties, such as a broad spectrum of activity and low toxicity. Emphasis is given to certain aspects related to investigation of a broad range of biological activity and mechanisms of action of new derivatives.

291,Signal amplification and quantification on lateral flow assays by laser excitation of plasmonic nanomaterials,"Lateral flow assay (LFA) has become one of the most widely used point-of-care diagnostic methods due to its simplicity and low cost. While easy to use, LFA suffers from its low sensitivity and poor quantification, which largely limits its applications for early disease diagnosis and requires further testing to eliminate false-negative results. Over the past decade, signal enhancement strategies that took advantage of the laser excitation of plasmonic nanomaterials have pushed down the detection limit and enabled quantification of analytes. Significantly, these methods amplify the signal based on the current LFA design without modification. This review highlights these strategies of signal enhancement for LFA including surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photothermal and photoacoustic methods. Perspectives on the rational design of the reader systems are provided. Future translation of the research toward clinical applications is also discussed.","Ye, Haihang; Liu, Yaning; Zhan, Li; Liu, Yilin; Qin, Zhenpeng",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/thno.44298,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150487/,PMC,10.7150/thno.44298,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
292,CT Scans of Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia,"Rationale: The increasing speed of confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is striking in China. The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. Methods: In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020. The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution. Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated. The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. Results: Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type. Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type). Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days). Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases). No patient has died in our hospital to date. The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days). The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. Conclusion: Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment. Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.","Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xingzhi; Yu, Qizhi; Liu, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/thno.45016,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150491/,PMC,10.7150/thno.45016,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
293,Cocirculation of Four Infectious Bronchitis Virus Lineages in Broiler Chickens in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia from 2012 to 2014,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an evolving and dynamic virus that causes major economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide. Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination. Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains. Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction- (RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. IBV was detected in 36.5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014. Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes. Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28.6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21.4%). The latter lineage include two subgroups: IS/720/99 IBV (16.7%) and IS/Variant2/98 IBV (4.7%). Some of the detections made in the 4/91 and Mass lineages are expected to belong to the vaccine strains. Lineages without a homologous vaccine in use (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) represent 50% of the isolates recovered in this study. Based on identity with the vaccine sequences, field observations, and frequent detection, these two lineages appear to be out of coverage of the IBV vaccines used in Saudi Arabia. This is the first time to identify Middle East lineage (IS/720/99 IBV and IS/Variant2/98 IBV) in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia.","Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I. A.; Al-Kubati, Anwar A.

294,Coronavirus Goes Viral: Quantifying the COVID-19 Misinformation Epidemic on Twitter,"Background Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, misinformation has been spreading uninhibited over traditional and social media at a rapid pace. We sought to analyze the magnitude of misinformation that is being spread on Twitter (Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, CA) regarding the coronavirus epidemic. Materials and methods We conducted a search on Twitter using 14 different trending hashtags and keywords related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We then summarized and assessed individual tweets for misinformation in comparison to verified and peer-reviewed resources. Descriptive statistics were used to compare terms and hashtags, and to identify individual tweets and account characteristics. Results The study included 673 tweets. Most tweets were posted by informal individuals/groups (66%), and 129 (19.2%) belonged to verified Twitter accounts. The majority of included tweets contained serious content (91.2%); 548 tweets (81.4%) included genuine information pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic. Around 70% of the tweets tackled medical/public health information, while the others were pertaining to sociopolitical and financial factors. In total, 153 tweets (24.8%) included misinformation, and 107 (17.4%) included unverifiable information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. The rate of misinformation was higher among informal individual/group accounts (33.8%, p: <0.001). Tweets from unverified Twitter accounts contained more misinformation (31.0% vs 12.6% for verified accounts, p: <0.001). Tweets from healthcare/public health accounts had the lowest rate of unverifiable information (12.3%, p: 0.04). The number of likes and retweets per tweet was not associated with a difference in either false or unverifiable content. The keyword “COVID-19” had the lowest rate of misinformation and unverifiable information, while the keywords “#2019_ncov” and “Corona” were associated with the highest amount of misinformation and unverifiable content respectively. Conclusions Medical misinformation and unverifiable content pertaining to the global COVID-19 epidemic are being propagated at an alarming rate on social media. We provide an early quantification of the magnitude of misinformation spread and highlight the importance of early interventions in order to curb this phenomenon that endangers public safety at a time when awareness and appropriate preventive actions are paramount.","Kouzy, Ramez; Abi Jaoude, Joseph; Kraitem, Afif; El Alam, Molly B; Karam, Basil; Adib, Elio; Zarka, Jabra; Traboulsi, Cindy; Akl, Elie W; Baddour, Khalil",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7255,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152572/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7255,13/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-13

303,"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 26 Cases of COVID-19 Arising from Patient-to-Patient Transmission in Liaocheng, China","INTRODUCTION: Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. METHODS: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. RESULTS: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment. DISCUSSION: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.","Wang, Lizhen; Duan, Yueting; Zhang, Wenming; Liang, Juan; Xu, Jianxiang; Zhang, Yongqing; Wu, Changgang; Xu, Yangling; Li, Hua",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/clep.s249903,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154005/,PMC,10.2147/clep.s249903,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09
304,First COVID-19 infections in the Philippines: a case report,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for more fatalities than the SARS coronavirus, despite being in the initial stage of a global pandemic. The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient’s condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.","Edrada, Edna M.; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Salva Villarama, Eumelia P.; Dagoc, Bren F.; Smith, Chris; Sayo, Ana Ria; Verona, Jeffrey A.; Trifalgar-Arches, Jamie; Lazaro, Jezreel; Balinas, Ellen Grace M.; Telan, Elizabeth Freda O.; Roy, Lynsil; Galon, Myvie; Florida, Carl Hill N.; Ukawa, Tatsuya; Villaneuva, Annavi Marie G.; Saito, Nobuo; Nepomuceno, Jean Raphael; Ariyoshi, Koya; Carlos, Celia; Nicolasora, Amalea Dulcene; Solante, Rontgene M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00203-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154063/,PMC,10.1186/s41182-020-00203-0,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

306,Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Infection Taking ACEI/ARB,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. SUMMARY: Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.","Rico-Mesa, Juan Simon; White, Averi; Anderson, Allen S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01291-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154066/,PMC,10.1007/s11886-020-01291-4,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14
307,"Better Epitope Discovery, Precision Immune Engineering, and Accelerated Vaccine Design Using Immunoinformatics Tools","Computational vaccinology includes epitope mapping, antigen selection, and immunogen design using computational tools. Tools that facilitate the in silico prediction of immune response to biothreats, emerging infectious diseases, and cancers can accelerate the design of novel and next generation vaccines and their delivery to the clinic. Over the past 20 years, vaccinologists, bioinformatics experts, and advanced programmers based in Providence, Rhode Island, USA have advanced the development of an integrated toolkit for vaccine design called iVAX, that is secure and user-accessible by internet. This integrated set of immunoinformatic tools comprises algorithms for scoring and triaging candidate antigens, selecting immunogenic and conserved T cell epitopes, re-engineering or eliminating regulatory T cell epitopes, and re-designing antigens to induce immunogenicity and protection against disease for humans and livestock. Commercial and academic applications of iVAX have included identifying immunogenic T cell epitopes in the development of a T-cell based human multi-epitope Q fever vaccine, designing novel influenza vaccines, identifying cross-conserved T cell epitopes for a malaria vaccine, and analyzing immune responses in clinical vaccine studies. Animal vaccine applications to date have included viral infections of pigs such as swine influenza A, PCV2, and African Swine Fever. “Rapid-Fire” applications for biodefense have included a demonstration project for Lassa Fever and Q fever. As recent infectious disease outbreaks underscore the significance of vaccine-driven preparedness, the integrated set of tools available on the iVAX toolkit stand ready to help vaccine developers deliver genome-derived, epitope-driven vaccines.","De Groot, Anne S.; Moise, Leonard; Terry, Frances; Gutierrez, Andres H.; Hindocha, Pooja; Richard, Guilhem; Hoft, Daniel Fredric; Ross, Ted M.; Noe, Amy R.; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Kotraiah, Vinayaka; Silk, Sarah E.; Nielsen, Carolyn M.; Minassian, Angela M.; Ashfield, Rebecca; Ardito, Matt; Draper, Simon J.; Martin, William D.",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00442,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154102/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00442,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
308,Unraveling Plant Natural Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery Purposes,"The screening and testing of extracts against a variety of pharmacological targets in order to benefit from the immense natural chemical diversity is a concern in many laboratories worldwide. And several successes have been recorded in finding new actives in natural products, some of which have become new drugs or new sources of inspiration for drugs. But in view of the vast amount of research on the subject, it is surprising that not more drug candidates were found. In our view, it is fundamental to reflect upon the approaches of such drug discovery programs and the technical processes that are used, along with their inherent difficulties and biases. Based on an extensive survey of recent publications, we discuss the origin and the variety of natural chemical diversity as well as the strategies to having the potential to embrace this diversity. It seemed to us that some of the difficulties of the area could be related with the technical approaches that are used, so the present review begins with synthetizing some of the more used discovery strategies, exemplifying some key points, in order to address some of their limitations. It appears that one of the challenges of natural product-based drug discovery programs should be an easier access to renewable sources of plant-derived products. Maximizing the use of the data together with the exploration of chemical diversity while working on reasonable supply of natural product-based entities could be a way to answer this challenge. We suggested alternative ways to access and explore part of this chemical diversity with in vitro cultures. We also reinforced how important it was organizing and making available this worldwide knowledge in an “inventory” of natural products and their sources. And finally, we focused on strategies based on synthetic biology and syntheses that allow reaching industrial scale supply. Approaches based on the opportunities lying in untapped natural plant chemical diversity are also considered.","Lautié, Emmanuelle; Russo, Olivier; Ducrot, Pierre; Boutin, Jean A.",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00397,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154113/,PMC,10.3389/fphar.2020.00397,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
309,Using Biosecurity Measures to Combat Respiratory Disease in Cattle: The Norwegian Control Program for Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Bovine Coronavirus,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cause important health problems in all cattle husbandry systems. It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination, mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal's environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development, the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD, the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health, welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.","Stokstad, Maria; Klem, Thea Blystad; Myrmel, Mette; Oma, Veslemøy Sunniva; Toftaker, Ingrid; Østerås, Olav; Nødtvedt, Ane",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00167,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154156/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00167,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
310,Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?,"A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and has become a world-wide public health challenge. About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.","Fu, Binqing; Xu, Xiaoling; Wei, Haiming",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154566/,PMC,10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

320,First Identification of Human Adenovirus Subtype 21a in China With MinION and Illumina Sequencers,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been demonstrated to cause a diversity of diseases among children and adults. The circulation of human adenovirus type 21 (HAdV21) has been mainly documented within closed environments in several countries. Nonetheless, respiratory infections or outbreaks due to HAdV21 have never been reported in China. MinION and Illumina platforms were employed to identify the potential pathogen from a throat swab. Discrepancies between MinION and Illumina sequencing were validated and corrected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic characterization and recombinant event detection were then performed. Among the 35,466 high-quality MinION reads, a total of 5,999 reads (16.91%) could be aligned to HAdV21 reference genomes (genome sizes ≈35.3 kb), among which 20 had a length of >30 kb. A genome sequence assembled from MinION reads was further classified as HAdV subtype 21a. Random downsampling revealed as few as 500 nanopore reads could cover ≥96.49% of current genome. Illumina sequencing displayed good consistency (pairwise nucleotide identity = 99.91%) with MinION sequencing but with 31 discrepancies that were further validated and confirmed by PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing. Restriction enzymes such as BamHI and KpnI were able to distinguish the present genome from HAdV21 prototype and HAdV21b. Phylogenetic analysis employing whole-genome sequences placed our genome with members only from subtype 21a. Common features among HAdV21a strains were identified, including polymorphisms discovered in penton and 100 kDa hexon assembly–associated proteins and a recombinant event in the E4 gene. Using MinION and Illumina sequencers, we identified the first HAdV21a strain from China, which could provide key genomic data for disease control and epidemiological investigations.","Ye, Fuqiang; Han, Yifang; Zhu, Juanjuan; Li, Peng; Zhang, Qi; Lin, Yanfeng; Wang, Taiwu; Lv, Heng; Wang, Changjun; Wang, Chunhui; Zhang, Jinhai",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.00285,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155751/,PMC,10.3389/fgene.2020.00285,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

326,Mathematical prediction of the time evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy by a Gauss error function and Monte Carlo simulations,"In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID-19 pandemic based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function, with four parameters, as a cumulative distribution function. We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, that is, to the change in sign of its second derivative (i.e., the change from acceleration to deceleration), as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy, obtaining consistent results. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities. Although official data have been used, those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach since they are based on a statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs, medical, social distancing, virological and epidemiological) or models of contamination diffusion.","Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio",https://www.doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00383-y,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156796/,PMC,10.1140/epjp/s13360-020-00383-y,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
327,Post-traumatic stress symptoms in hemodialysis patients with MERS-CoV exposure,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress symptoms can occur in patients with medical illness. During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, some dialysis patients in three centers who were incidentally exposed to patients or medical staff with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated to interrupt the spread of the infection. We aimed to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk factors among these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. RESULTS: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K’s cutoff point (≧18). Prevalence rates of IES-R-K ≧18 did not differ significantly according to isolation method. However, isolation duration was linearly associated with the IES-R-K score (standardized β coefficient − 0.272, P = 0.026). Scores in Avoidance, Emotional numbing and Dissociation subscale were higher in patients with longer isolation period. CONCLUSION: MERS was a traumatic experience for quarantined HD patients. IES-R-K scores were not significantly different by isolation methods. However, short isolation was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms.","Cho, A Jin; Lee, Hong-Seock; Lee, Young-Ki; Jeon, Hee Jung; Park, Hayne Cho; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Sang-Ho; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Wong, Ae Kyeong",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13030-020-00181-z,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156895/,PMC,10.1186/s13030-020-00181-z,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
328,"Treatment efficacy analysis of traditional Chinese medicine for novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): an empirical study from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China","BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus was identified in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played an active role in combating the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by this fast-spreading virus COVID-19. Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC). METHODS: Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients’ hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways. RESULT: The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality. CONCLUSION: TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients’ recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.","Luo, Erdan; Zhang, Daiyan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Bowen; Zhao, Keming; Zhao, Yonghua; Bian, Ying; Wang, Yitao",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-00317-x,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156896/,PMC,10.1186/s13020-020-00317-x,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
329,The transmissibility of novel Coronavirus in the early stages of the 2019-20 outbreak in Wuhan: Exploring initial point-source exposure sizes and durations using scenario analysis,"Background: The current novel coronavirus outbreak appears to have originated from a point-source exposure event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","Abbott, Sam; Hellewell, Joel; Munday, James; Funk, Sebastian",https://www.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15718.1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156988/,PMC,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15718.1,03/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-03

332,"Coronavirus Infections in Children Including COVID-19: An Overview of the Epidemiology, Clinical Features, Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention Options in Children","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",https://www.doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002660,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158880/,PMC,10.1097/inf.0000000000002660,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12

345,The Applicability of the Law of the WTO to Green Energy Security,"This chapter explores a new perspective for the debate surrounding green energy disputes within the current WTO rules. Studies of green energy trade under the WTO have predominantly focused on the balance between WTO obligations and domestic public policy space for green energy initiatives as a way to address environmental and climate change objectives. This chapter, however, analyses whether there is any flexibility within the current WTO rules, specifically the GATT exceptions, and the interpretations given to them, that permit trade restrictive measures that support national green energy policies with a view of ensuring energy security. Overall, this chapter demonstrates that (i) green energy development has increasingly come to be associated with energy security in the WTO jurisprudence, and (ii) there might be some room for green energy security within the defences under GATT Articles III:8(a), Article XX(a) and (j) and Article XXI. However, these defences have limited applicability and may also have undesirable outcomes.","Rutherford, Angelica",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45555-2_4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7160463/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-45555-2_4,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

360,Veno‐venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe pneumonia: COVID‐19 case in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Veno‐venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV‐ECMO) is one of the ultimate treatments for acute respiratory failure. However, the effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72‐year‐old woman who was a passenger of a cruise ship tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) while in quarantine on board using throat swab. Three days after admission, her condition deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated. On day 6, VV‐ECMO was introduced. Lopinavir/ritonavir was given; continuous renal replacement therapy was also introduced. On day 10, her chest radiography and lung compliance improved. She was weaned off ECMO on day 12. CONCLUSION: Treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID‐19 by ECMO should recognize lung plasticity considering time to ECMO introduction and interstitial biomarkers. In Japan, centralization of ECMO patients has not been sufficient. Thus, we suggest nationwide centralization and further research to respond to the crisis caused by COVID‐19.","Taniguchi, Hayato; Ogawa, Fumihiro; Honzawa, Hiroshi; Yamaguchi, Keishi; Niida, Shoko; Shinohara, Mafumi; Takahashi, Kohei; Iwashita, Masayuki; Abe, Takeru; Kubo, Sousuke; Kudo, Makoto; Takeuchi, Ichiro",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/ams2.509,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161844/,PMC,10.1002/ams2.509,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

384,"Changes in Subway Ridership in Response to COVID-19 in Seoul, South Korea: Implications for Social Distancing","Introduction While numerous episodes of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and subsequent government announcements in South Korea were accompanied by widespread social distancing efforts by the people, it is unclear whether these episodes and government announcements were actually influential in improving social distancing, or whether the level of response among different demographic groups varied. Methods Data were downloaded from Seoul Data Open Plaza, and changes in the number of passengers on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway network between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, were used to assess the extent to which people in Seoul practiced social distancing. Five events regarding COVID-19 that received wide public attention between January and March 2020 were identified and the changes in the number of passengers before and after each event were analyzed. Also, similar analyses were performed for 16 stations that were specific in either the age or purpose of the visit of the passengers. Results Compared to the third week of January 2020 (January 13-19), the mean daily number of passengers in all stations decreased by 2,984,857.4 or 40.6% by the first week of March (March 2-8). The percentage decrease in individual stations between this period was not significantly different between “young” and “old” stations (46.3% vs. 49.2%; p = 0.551) but was significantly smaller in “work” stations than in “leisure” stations (36.2% vs. 51.6%; p = 0.021). Of the five events, the first reported death due to COVID-19 in South Korea and the identification of a mass infection cluster in Daegu on February 20 were accompanied by the greatest decrease of the mean daily number of passengers (1,352,153.3 or 20.8%), while the first mass infection in Seoul on March 10 and the announcement of aggressive social distancing campaign on March 22 were accompanied by an increase in the number of passengers. Conclusions The number of subway passengers in Seoul decreased markedly during late February but slowly increased afterward, suggesting decreasing levels of risk perception and adherence to social distancing. Understanding the differing patterns of subway use by age or purpose of the visit may guide policymakers and the general public in shaping their future response to the current pandemic.","Park, Jewel",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7668,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163336/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7668,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14
385,World Economic Prospects Monthly,"Overview: Outlook darkens as coronavirus spreads ▀ What began as a supply shock in China has morphed into something much more serious. The effects of financial market weakness and the disruption to daily life around the world will trigger lower consumer spending and investment on top of the disruptions to the global supply chain. We now expect global GDP growth to slow to 2.0% this year from 2.6% in 2019, before picking up to 3.0% in 2021. But a global pandemic would lead to a far bigger slowdown this year. ▀ China seems to have made progress in containing the spread of the coronavirus, but the slow return to business as normal has prompted us to cut year‐on‐year GDP growth in Q1 from 3.8% to 2.3%, the weakest in decades. But we expect a healthy growth rebound in Q2 which will also provide Asian economies with a lift. ▀ It is isolation policies not infection rates that determine the economic impact. Outbreaks around the world are leading authorities to announce a growing list of measures to curb the virus spread. At a global level any Q2 rebound will thus be small at best. We expect investment in the advanced economies as a whole to contract on a year‐on‐year basis in Q2 for the first time since the global financial crisis, while annual household spending growth may slow to its lowest since the eurozone crisis. ▀ Our baseline assumes that the global economy will return to business as usual in Q3 and that some catch‐up will result in robust H2 GDP growth. Combined with favourable base effects in early‐2021, this is expected to result in world GDP growth averaging about 3% in 2021. ▀ Since January, we have cut our 2020 global GDP growth forecast by a hefty 0.5pp. But larger revisions may be required if the disruption triggered by shutdowns and other responses to coronavirus proves longer than we assume currently or if more draconian actions are needed in the event of a global pandemic.

388,A Review of Salivary Diagnostics and Its Potential Implication in Detection of Covid-19,"Saliva is an exocrine secretion produced from the salivary glands and has numerous functions, such as cleansing and protection of the oral cavity, antimicrobial effects and aids in digestion. Due to the speedy development in the field of salivaomics, saliva is now well accepted as a pool of biological markers that vary from changes in biochemicals, nucleic acids and proteins to the microflora. Saliva has an immense potential as a diagnostic fluid and offers an edge over other biological fluids as its collection method does not require invasive procedure, economical and is useful for monitoring systemic health. Development of sensitive and precise salivary diagnostic tools and the formulation of defined guidelines following meticulous testing will allow salivary diagnostics to be utilised as chair side tests for various oral and systemic diseases in the near future. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is the biggest challenge and global health crisis for the world since World War Two. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in controlling the outbreak in the community and in hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen types for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. The collection of these specimen types requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients and poses a risk of transmission of the virus, causes discomfort and may cause bleeding, especially in patients with condition such as thrombocytopenia. Hence, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs are not desirable for sequential monitoring of viral load. Saliva specimens can be obtained easily as the patient is asked to spit into a sterile bottle. The collection of saliva is non-invasive and greatly minimizes the exposure of healthcare workers to Covid-19. Saliva has a high consistency rate of greater than 90% with nasopharyngeal specimens in the detection of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses. Saliva has also been used in screening respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without pyrexia or respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV can be detected in saliva at high titers. Salivary diagnostics is a dynamic field that is being incorporated as part of disease diagnosis, clinical monitoring of systemic health and to make significant clinical decisions for patient care. More research is required to analyze the potential diagnostic of Covid-19 in saliva to develop rapid chair side tests for the detection of Covid-19 and it is also pivotal to improve and develop successful strategies for prevention, especially for dentists and healthcare professionals who are involved in performing aerosol-generating procedures.","Sri Santosh, Tatikonda; Parmar, Reshu; Anand, Hanish; Srikanth, Konkati; Saritha, Madham",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7708,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164701/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7708,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
389,An Epidemiological Study on COVID-19: A Rapidly Spreading Disease,"Background The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused a major public health crisis worldwide and challenged healthcare systems across the six continents. The high infectivity of the disease led many governments to adopt strict regulations and measures with the aim of containing its spread. The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence, severity, and territorial expansion of COVID-19. Methods Data from the World Health Organization was screened, and COVID-19 situation reports were extracted from January 21 up till March 14 (inclusive). Our data included the total number of cases, total number of new cases, total number of cured cases, and total number of related deaths. Percentage change of cases over the days of our study were calculated using the Joinpoint regression, with a significance level set at greater than 0.05. Results The total number of COVID-19 cases reached 156,622, with 5,845 subsequent deaths. China, Italy, and Iran have the highest number of cases worldwide. During the first 22 days, the incidence rate of COVID-19 increased significantly to reach 1.81 cases per million persons (p<0.001). That was followed by a significant decrease over the next 11 days (p<0.001) to reach 0.071 cases per million persons. A steady rise then followed, which saw a significant increase in incidence rate to 1.429 cases per million persons (p<0.001). Percentages of death and cured cases varied across the different countries; nevertheless, death percentages have generally been decreasing since the start of the crisis. Conclusion Adopting precautionary regulations such as social isolation, increasing sanitation, and employing strict quarantine measures have proved to be beneficial in containing the virus. Further research needs to be conducted to help discover therapeutic modalities and improve outcomes.","Khachfe, Hussein H; Chahrour, Mohamad; Sammouri, Julie; Salhab, Hamza; Makki, Bassel Eldeen; Fares, Mohamad",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7313,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164711/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7313,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

394,The Way Forward,"The concentration of rare earth element in any geological environment alone does not make it suitable for commercial mining. The ease of exploitation is commonly dictated by favourable geological setting, ore grade, tonnage, existing processing technology, costs and attendant environmental concerns including local people. These aspects need to be assessed properly before commencing exploitation. Apart from strengthening downstream sector, upstream sector also need to be developed for identifying and quantifying additional natural resources to sustain “Rare Earth Industry Chain”. This endeavour may also involve innovative groups at the interface of information technology and the minerals, metals and materials engineering domains (cf. Pradip et al. 2019). Assessment of effective recovery of REE and associated metals from industrial wastes and mine dumps, comprising ‘Technospheric mining’, should continue to receive focussed attention. The indigenous manufacturing of intermediate products need to be augmented with matching progressive growth of technological advancements. Industrially speaking, promotion of the “Rare Earth Industry” should be an integral part of the present programme of “Make in India” (Singh 2019). In this regard, a beginning can be made by the AMD-IREL-BARC-NFC-DMRL-ARCI combine. To achieve this goal, several of the industrial partners like Aluminium extraction, Thermal Power Plants, Fertiliser Plants, different Mining Agencies and Steel Plants can also be involved as partners. Also, India can promote its ties with countries, as has been established now with Japan for improving its domain knowledge and new technologies for both upstream and downstream processes of the “Indian Rare Earth Industry”. Significantly, according to REAI News (2020), “2020 looks to be a pivotal year for rare earths”.","Singh, Yamuna",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-41353-8_10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165296/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-41353-8_10,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
395,CT radiomics can help screen the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a preliminary study,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging across the world. The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fang, Mengjie; He, Bingxi; Li, Li; Dong, Di; Yang, Xin; Li, Cong; Meng, Lingwei; Zhong, Lianzhen; Li, Hailin; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-020-2849-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166002/,PMC,10.1007/s11432-020-2849-3,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
396,Safety Profile of Musculoskeletal Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound with Sulfur Hexafluoride Contrast Agent,"PURPOSE: Muscle, bone and tendon regeneration depend on the microperfusion of the corresponding tissue which can be quantified with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent (SonoVue(®)). This study investigated the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in musculoskeletal patients and gives an overview of musculoskeletal CEUS applications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on 13 studies in a standardized monocentric setting, a total of 2268 CEUS examinations in 764 patients were performed and AEs due to the administration of sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent were classified as either mild, moderate or severe. RESULTS: No fatal events occurred. AEs were reported in three cases, of which only one was classified as severe and two as mild. The total rate of all AEs was 0.13% and 0.04% for severe AEs. CONCLUSION: The present analysis confirms the safety of musculoskeletal CEUS using sulfur hexafluoride contrast agent with a lower rate of AEs than that reported for other contrast agents even in elderly patients with concomitant diseases.","Fischer, Christian; Kunz, Pierre; Strauch, Marten; Weber, Marc-André; Doll, Julian",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s235235,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166060/,PMC,10.2147/tcrm.s235235,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14
397,COVID-19 Tragic Pandemic: Concerns over Unintentional “Directed Accelerated Evolution” of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Introducing a Modified Treatment Method for ARDS,"Global health authorities are trying to work out the current status of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission to healthy individuals. In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms. It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve. Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster. Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia. In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv. In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses. Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.","A., Ghadimi-Moghadam; M., Haghani; J.

400,Isolation protocol for a COVID-2019 patient requiring emergent surgical intervention: case presentation,"BACKGROUND: The concerns of the highly contagious and morbid nature of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-2019) have prompted healthcare workers to implement strict droplet and contact isolation precautions. Unfortunately, some patients who may be or presumptively or confirmed as infected with COVID-2019 may also require emergent surgical procedures. As such, given the high-risk for exposure of many healthcare workers involved the complex requirements for appropriate isolation must be adhered to. CASE PRESENTATION: We present our experience with a 77-year-old who required emergency cardiac surgery for a presumed acute aortic syndrome in the setting of a presumed, and eventually confirmed, COVID-2019 infection. We outline the necessary steps to maintain strict isolation precautions to limit potential exposure to the surgical Team. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby provide our algorithm for emergent surgical procedures in critically-ill patients with presumptive or confirmed infection with COVID-2019. The insights from this case report can potentially be templated to other facilities in order to uphold high standards of infection prevention and patient safety in surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Firstenberg, Michael S.; Libby, Matthew; Ochs, Michael; Hanna, Jennifer; Mangino, Julie E.; Forrester, Joseph",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13037-020-00243-9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167216/,PMC,10.1186/s13037-020-00243-9,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 was a need to explore the possible age‐related phenomena with non‐human primate models. METHODS: Three 3‐5 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X‐ray, histopathological changes and immune response. RESULTS: Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after SARS‐CoV‐2 challenge. Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia. Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. CONCLUSION: SARS‐CoV‐2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys. Rhesus macaque models infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 provided insight into the pathogenic mechanism and facilitated the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Yu, Pin; Qi, Feifei; Xu, Yanfeng; Li, Fengdi; Liu, Peipei; Liu, Jiayi; Bao, Linlin; Deng, Wei; Gao, Hong; Xiang, Zhiguang; Xiao, Chong; Lv, Qi; Gong, Shuran; Liu, Jiangning; Song, Zhiqi; Qu, Yajin; Xue, Jing; Wei, Qiang; Liu, Mingya; Wang, Guanpeng; Wang, Shunyi; Yu, Haisheng; Liu, Xing; Huang, Baoying; Wang, Wenling; Zhao, Li; Wang, Huijuan; Ye, Fei; Zhou, Weimin; Zhen, Wei; Han, Jun; Wu, Guizhen; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei; Tan, Wenjie; Qin, Chuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12108,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167234/,PMC,10.1002/ame2.12108,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

The Canadian government underlined that these infectious disease outbreaks are threats to global health security and disrupt societal wellbeing and development. In this context, the Public Health Agency of Canada is proactive and has shown its preparedness for outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, and in dealing with these pathogens. Even before the declaration of pandemic, Canada has proved its global health leadership by ensuring collective action and multisectoral coordination which still remains a serious challenge especially for low and middle- income countries with existing poor health systems.

This has allowed mental health provider agencies, particularly in the states hardest hit so far by the virus that causes COVID‐19, to move more quickly to transition in‐person outpatient services to telehealth.","Enos, Gary",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32305,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168418/,PMC,10.1002/mhw.32305,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
423,COVID‐19 causes more delay in managed care launch for Illinois youth,"The state of Illinois is further delaying the transition to a managed care health coverage system for children in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), this time citing the COVID‐19 outbreak as the reason for delay, the Southern Illinoisan reported March 16. “Recognizing the unprecedented challenges families, medical providers, and state agencies are facing from COVID‐19, the launch of YouthCare services for DCFS youth in care will be postponed a minimum of 30 days,” the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services said in a statement. Most Medicaid recipients in Illinois are already under a managed care system, known as IlliniCare. Under that system, the state pays a flat, monthly per‐patient fee to private insurance companies to manage the care of Medicaid patients. The state has been planning for some time to shift foster children and other minors in the custody of DCFS into a managed care system, YouthCare, but that transition was delayed several times. Those delays have mostly been out of concern that there won't be a large enough network of participating health care providers that can serve the unique physical, mental and behavioral health needs of that population. And so, for now, they remain in a traditional fee‐for‐service coverage plan, DHFS and DCFS officials stated.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32288,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168420/,PMC,10.1002/mhw.32288,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

The TDD‐NCP model was developed recently by Chengąŕs group in Fudan and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). The TDD‐NCP model introduced the time delay process into the differential equations to describe the latent period of the epidemic. The Fudan‐CDCC model was established when Wenbin Chen suggested to determine the kernel functions in the TDD‐NCP model by the public data from CDCC. By the public data of the cumulative confirmed cases in different regions in China and different countries, these models can clearly illustrate that the containment of the epidemic highly depends on early and effective isolations.","Shao, Nian; Zhong, Min; Yan, Yue; Pan, HanShuang; Cheng, Jin; Chen, Wenbin",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mma.6345,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168448/,PMC,10.1002/mma.6345,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
425,North Carolina frees up $30 million for BH during COVID‐19 crisis,"North Carolina's seven regional managed care agencies for behavioral health are receiving $30 million so they can keep a variety of programs running during the COVID‐19 crisis, Carolina Public Press reported March 31. The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high‐quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID‐19 cases rises.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168466/,PMC,10.1002/mhw.32310,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

The effort comes as Trinity Health plans to close 74 pediatric and adult psychiatric beds at Providence Behavioral Health Hospital in Holyoke; Baystate Health seeks the closure of all its mental health beds in Greenfield, Palmer and Westfield; and COVID‐19 places additional pressure on already‐strained emergency departments and other hospital services throughout the region. “These proposed closures would devastate an already‐strained mental health system,” said Cindy Chaplin, RN at Providence and co‐chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee. “Right now, we need to maximize capacity in emergency departments and other hospital units, not decrease services.

434,HSD11B1 is upregulated synergistically by IFNγ and TNFα and mediates TSG-6 expression in human UC-MSCs,"Inflammatory factors such as IFNγ and TNFα could endow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) a potent immunomodulatory property, a process called licensing, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. We here found that glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1), which converts inactive cortisone to the active cortisol and thereby regulates tissue glucocorticoid (GC) levels, was greatly upregulated by IFNγ and TNFα in human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in a synergistic manner. While IFNγ alone was not able to induce HSD11B1, it could increase the activity of NF-kB and thus augment the upregulation of HSD11B1 by TNFα. Interestingly, the upregulation of HSD11B1 by IFNγ and TNFα also required glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, HSD11B1 was shown to be required for the expression of TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), an important anti-inflammatory effector molecule of MSCs. Therefore, the inflammatory factors IFNγ and TNFα can promote GC metabolism and thereby drive the expression of anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 in human UC-MSCs, forming a potential negative feedback loop. These findings help to understand the relationship between inflammation and GC metabolism.","Huang, Peiqing; Li, Yinghong; Xu, Chenchang; Melino, Gerry; Shao, Changshun; Shi, Yufang",https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41420-020-0262-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168568/,PMC,10.1038/s41420-020-0262-7,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

440,Salvage use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 in the USA: a Markov decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA. Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO(2)/FiO(2) (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO(2)/FiO(2) of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature. RESULTS: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.","Choudhury, Rashikh; Barrett, Christopher D.; Moore, Hunter B.; Moore, Ernest E.; McIntyre, Robert C.; Moore, Peter K.; Talmor, Daniel S.; Nydam, Trevor L.; Yaffe, Michael B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13017-020-00305-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169373/,PMC,10.1186/s13017-020-00305-4,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

The effects of substituents, such as ‐F, ‐Br and ‐CH(3), on the crucial characteristics pertaining to the hybrids were investigated through computational studies. In silico or virtual screening through molecular docking studies on the library of 22 compounds, including reference compounds, precursors, non‐hybrid and hybrid derivatives, was performed on DNA G‐quadruplex of the human genome. All six freshly synthesized hybrids showed high binding energy as compared to non‐hybrids as well as reference compounds. The presence of substituents at 5‐position of indole enhanced the binding tendency of the ligand. ADME studies indicated good oral bioavailability and absorption of these compounds. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of hybrids were done at B3LYP/6‐311G++(d,p) level of computation. Their HOMO and LUMO energy plots reflected the presence of high charge transfer and chemical potential. Natural bond order (NBO) calculations predicted hyperconjugative interactions. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) surface plots showed possible electrophilic and nucleophilic attacking sites of the hybrids. Compound 10 a (5‐fluoro‐spiro[indol‐indazole‐thiazolidine]‐dione‐coumarin hybrid), on the basis of global reactivity descriptors, was filtered to be chemically most reactive with the highest binding energy of −8.23 kcal/mol with DNA G‐quadruplex.

451,What did we learn from preparing for cross-border transmission of Ebola virus disease into a complex humanitarian setting – The Republic of South Sudan?,"BACKGROUND: Following the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak (2013–2016), WHO developed a preparedness checklist for its member states. This checklist is currently being applied for the first time on a large and systematic scale to prepare for the cross border importation of the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo hence the need to document the lessons learnt from this experience. This is more pertinent considering the complex humanitarian context and weak health system under which some of the countries such as the Republic of South Sudan are implementing their EVD preparedness interventions. MAIN TEXT: We identified four main lessons from the ongoing EVD preparedness efforts in the Republic South Sudan. First, EVD preparedness is possible in complex humanitarian settings such as the Republic of South Sudan by using a longer-term health system strengthening approach. Second, the Republic of South Sudan is at risk of both domestic and cross border transmission of EVD and several other infectious disease outbreaks hence the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to outbreak preparedness in the country. Third, a phased and well-prioritized approach is required for EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings given the costs associated with preparedness and the difficulties in the accurate prediction of outbreaks in such settings. Fourth, EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings is a massive undertaking that requires effective and decentralized coordination. CONCLUSION: Despite a very challenging context, the Republic of South Sudan made significant progress in its EVD preparedness drive demonstrating that it is possible to rapidly scale up preparedness efforts in complex humanitarian contexts if appropriate and context-specific approaches are used. Further research, systematic reviews and evaluation of the ongoing preparedness efforts are required to ensure comprehensive documentation and application of the lessons learnt for future EVD outbreak preparedness and response efforts.","Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Lako, Richard; Wamala, Joseph Francis; Ramadan, Patrick Otim; Ryan, Caroline; Udenweze, Ifeanyi; Berta, Kibebu; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Sokemawu, Alex; Tukuru, Michael; Gray, Henry John; Chimbaru, Alex",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00657-8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170723/,PMC,10.1186/s40249-020-00657-8,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

453,Adaptation of the National Plan for the Prevention and Fight Against Pandemic Influenza to the 2020 COVID-19 Epidemic in France,"On Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at noon, France became the third European country to impose a nationwide containment policy in the fight against epidemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral infection. Announcing that the country was at “war,” President Macron called upon all to play a role in mitigating against further development of contagion. This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological, and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country. The situation was further complicated by local municipal elections and political agendas by populist opinions. Despite mass communication about the importance of individual behavioral attitudes to counter disease propagation, few heeded government advice. Consequently, the situation rapidly deteriorated with increasing number of cases that started to overwhelm health services. As a result, decisive and immediate action was taken by the State for the national public health interest. This report from the field details the timely events that contributed to this extreme policy decision taken by France. A policy decision that other Western democracies have since applied as the pandemic disseminated across the globe.","Ghanchi, Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.82,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170809/,PMC,10.1017/dmp.2020.82,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

458,Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak,"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. RESULT: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0–7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0–2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6–3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3–3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3–8.5). CONCLUSION: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","Zhang, Chenxi; Yang, Lulu; Liu, Shuai; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Su, Meilei; Zhang, Jihui; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00306,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171048/,PMC,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00306,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

462,"Limited Early Warnings and Public Attention to Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, January–February, 2020: A Longitudinal Cohort of Randomly Sampled Weibo Users","OBJECTIVE: Awareness and attentiveness have implications for the acceptance and adoption of disease prevention and control measures. Social media posts provide a record of the public’s attention to an outbreak. To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related key words in their posts. METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019–February 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23–24, 8–9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6–7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online. CONCLUSION: Limited early warnings represent missed opportunities to engage citizens earlier in the outbreak. Governments should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner.","Zhu, Yuner; Fu, King-Wa; Grépin, Karen A.; Liang, Hai; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",https://www.doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.68,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171227/,PMC,10.1017/dmp.2020.68,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
463,Association between platelet parameters and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019: Retrospective cohort study,"Background: Thrombocytopenia has been implicated in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, while the association of platelet count and changes with subsequent mortality remains unclear. Methods: The clinical and laboratory data of 383 patients with the definite outcome by March 1, 2020 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan were reviewed. The association between platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by utilizing Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: Among the 383 patients, 334 (87.2%) were discharged and survived, and 49 (12.8%) died. Thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality of almost three times as high as that for those without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). Cox regression analyses revealed that platelet count was an independent risk factor associated with in-hospital mortality in a dose-dependent manner. An increment of per 50 × 10(9)/L in platelets was associated with a 40% decrease in mortality (hazard ratio: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.84). Dynamic changes of platelets were also closely related to death during hospitalization. Conclusions: Baseline platelet levels and changes were associated with subsequent mortality. Monitoring platelets during hospitalization may be important in the prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease in 2019.","Liu, Yanli; Sun, Wenwu; Guo, Yanan; Chen, Liangkai; Zhang, Lijuan; Zhao, Su; Long, Ding; Yu, Li",https://www.doi.org/10.1080/09537104.2020.1754383,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171387/,PMC,10.1080/09537104.2020.1754383,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16
464,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and intravascular volume management strategies in the critically ill,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the globe, and millions of people may be affected. While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features and diagnostic tools of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving, uncertainties surrounding various aspects of its optimal management strategies persist. A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs. The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury. As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.","Kazory, Amir; Ronco, Claudio; McCullough, Peter A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2020.1754700,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171388/,PMC,10.1080/08998280.2020.1754700,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16
465,In-silico approaches to detect inhibitors of the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus envelope protein ion channel,"Recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic around the world is associated with ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome’ (SARS-CoV2) in humans. SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped virus and E proteins present in them are reported to form ion channels, which is mainly associated with pathogenesis. Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that α-helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein gets reduced, this, in turn, inhibits the function of the ‘SARS-CoV2 E’ protein. It is pertinent to note that two amino acids, namely VAL25 and PHE26, play a key role while interacting with these three phytochemicals. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) property as well as ‘Lipinski’s Rule of 5s’, they may be utilized as drugs in controlling disease caused via SARS-COV2, after further investigation.

466,Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with COVID-19: Consequences of Viral Toxicities and Host Immune Response,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. SUMMARY: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.","Zhu, Han; Rhee, June-Wha; Cheng, Paul; Waliany, Sarah; Chang, Amy; Witteles, Ronald M.; Maecker, Holden; Davis, Mark M.; Nguyen, Patricia K.; Wu, Sean M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171437/,PMC,10.1007/s11886-020-01292-3,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

468,Combination of Biodata Mining and Computational Modelling in Identification and Characterization of ORF1ab Polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Isolated from Oronasopharynx of an Iranian Patient,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging zoonotic viral infection, which was started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and transmitted to other countries worldwide as a pandemic outbreak. Iran is one of the top ranked countries in the tables of COVID-19-infected and -mortality cases that make the Iranian patients as the potential targets for diversity of studies including epidemiology, biomedical, biodata, and viral proteins computational modelling studies. RESULTS: In this study, we applied bioinformatic biodata mining methods to detect CDS and protein sequences of ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from oronasopharynx of an Iranian patient. Then through the computational modelling and antigenicity prediction approaches, the identified polyprotein sequence was analyzed. The results revealed that the identified ORF1ab polyprotein belongs to a part of nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) with the high antigenicity residues in a glycine-proline or hydrophobic amino acid rich domain. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that nsp1 as a virulence factor and crucial agent in spreading of the COVID-19 among the society can be a potential target for the future epidemiology, drug, and vaccine studies.","Zolfaghari Emameh, Reza; Nosrati, Hassan; Taheri, Ramezan Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12575-020-00121-9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171442/,PMC,10.1186/s12575-020-00121-9,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
469,Influenza species and subtypes circulation among hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital during two influenza seasonal (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) using a multiplex Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction,"The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly with the use of multiplex real-time technique with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. The aim of this study was to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu species between hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital (Iran) between two flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Different respiratory specimens were collected from 540 patients from a period of December 2016 to May 2018 and were sent to the laboratory for molecular diagnosis. RNAs were extracted and subsequently, a multiplex real time PCR identifying flu A, flu B and typing flu A (H1N1) was carried out. The mean age of patients was 47.54±23.96. 216 (40%) and 321 (60%) of subjects were male and female, respectively. 219 out of 540 (40.5%) were positive for influenza infection including flu A (n=97, 44.3%), flu A (H1N1) (n=45, 20.7%) and flu B (n=77, 35%). Flu A was the dominant species on 2016-2017 and flu B was the major species on 2017-2018. Flu A (H1N1) was comparable in both time periods. Flu infections were most frequently diagnosed in age groups 21-40. Flu-positive patients suffered more from body pain and sore throat than flunegative patients with significant statistical difference (P values <0.001). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter for flu-positive patients (P value = 0.016). Application of multiplex real time PCR could facilitate the influenza diagnosis in a short period of time, benefiting patients from exclusion of bacterial infections and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections, suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients.","Azhar, Iman Rezaee; Mohraz, Minoo; Mardani, Masoud; Tavakoli, Mohammad Ali; Afshar, Amin Ehteshami; Zamani, Mohammad; Sadeghpoor, Simin; Safari, Saeid; Dadashpoor, Roozbeh; Rezaee, Mahsa; Shirvani, Fariba; Azimi, Shohreh; Heydarifard, Zahra; Ranjbar, Hamidreza Hagh; Lotfi, Amir Hossain; Mosadegh, Farhad; Hashemnejad, Farhad; Jazayeri, Seyed Mohammad",https://www.doi.org/10.4081/idr.2020.8139,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171471/,PMC,10.4081/idr.2020.8139,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
470,Baby pangolins on my plate: possible lessons to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic,"The Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine (JEET), throughout its 15 years of existence, has tried to provide a respected outlet for scientific knowledge concerning the inextricable links between human societies and nature, food, and health. Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings’ existence.","Volpato, Gabriele; Fontefrancesco, Michele F.; Gruppuso, Paolo; Zocchi, Dauro M.; Pieroni, Andrea",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-020-00366-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171915/,PMC,10.1186/s13002-020-00366-4,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

475,Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Causative Virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Human Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens Using Field-Effect Transistor-Based Biosensor,"[Image: see text] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously called 2019-nCoV). Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 10(1) pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 × 10(2) copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.","Seo, Giwan; Lee, Geonhee; Kim, Mi Jeong; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Choi, Minsuk; Ku, Keun Bon; Lee, Chang-Seop; Jun, Sangmi; Park, Daeui; Kim, Hong Gi; Kim, Seong-Jun; Lee, Jeong-O; Kim, Bum Tae; Park, Edmond Changkyun; Kim, Seung Il",https://www.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02823,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172500/,PMC,10.1021/acsnano.0c02823,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

477,Staffing With Disease-Based Epidemiologic Indices May Reduce Shortage of Intensive Care Unit Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Health care worker (HCW) safety is of pivotal importance during a pandemic such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and employee health and well-being ensure functionality of health care institutions. This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10%, 25%, and 40% being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17%, 32%, and 38% staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Staffing along epidemiologic considerations may reduce HCW shortage by leveling the nadir of affected workforce. Although this requires considerable efforts and commitment of staff, it may be essential in an effort to best maintain staff health and operational functionality of health care facilities and systems.","Mascha, Edward J.; Schober, Patrick; Schefold, Joerg C.; Stueber, Frank; Luedi, Markus M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004849,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173088/,PMC,10.1213/ane.0000000000004849,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

(Fabaceae/Leguminosae): (Syns.: G. glandulifera Waldst. & Kit.; G. hirsuta Pall.; G. pallida Boiss. & Noe; G. violacea Boiss. & Noe),"Liquorice is a perennial, temperate-zone herb or subshrub, native of India, Pakistan and southern Europe; also cultivated in England, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. It has also been grown experimentally in the United States. Ancient historical manuscripts from China, India and Greece mention its use for symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. The plant has also been described by Theophrastus. Licorice from Egypt has been described to be the best, followed by from Iraq and Syria; the root should be decorticated before use. It concocts viscid humours in diseases of liver, bladder and lungs, and expectorates them. It has been used in Iranian herbal medicine for skin eruptions, including dermatitis, eczema, pruritus and cysts, and for treatment of stomach disorders including peptic ulcers. The herb extract inhibits gastric motility in vivo, which is regarded to be an important aspect for its antiulcer activity. Licorice possesses both anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activities; whereas most anti-inflammatory agents are ulcerogenic. Former German Commission E believed it to be effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Licorice root has been used for years to regulate gastrointestinal function in TCM, has been used for generations as an antidote, demulcent, and elixir in folk medicine of China, and is the most commonly used crude drug in Kampo Medicines, the Japanese form of modified TCM, for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Roots contain glycyrrhizin, the main water-soluble constituent that is 50× sweeter than sugar, 2-β-glucuronosyl glucuronic acid, and isoliquiritigenin-4-glucoside. Glycyrrhizin is a nonhemolytic saponin with foaming property, and one of the most potent hydroxyl radical scavengers. No significant effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice was observed on gastric ulcer in an RCT of British patients. Treatment of healthy men with licorice for one-week decreased salivary testosterone values by 26% but no significant decrease in free testosterone, and nine healthy women treated with licorice daily for two cycles, had their mean total serum testosterone decreased by 37% at the end of 2nd month. This property could be useful as an adjunct therapy of hirsutism and PCOS.","Akbar, Shahid",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16807-0_103,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173723/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-16807-0_103,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Important areas of the industry and service sectors were partially or completely shutdown. A resumption of activity should happen as soon as possible, once the medical pre-conditions have been established and are met. This requires a clear exit strategy and following several steps to return to previous welfare and growth data levels. After securing survival during this crisis via various liquidity lines and bridging loans, the economy’s restart requires the relaunch of public infrastructure, especially of schools and kindergartens. To facilitate a coordinated and synchronised restart of complex industrial value chains, we need clear signals on a planned schedule.

In the face of COVID-19, cancer patients are likely to be affected in three key ways: access to healthcare, increased financial toxicity and increased mental health burden as a consequence of strict measures being implemented to contain the virus in Ghana, including partial lockdowns and social distancing. Some cultural beliefs regarding COVID-19 and its influence on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients have also been discussed. Measures by the government to lessen the burden on citizens and health workers are highlighted with possible recommendations for improvement in cancer care in Ghana and other LMICs during this pandemic.","Kugbey, Nuworza; Ohene-Oti, Naomi; Vanderpuye, Verna",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed99,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176065/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed99,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
514,Trends and Prediction in Daily New Cases and Deaths of COVID-19 in the United States: An Internet Search-Interest Based Model,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The daily incidence and deaths of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the USA are poorly understood. Internet search interest was found to be correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but has not yet been applied to the USA. Therefore, we examined the association of internet search-interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the USA. METHODS: We extracted COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA from two population-based datasets, namely 1-point-3-acres.com and the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository. The internet search-interest of COVID-19-related terms was obtained using Google Trends. The Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict trends, respectively. RESULTS: There were 636,282 new cases and,325 deaths of COVID-19 in the USA from March 1 to April 15, 2020, with a crude mortality of 4.45%. The daily new cases peaked at 35,098 cases on April 10, 2020 and the daily deaths peaked at 2,494 on April 15, 2020. The search interest of COVID, “COVID pneumonia” and “COVID heart” were correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence, with 12 or 14 days of delay (Pearson’s r = 0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19 days of delay (Pearson’s r = 0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The 7-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed no significant correlations of the observed data with the predicted daily new cases or daily deaths, using search interest of COVID, COVID heart, and COVID pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Xu, Jie; Hussain, Sabiha; Wang, He; Gao, Nan; Zhang, Lanjing",https://www.doi.org/10.14218/erhm.2020.00023,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176069/,PMC,10.14218/erhm.2020.00023,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

This report retrospectively addresses measures that were progressively put in place to modify in a week time the activity of a busy orthopaedic department in a large tertiary university hospital in face of the pandemic. Surgical priorities and surgical outcomes are key aspects to consider. The experience may offer some insight to areas where the spread of the disease may be slower or delayed. Abrupt stop of scheduled surgery and clinics is useful to adapt an orthopaedic department to the overall hospital resource reorganization. Orthopaedic surgeons need to be aware of the risks to patients and personnel in view of underdiagnosed cases, which make pre-operative Covid-19 evaluation mandatory for all surgical cases.","Gómez-Barrena, Enrique; Rubio-Suárez, Juan C; Fernández-Baillo, Nicomedes; Antuña, Samuel; Cruz-Pardos, Ana; Blanco, Manuel; Ortiz-Cruz, Eduardo; González-Morán, Gaspar; Gil-Garay, Enrique",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/jscr/rjaa095,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176478/,PMC,10.1093/jscr/rjaa095,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

527,Teaching Professional Formation in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges has called for a temporary suspension of clinical teaching activities for medical students. Planning for the continued involvement of learners in patient care during this pandemic should include teaching learners professional formation. The authors provide an ethical framework to guide such teaching, based on the ethical principle of beneficence and the professional virtues of courage and self-sacrifice from professional ethics in medicine. The authors show that these concepts support the conclusion that learners are ethically obligated to accept reasonable, but not unreasonable, risk. Based on this ethical framework, the authors provide an account of the process of teaching professional formation that medical educators and academic leaders should implement. Medical educators and academic leaders should embrace the opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for teaching professional formation. Learners should acquire the conceptual vocabulary of professional formation. Learners should recognize that risk of infection from patients is unavoidable. Learners should become aware of established ethical standards for professional responsibility during epidemics from the history of medicine. Learners should master understandable fear. Medical educators and academic leaders should ensure that didactic teaching of professional formation continues when it becomes justified to end learners’ participation in the processes of patient care; topics should include the professionally responsible management of scarce medical resources. The COVID-19 pandemic will not be the last major infectious disease that puts learners at risk. Professional ethics in medicine provides powerful conceptual tools that can be used as an ethical framework to guide medical educators to teach learners, who will bear leadership responsibilities in responses to future pandemics, professional formation.","McCullough, Laurence B.; Coverdale, John; Chervenak, Frank A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003434,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179059/,PMC,10.1097/acm.0000000000003434,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

The incubation period varies between 2 days and 14 days. Symptoms usually include fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome. Older age and co-morbid conditions increase the fatality. Any person with a history of travel to and from COVID-19 affected countries in the past 14 days or any person who has had close contact with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 are suspect cases and needs evaluation.

This deadly virus caused the world to be in high alert as the death toll and the number of confirmed cases is continuously rising since the first case was reported. The Chinese government warned that the transmission ability of the virus is increasing, and international efforts are needed to overcome this outbreak. The purpose of this review is to focus on the published articles about the new virus, which will give an insight into the current state of research and data available, as well as recommending future studies. METHODS: For this narrative review, more than 20 relevant scientific articles and reports were considered from various databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct) using keywords such as Coronavirus Outbreak, COVID-19, Emerging Epidemics, Emerging Infections, and Novel Coronavirus. RESULTS: The results from this review show that the situation is rapidly evolving, as human-to-human transmission is occurring, and the number of new cases and mortalities is increasing by the day and on a global level. There is still ambiguity about mutation risks and how the virus spreads as the source was not yet identified.

542,Nationwide system to centralize decisions around ECMO use for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Japan (Special Correspondence),"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading in Japan. We have collected a total of 26 patients with COVID-19 who required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH(2)O, 21 cmH(2)O, and 28 mL/cmH(2)O, respectively. Median serum KL-6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID-19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO. Further investigation is necessary to clasrify the optimal use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40560-020-00445-4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7180634/,PMC,10.1186/s40560-020-00445-4,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
543,To Tweet or Not to Tweet—a Review of the Viral Power of Twitter for Infectious Diseases,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With real-time communication crucial to both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and the public in infectious diseases (ID), social media networking sites has become even more important. Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. RECENT FINDINGS: Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. SUMMARY: Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to “social”ize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.","Kullar, Ravina; Goff, Debra A.; Gauthier, Timothy P.; Smith, Tara C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11908-020-00723-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7180651/,PMC,10.1007/s11908-020-00723-0,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

549,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Implications for Gynaecologic Cancer Care,"PURPOSE: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on world healthcare system and economy is unprecedented. Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. METHODS: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. RESULTS: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a “do no harm” approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time. CONCLUSION: Currently available evidence is limited by small sample size, and full impact of this pandemic on cancer is yet to be seen. However, cancer care needs to be individualized taking all variables into consideration.","Bhatla, Neerja; Singhal, Seema",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40944-020-00395-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7180676/,PMC,10.1007/s40944-020-00395-7,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
550,Being a front-line dentist during the Covid-19 pandemic: a literature review,"Coronavirus is an enveloped virus with positive-sense single-stranded RNA. Coronavirus infection in humans mainly affects the upper respiratory tract and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical symptoms of coronavirus infections can range from relatively mild (similar to the common cold) to severe (bronchitis, pneumonia, and renal involvement). The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was called Covid-19 by the World Health Organization in February 2020. Face-to-face communication and consistent exposure to body fluids such as blood and saliva predispose dental care workers at serious risk for 2019-nCoV infection. As demonstrated by the recent coronavirus outbreak, information is not enough. During dental practice, blood and saliva can be scattered. Accordingly, dental practice can be a potential risk for dental staff, and there is a high risk of cross-infection. This article addresses all information collected to date on the virus, in accordance with the guidelines of international health care institutions, and provides a comprehensive protocol for managing possible exposure to patients or those suspected of having coronavirus.","Fallahi, Hamid Reza; Keyhan, Seied Omid; Zandian, Dana; Kim, Seong-Gon; Cheshmi, Behzad",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40902-020-00256-5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7180678/,PMC,10.1186/s40902-020-00256-5,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

First reported at the end of December 2019 as a cause for clusters of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city in China, the rapid spread of this condition was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO). Apart from the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19, the massive social and financial havoc inflicted by this pandemic has left the entire world pondering if medical science can innovate and curtail the ongoing damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Recent findings of an open-label study that investigated the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in Marseille, France, has garnered some optimism in scientific quarters and the general public alike in terms of finding a treatment regimen to control the rampant rise of COVID-19.

558,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): An Update,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus. They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans. The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats. The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals. It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling. Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications. The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease. Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients. Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.","Pal, Mahendra; Berhanu, Gemechu; Desalegn, Chaltu; Kandi, Venkataramana",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7423,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182166/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7423,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26
559,Conclusion and Afterword,"The previous chapters contain a great deal of medical, socioeconomic, demographic, epidemiologic, racial, ethnic, educational, and cultural information pertaining particularly to the black population of the United States, but it is admittedly somewhat incomplete. There is so much more that might have been included, but space and time limitations preclude a more comprehensive coverage of everything that touches upon the healthcare scene involving black Americans.

560,Outstanding Black Physicians and Other Health Professionals in American History,"An attempt to create a list of the best or most important or most accomplished people in any field will be met with questions about why certain individuals were excluded or, indeed, why some were even included. No list of this type will ever satisfy everyone. However, the thought about who the best physicians are and were is often raised, and it certainly is pertinent in a book on blacks in medicine. We sometimes refer to standout physicians in terms of their demonstrated ability to overcome adversity while accomplishing enormous gains in their careers, against all odds in many cases. Many are called visionaries. What metrics should we use? Often the term “great” is used to describe an individual physician’s attributes. However, if greatness can be defined as extraordinary competence sustained over time, many of those who had only a relatively brief opportunity to demonstrate their expertise would not make the list, although their singular accomplishment may have been groundbreaking. So perhaps a broader criterion should be used, one that does not require a long-term application of medical prowess. I would like to suggest what that overarching criterion should be: it is the unequivocal impact that an individual physician has had in saving and rescuing the lives and health of African American and other minority, vulnerable, needy, and impoverished people, and contributing in a measurable manner to their health and well-being, either by involvement as a medical practitioner, researcher, educator, or academic standout or through leadership and activism as a champion for social justice.","Williams, Richard Allen",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-41960-8_6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182344/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-41960-8_6,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25

565,Continuity of Constitutional Government during a Pandemic: Considering the Concept in Canada's Emergency Management Act,"This research note examines the undefined meaning of the government's obligations to ensure “continuity of constitutional government” (CCG) as provided for in section 4(l) of the Emergency Management Act, S.C. 2007, c. 15 (Canada, 2007). Specifically, that section gives the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness the responsibility for “establishing the necessary arrangements for the continuity of constitutional government in the event of an emergency,” but the term is itself undefined. The article will canvass the origin of the term and its relationship to other so-called continuity of government (COG) concepts, along with some legal written opinion on what the term might in practice mean, should the minister ever be charged with discharging this responsibility. It will conclude with some final thoughts on the relevance of the CCG concept to the current pandemic. Given that the COVID-19 virus has infected Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the prime minister's wife, forced a drastically reduced and possibly “virtual” federal Parliament, placed the British prime minister in intensive care and led to the self-isolation of many world leaders, the topic is relevant to Canada in 2020.","McDougall, Andrew",https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s0008423920000293,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184142/,PMC,10.1017/s0008423920000293,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

579,Recommendations from the CSO-HNS taskforce on performance of tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"INTRODUCTION: The performance of tracheotomy is a common procedural request by critical care departments to the surgical services of general surgery, thoracic surgery and otolaryngology - head & neck surgery. A Canadian Society of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery (CSO-HNS) task force was convened with multi-specialty involvement from otolaryngology-head & neck surgery, general surgery, critical care and anesthesiology to develop a set of recommendations for the performance of tracheotomies during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients. Pre-operative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended for any non-emergent procedure. CONCLUSION: The set of recommendations in this document highlight the importance of avoiding tracheotomy procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive if at all possible. Recommendations for appropriate PPE and environment are made for COVID-19 positive, negative and unknown patients requiring consideration of tracheotomy. The safety of healthcare professionals who care for ill patients and who keep critical infrastructure operating is paramount.","Sommer, D. D.; Engels, P. T.; USAF, Colonel E.K.

600,Analysis of the susceptibility of lung cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 patients with lung cancer have a higher risk of severe events than patients without cancer. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Lung cancer patients in each age stage, subtype, and pathological stage are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the primitive subtype of LUSC. LUAD patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than LUSC patients. The findings are unanimous on tissue expression in gene and protein levels.","Kong, Qi; Xiang, Zhiguang; Wu, Yue; Gu, Yu; Guo, Jianguo; Geng, Fei",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12943-020-01209-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186321/,PMC,10.1186/s12943-020-01209-2,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
601,Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 in a wide variety of human tissues,"BACKGROUND: Since its discovery in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 2 180 000 people worldwide and has caused more than 150 000 deaths as of April 16, 2020. SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells. Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We compared ACE2 expression levels across 31 normal human tissues between males and females and between younger (ages ≤ 49 years) and older (ages > 49 years) persons using two-sided Student’s t test. We also investigated the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune signatures in various tissues using Pearson’s correlation test. RESULTS: ACE2 expression levels were the highest in the small intestine, testis, kidneys, heart, thyroid, and adipose tissue, and were the lowest in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscle. ACE2 showed medium expression levels in the lungs, colon, liver, bladder, and adrenal gland. ACE2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older persons in any tissue. In the skin, digestive system, brain, and blood vessels, ACE2 expression levels were positively associated with immune signatures in both males and females. In the thyroid and lungs, ACE2 expression levels were positively and negatively associated with immune signatures in males and females, respectively, and in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs and infect persons with different sexes, ages, and races equally. The different host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain why males and females, young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity. This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Li, Meng-Yuan; Li, Lin; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Xiao-Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00662-x,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186534/,PMC,10.1186/s40249-020-00662-x,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
602,COVID-19: ICU delirium management during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2-causing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged as a public health threat in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Delirium, a dangerous untoward prognostic development, serves as a barometer of systemic injury in critical illness. The early reports of 25% encephalopathy from China are likely a gross underestimation, which we know occurs whenever delirium is not monitored with a valid tool. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 are at accelerated risk for delirium due to at least seven factors including (1) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion, (2) induction of CNS inflammatory mediators, (3) secondary effect of other organ system failure, (4) effect of sedative strategies, (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation time, (6) immobilization, and (7) other needed but unfortunate environmental factors including social isolation and quarantine without family. Given early insights into the pathobiology of the virus, as well as the emerging interventions utilized to treat the critically ill patients, delirium prevention and management will prove exceedingly challenging, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). The main focus during the COVID-19 pandemic lies within organizational issues, i.e., lack of ventilators, shortage of personal protection equipment, resource allocation, prioritization of limited mechanical ventilation options, and end-of-life care. However, the standard of care for ICU patients, including delirium management, must remain the highest quality possible with an eye towards long-term survival and minimization of issues related to post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This article discusses how ICU professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacologists) can use our knowledge and resources to limit the burden of delirium on patients by reducing modifiable risk factors despite the imposed heavy workload and difficult clinical challenges posed by the pandemic.","Kotfis, Katarzyna; Williams Roberson, Shawniqua; Wilson, Jo Ellen; Dabrowski, Wojciech; Pun, Brenda T.; Ely, E.

METHODS: We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. RESULTS: The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation.

The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time. AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis. In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086133/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.01,20/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-20

METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSION: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086131/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06,20/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-20

METHOD: We analyzed the clinical and chest CT data of 6 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. According to the time from the disease onset to the cure or from the onset to each CT scan, the total of 30 chest CT scans were divided into 4 stages, namely stage 1 (0-4 days), stage 2 (5-9 days), stage 3 (10-14 days), and stage 4 (over 14 days). A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively assess the pulmonary involvement on the basis of the involved area. The differences in chest CT signs and the lung injury scores based on CT findings were compared among the 4 stages. RESULTS: In stage 1, ground-glass opacities (GGO) was found frequently in the subpleura, and the CT score was the lowest at 4.00±0.40. Stage 2 was characterized by an increased and mixed density (crazy-paving pattern) with mild consolidation of the lungs, and the CT score reached its peak level of 7.38±3.34 (P < 0.05). In stage 3, an expanded range of consolidation and linear lesions were found in the lungs, and the total CT score averaged 6.86±2.91. In stage 4, a gradual resolution of the consolidation occurred with more linear lesions in the lungs, and the total CT score was 6.21±1.56. The CT scores of the lower lobes were significantly higher compared with those of the middle/upper lobes (P < 0.05) in stage 3 and stage 4. CONCLUSION: Chest CT scans allows dynamic monitoring of the changes in the distribution, density and extent of the pulmonary lesions in the 4 stages, which are closely correlated with the evolution of the disease course of COVID-19.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.05,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167320/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.05,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

618,蒲公英果实征：9例新型冠状病毒肺炎的CT征象,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of the ""dandelion clock-like"" sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.

619,Atypical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report,"BACKGROUND: The first case of pneumonia subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 8, 2019. The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient’s son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19. Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.","Li, Rui-Lin; Chu, Shu-Guang; Luo, Yu; Huang, Zhen-Hao; Hao, Ying; Fan, Cheng-Hui",https://www.doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i7.1265,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176616/,PMC,10.12998/wjcc.v8.i7.1265,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

622,新型冠状病毒SARS-CoV-2的变异和进化分析,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evolution and variation of SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic starting at the end of 2019. METHODS: We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of β Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus.

626,传染病爆发流行期间的临床研究方法与卫生经济学考量,"In the setting of epidemics of communicable diseases, early initiation of epidemiological and clinical data collection and analysis and conducting relevant researches are essential to the success of epidemic containment. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology. The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic. Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process. RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks. We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks. The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures. The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies. Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks. We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.11,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167318/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.11,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.

METHODS: We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol. The whole blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma with or without prior heat inactivation, or only the separated plasma was heat inactivated. Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 ℃ for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol. The plasma standard and quality control samples were inactivated in an identical manner and tested with LC-MS/MS along with the treated samples. RESULTS: The optimized method showed a high imprecision (with mean intra- and inter-day imprecisions of 3.59% and 2.81%, respectively) and a high accuracy (mean 97.37%) for detecting voriconazole in the inactivated samples at different concentration levels. Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%). The measured voriconazole concentrations in inactivated whole blood, inactivated plasma and the samples without inactivation all showed good linear correlations with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. CONCLUSION: Heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.08,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167328/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.08,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

641,重型和危重型COVID-19患者实施气管插管的临床经验,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving tracheal intubation. METHODS: We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded. The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients. The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded. RESULTS: The average ages of these patients were 70.39±8.02 years. Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%. Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation. Tracheotomy was performed in one patient. Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation. A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far. CONCLUSION: For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality. Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety. The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.07,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167317/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.07,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in 11 patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 patients with diseases other than COVID- 19 in our hospital. We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min. In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples. RESULTS: With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively. For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P < 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation. CONCLUSION: Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators. Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167315/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.03,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

METHODS: The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020. According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type. The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea. Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments. Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05). The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).

It is one of the most common human illnesses with its greatest impact on the very young and elderly. In the developing world, VGE can be life threatening whereas in most developed countries, it is self-limited and managed with hydration. Most agents of VGE are spread by the fecal oral route or may occur in explosive outbreaks due to food or water contamination. Control of these infections depends upon proper food handling, hand hygiene, clean water and the rotavirus vaccination of infants. This chapter will discuss the common viruses which cause this syndrome.","Orenstein, Robert",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65973-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65973-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65973-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

651,Chapter 1 Introduction to virus origins and their role in biological evolution,"Abstract Viruses are diverse parasites of cells and extremely abundant. They might have arisen during an early phase of the evolution of life on Earth dominated by ribonucleic acid or RNA-like macromolecules, or when a cellular world was already well established. The theories of the origin of life on Earth shed light on the possible origin of primitive viruses or virus-like genetic elements in our biosphere. Some features of present-day viruses, notably error-prone replication, might be a consequence of the selective forces that mediated their ancestral origin. Two views on the role of viruses in our biosphere predominate; viruses considered as opportunistic, selfish elements, and viruses considered as active participants in the construction of the cellular world via the lateral transfer of genes. These two models have a bearing on viruses being considered predominantly as disease agents or predominantly as cooperators in the shaping of differentiated cellular organisms.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00001-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00001-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00001-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

653,Chapter 17 Effective control of waterborne pathogens by aquatic plants,"Abstract The role of aquatic plants in treating wastewater contaminated with inorganic and organic pollutants is well established. Recent studies have shown that aquatic plants possess potential to remove pathogens from wastewater. High removal (90%) of pathogenic microbes such as Enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella have been achieved using aquatic plant species viz. Typha latifolia, Cyperus papyrus, Cyperus alternifolius, Phragmites mauritianus, Pistia stratiotes, Lemna paucicostata, Spirodela polyrhiza, Eichhornia crassipes. Pathogen removal by aquatic plants mainly occurs because of toxicity exerted by exudates produced by them or attachment of pathogens to plant roots followed by filtration. Constructed wetlands have proved very efficient in treating pathogen-contaminated water. More studies are required to find out the exact mechanism of pathogen removal by these plants so that their role in phytoremediation technologies can be emphasized.","Dhir, Bhupinder",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00017-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00017-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00017-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
654,Chapter 21 Nanofiltration technology for removal of pathogens present in drinking water,"Abstract Water is one of the most important natural resources supporting the diverse array of life present on earth. Rapid diminution of fresh potable water reserves, contamination of existing ones, and generation of large amount of wastewater due to anthropogenic activities have compelled the scientists to develop methods to treat the contaminated water. Across the globe, millions of people are inaccessible to fresh drinking water. Multiple health issues are linked with the purification of drinking water supplied through different ways including bottled water, tap water, and borewells. The drinking water is most often contaminated with pathogenic microbes including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa beyond the recommended limits causing serious human health hazards. The pathogenic microbes commonly detected in water supplies include those related to dysentery, typhoid fever, vomiting, and cholera. Therefore, removal of human pathogens from drinking water is essential for health security. Numbers of physical and chemical techniques have been developed to make available the pathogen free drinking water. Techniques employing membranes for trapping hazardous biological contaminant are currently gaining momentum worldwide. This chapter deals with the sources of pathogens in drinking water, important waterborne diseases, and different aspects of nanofiltration techniques over other commercially used methods for removal of pathogens.","Singh, Rishikesh; Bhadouria, Rahul; Singh, Pardeep; Kumar, Ajay; Pandey, Shilpi; Singh, Vipin Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00021-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00021-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00021-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
655,L’usage récréatif du cannabis: des effets aux méfaits Données épidémiologiques*,"RÉSUMÉ À l’heure où l’usage médical de la plante « cannabis dit thérapeutique » est pratiquement acté dans notre pays, l’ouverture à son usage récréatif constitue la suite logique, à l’image de la chronologie toujours suivie dans tous les pays. En effet, ceux qui ont légalisé la drogue - le végétal - ont auparavant approuvé son emploi en thérapeutique, étape de « justification » qui semble incontournable. Il nous a donc paru opportun de rappeler les effets et les méfaits de la drogue dans le cadre de son usage récréatif. Les enquêtes en population générale réalisées en France depuis 25 ans par Santé publique France et l’Observatoire français des drogues et toxicomanies, permettent de suivre l’évolution de la consommation de substances psychoactives. Une attention toute particulière est portée aux usages de cannabis qui, dans un contexte de large diffusion depuis un quart de siècle n’ont cessé de progresser parmi les jeunes générations, mais également parmi les adultes plus âgés. La France est le pays européen dont la prévalence de consommation de cannabis est la plus élevée chez les jeunes et les adultes. En 25 ans, sa diffusion n’a cessé de s’étendre et le taux d’expérimentation a été pratiquement multiplié par 4. Estimé à 12,7 % en 1992, il atteint 44,8 % en 2017. De surcroît, en 2017, ce sont 25 % des usagers dans l’année de 18 à 64 ans qui présentent un risque élevé d’usage problématique ou de dépendance. Ce chiffre est inquiétant car il est en progression constante, il affecte 3 % des 18-64 ans, soit un peu plus d’un million de personnes. SUMMARY As the medical use of so called “therapeutic cannabis"" is in the process of being approved in France, the opening to its recreational use is the next logical step, as it has been always the chronology followed in all countries. Indeed, those who have legalized the drug have previously approved its therapeutic use. This 'justifying a project phase' stage seems unavoidable. Therefore, it is appropriate to recall the effects and misdeeds of the drug during its recreational use. The general population surveys carried out in France for 25 years by public health France and the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction, have followed the evolution of psychoactive substances consumption. Particular attention was focused on cannabis use, which, in a context of wide dissemination for a quarter of a century, rose steadily higher among younger generations, but also among older adults. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of cannabis use among young people and adults. Last 25 years, its diffusion has continued to expand, and the experimentation rate multiplied by near 4. Estimated at 12.7% in 1992, it reached 44.8% in 2017. Moreover, 25% of users in the year aged from 18 to 64 years old were at high risk of problematic use or dependence in 2017. This figure is worrying because it is constantly increasing; it affects 3% of 18-64-year-old, just over a million people.","Goullé, Jean-Pierre; Guerbet, Michel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.001,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
656,Cannabis et neurodéveloppement,"Résumé Le développement cérébral est un phénomène complexe, qui s’étend de la vie fœtale à l’adolescence, pendant laquelle la maturation cérébrale suit une série d’événements ordonnés incluant des périodes critiques de plasticité. Le cerveau est particulièrement sensible à l’environnement pendant ces remaniements. Le système endocannabinoïde participe directement et indirectement à ces processus de plasticité et de maturation. Le delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol, principal composant psychoactif du cannabis, diffuse dans le placenta, le lait maternel et le cerveau. Il interagit avec le système endocannabinoïde, notamment par l’activation des récepteurs aux cannabinoïdes 1 CB1R, ce qui peut entraîner des altérations du neurodéveloppement et du fonctionnement des circuits neuronaux. Par conséquent, l’exposition au cannabis in utero, en période périnatale ainsi qu’à l’adolescence est susceptible d’entraîner des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale dont les conséquences, sur le plan cognitif, psychotique et addictif, persistent bien au-delà de la période d’exposition. Plusieurs facteurs modulent le risque de telles complications mais les études réalisées sur des modèles animaux ainsi que chez l’homme ont montré qu’une exposition durant les phases critiques, en particulier durant la phase de développement périnatal et à l’adolescence, constitue en soi un facteur de risque. Les données actuelles incitent à diffuser une information objective aux jeunes, pour prévenir et limiter les consommations précoces. Summary Brain development is a complex phenomenon, stretching from fetal life to adolescence, during which brain maturation proceeds through a series of ordered events including critical periods of plasticity. The brain is particularly sensitive to the environment during these changes. The endocannabinoid system participates directly and indirectly in these plasticity and maturation processes. The main psychoactive component of cannabis, the delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol, can cross the placental barrier, is present in breastmilk and diffuses in the brain. It interacts with the endocannabinoid signaling, especially through the activation of cannabinoid receptors 1 CB1R, which can lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental processes and neuronal circuits functions. Therefore, exposure to cannabis in utero, in perinatal phase, as well as during the adolescence disrupts the brain maturation and can cause disturbances on the cognitive, psychotic and addictive levels that persist far beyond the period of exposure. Several factors modulate the risk of such complications, but studies performed in animal models as well as in human cohorts have shown that exposure during both the critical perinatal and adolescence phases is a risk factor per se. Current knowledge encourages the dissemination of objective information to young people, to prevent and limit early exposure and its consequences.","Krebs, M.-O.; Demars, F.; Frajerman, A.; Kebir, O.; Jay, T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
657,Cannabis et cannabinoïdes de synthèse. À propos de leur détection biologique,"Résumé Parmi la soixantaine de cannabinoïdes présents dans le cannabis sativa indica on trouve essentiellement des terpénophénols, parmi lesquels figure le delta-9-trans tétrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) qui constitue le principal produit psychoactif chez l’homme. Depuis une dizaine d’années, avec l’émergence du e-commerce et la recherche pharmaceutique sur des médicaments originaux, des dérivés synthétiques du Δ9-THC ont fait leur apparition. Ces molécules, sous le nom générique anglo-saxon de « spices », ont des structures chimiques très différentes, mais se lient toutes sur les mêmes récepteurs CB1 et CB2. Elles miment les effets du Δ9-THC, avec des effets pharmacologiques plus puissants, et donc des effets secondaires bien plus délétères et des durées d’action augmentées. L’usage de tous les cannabinoïdes est contrôlé, ce qui nécessite de disposer de méthodes analytiques performantes pour leur détection. L’objet de cette mini revue est de faire le point sur les possibilités actuelles de mise en évidence et de discuter, en fonction de la matrice biologique utilisée (sang, urine, salive, sueur, air expiré, cheveux) des avantages et des limitations de chaque approche. Summary Among the 60 or so various cannabinoids which are present in cannabis sativa indica, terpenophenols are mainly found, including delta-9-trans tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) which is the major psychoactive ingredient. Over the last decade, due to the emergence of e-commerce and the continuous investigations by pharmaceutical groups to identify new active molecules, synthetic cannabinoids have been proposed. These compounds, under the generic name “spices” have chemical structures very different from that of Δ9-THC, but share the same CB1 and CB2 receptors. They are mimics of Δ9-THC with much powerful pharmacological effects, including thus more deterrent side-effects, and enhanced windows of detection. All these drugs are controlled. This means that they have to be tested in human biological specimens to document abuse. The aim of this mini-review is to present what has been described in the scientific literature according to the available specimens (blood, urine, saliva, sweat, hair and exhaled breath), focussing on the current advantages and limitations of each test.","Kintz, P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.003,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16
658,Les effets épigénétiques du cannabis / tétrahydrocannabinol,"Résumé La diffusion, sur un mode quasi pandémique, du cannabis chez les adolescents et adultes jeunes, spécialement en France, justifie l’attention portée aux conséquences, non seulement aiguës, mais également différées de cette intoxication. Dans cette dernière éventualité interviennent des mécanismes épigénétiques. On rappellera d’abord différents types de modifications épigénétiques portant soit sur les histones de la chromatine, principalement des méthylations ou des acétylations ; soit sur l’ADN, par méthylation des cytosines. Des modifications de ce type suscitées par le tétrahydrocannabinol/THC du cannabis peuvent intervenir : soit au niveau des gamètes avant la procréation ; soit sur le fœtus pendant la gestation ; soit à différents moments de la vie de l’individu. À certaine de ces modifications épigénétiques est associé un accroissement de la vulnérabilité aux toxicomanies, impliquant les récepteurs D2 de la dopamine dans le noyau accumbens ; une surexpression de la synthèse du précurseur des enképhalines ; des modifications : des récepteurs CB1 des endocannabinoïdes ; des récepteurs de l’acide glutamique ; du GABA ; de protéines impliquées dans la plasticité synaptique, etc. Des modifications épigénétiques peuvent aussi affecter : le système immunitaire ; les activités cognitives ; le développement d’affections psychiatriques en relation avec des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale. Les connaissances qui s’accumulent à cet égard vont à l’opposé de la banalisation ambiante du cannabis. Elles imposent d’alerter les pouvoirs publics et le public, spécialement les jeunes, sur les risques associées à la consommation de cette drogue. Summary The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication. In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle. These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ... These changes can also affect: immune system, cognitive activities, development of psychiatric diseases, related to disturbances of brain maturation. The knowledge that accumulates in this respect is the opposite of the ambient trivialization of this drug. They impose sending an alert to the public authorities and to the public, especially young people, warning on the risks associated with this drug use and abuse.","Costentin, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.004,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
659,Conduites addictives: faits cliniques*,"Résumé Malgré les fréquentes comorbidités psychiatriques, le trouble de l’usage de substance doit être appréhendé comme une pathologie autonome par ses déterminants, sa sémiologie et ses modalités évolutives spontanées ou sous traitement. De multiples produits de synthèse sont désormais accessibles via internet : associé à la créativité des chimistes cela a participé à l'émergence de pratiques inédites allant du chemsex au purple drank. Les conduites addictives résultent d’un ensemble de facteurs individuels (vulnérabilités biologique et psychique) et contextuels (disponibilité et banalisation du toxique dans l’environnement). Les pathologies mentales autres sont des facteurs de vulnérabilité à la pathologie addictive, tout comme les conduites addictives peuvent révéler une pathologie émotionnelle ou psychotique. Le médecin se doit d’entendre l’impuissance du malade face au besoin irrépressible de consommer (craving) et proposer une thérapeutique qui peut être chimique (y compris traitement de substitution) et psychologique. Dans la majorité des cas un accompagnement social s’impose pour corriger les effets désocialisants du trouble de l’usage de substances ou des comportements addictifs. Abstract Despite the frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorder must be understood as an autonomous pathology due to its own determinants, semiology and possibilities of evolution, either spontaneous or under treatment. The ease of access to multiple synthetic products via the Internet combined with the creativity of chemists are contributing to the emergence of novel practices ranging from chemsex to purple drank. Addictive behaviours result from a combination of individual factors (biological and psychological vulnerability) and contextual factors (availability and triviality of the toxicant in the environment). Other mental disorders are factors of vulnerability to addictive pathology as well as the addictive behaviours can reveal an emotional or psychotic pathology. The physician needs to hear the patient powerlessness hidden behind the craving and propose a therapy that may be chemical (including substitution treatment) and psychological. Most of the time, social support is necessary to correct the desocializing effects of substance use disorder or addictive behaviours.","Lucet, C.; Olié, J.P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.005,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
660,Développement professionnel continu (DPC) et émergence de la recertification en France. Évolution législative et commentaires,"Résumé La formation médicale continue (FMC) est une obligation déontologique et légale en France. L’évaluation des pratiques professionnelles (EPP) a rejoint en 2004 l’obligation d’acquisition des connaissances pour devenir le développement professionnel continu (DPC) en 2009. Actuellement, le dispositif est complet : définition, organisation et validation. Mais l’obligation individuelle pour valider le DPC n’a jamais été appliquée. La recertification prévue par la loi de 2019 ne sera opérationnelle qu’en 2021, au plus tôt. Son pilier essentiel est le DPC. La mission de recertification qui a préparé la loi exclue toutes épreuves de vérification des connaissances. La recertification se fait par une valorisation du parcours professionnel comprenant, outre le DPC, une activité maintenue et régulière, une amélioration de la relation avec le patient, la prise en compte de la santé du médecin et l’absence d’évènements indésirables. L’ordre veillant sur la compétence des médecins, c’est lui qui reçoit la validation du DPC, comme il recevra celle de la recertification. Summary Continuing medical education (CME) is an obligation in France. The evaluation of professional practices joined in 2004 the obligation to acquire knowledge, becoming the Continuing professional development (CPD) in 2009. Currently, the system is complete: definition, organization and validation. However, the individual obligation to validate the CPD has never been applied. The recertification process provided for by the 2019 law will not be operational until 2021, at the earliest. Its essential pillar is CPD. The recertification mission who prepared the law excludes all knowledge verification tests. Recertification is done by promoting the professional career path including, in addition to CPD, a maintained and regular activity, an improvement in the relationship with the patient, taking into account the doctor's health and the absence of undesirable events. Seeing that the French Medical Council oversees the professional skills of physicians, it is the Council that receives the validation of the CPD and will receive that of recertification.","Bertrand, D.; Bouet, P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.006,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

663,Uvéites et tatouages,"Résumé Les complications des tatouages sont multiples et connues depuis de nombreuses années. Cependant, leur succès explique leur multiplication exponentielle dans tous les pays. Cela a permis de confirmer l’apparition de deux nouvelles complications : une réaction de type sarcoïdose cutanée, localisée ou à distance, ainsi que l’apparition d’uvéites cliniques et histologiques. Ceci dans le cadre d’une réaction d’hypersensibilité retardée, et/ou bien d’une réaction granulomateuse. Leur prévention reste assez mal connue. Elle impose de réaliser chez chaque sujet porteur d’un tatouage un bilan de sarcoïdose systémique ainsi qu’une enquête ophtalmologique à la recherche d’une éventuelle uvéite. Si elle se confirme, seront aussitôt réalisés en urgence des mesures préventives et thérapeutiques afin d’éviter une cécité. Ces nouvelles complications confirment l’extrême gravité de l’utilisation d’encres non contrôlées, véritables mélanges toxiques et sensibilisants, notablement lors de tatouages colorés étendus. Ces encres colorées particulièrement agressives libèrent dans l’organisme de multiples substances et nanoparticules dont on ne mesure pas toutes les conséquences néfastes, à moyen et long terme. Summary The complications of tattoos are multiple and known for many years. However, their success explains their exponential multiplication in all countries. This confirmed the development of two new complications: a localized or remote skin sarcoidosis reaction, as well as the development of clinical and histological uveitis. This is in the context of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, or a granulomatous reaction. Their prevention remains rather poorly known. It requires that each tattoo-carrying subject perform a systemic sarcoidosis check-up as well as an ophthalmological investigation in search of possible uveitis. If confirmed, preventive and therapeutic measures will be carried out in emergencies to avoid blindness. These new complications confirm the extreme severity of the use of uncontrolled inks, real toxic and sensitizing mixtures, especially apparently during extensive colorful tattoos. These particularly aggressive colored inks release multiple substances and nanoparticles into the body, not all of which are measured in the medium and long term.","Bazex, J.; Arné, J.-L.; Lambert, D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.009,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
664,Tatouage et réaction sarcoïdosique*,"RÉSUMÉ La pratique du tatouage se développe de plus en plus dans le monde entier. Les infections sont connues, mais les réactions inflammatoires chroniques ont souvent donné lieu à des manifestations cliniques variées. À côté des réactions allergiques, les réactions non allergiques prévalent dans les tatouages noirs et se manifestent sous la forme de lésions « papulonodulaires ». L'importance de la biopsie des lésions papulo-nodulaires pour confirmer le diagnostic doit être soulignée. Les nanoparticules de noir de carbone s'agglomèrent dans le derme avec le temps pour former des granulomes sarcoïdosiques. Granulome à corps étranger lié au pigment et sarcoïdose sont souvent difficiles à distinguer. La couleur noire semble la plus fréquente. D’autres étiologies que le pigment sont évoquées, tel que le rôle d’un agent infectieux, mais à ce jour aucun n’a été identifié, un terrain génétique particuliers, qu’il reste à définir. Des localisations systémiques étant possible, le bilan d’extension est important à réaliser. Le traitement est le même que la sarcoïdose classique. Certains médicaments favoriseraient le développement d’une sarcoïdose sur tatouage. Ils doivent donc être recherchés systématiquement. Il est aussi important à titre préventif, que les sujets et leur médecin traitant soient informés de ce risque potentiel lié à ces médicaments indiqués dans des pathologies graves spécifiques. SUMMARY The practice of tattoo is developing more and more all over the world. Infections are known. but chronic inflammatory reactions have often resulted in a variety of clinical manifestations. In addition to allergic reactions, non-allergic reactions prevail in black tattoos and manifest themselves as ""papulonodular"" lesions. The importance of biopsy of papulonodular lesions to confirm the diagnosis should be emphasized. Carbon black nanoparticles agglomerate in the dermis over time to form sarcoid granulomas. Pigment-bound foreign-body granuloma and sarcoidosis are often difficult to distinguish. The black color seems to be the most common. Other aetiologias than pigment are evoked, such as the role of an infectious agent, but to date none has been identified, a particular genetic terrain remains to be defined. Systemic localizations being possible, the extension assessment is important to carry out. It is also important, as a preventive measure, that subjects and their treating physician be informed of the potential risk associated with these drugs indicated for specific serious pathologies.","Dréno, Brigitte",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.011,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
665,Pour une prise en charge préventive de la maladie d’Alzheimer,"Résumé Les démences et la maladie d’Alzheimer (MA), en particulier, vont devenir de plus en plus un enjeu de santé publique. Trois données importantes peuvent cependant modifier le poids de ces pathologies : (1) de simples mesures d’hygiène de vie (contrôle de facteurs de risque vasculaire, activité physique et stimulation cognitive) instaurées chez les jeunes adultes ont un impact sur un déclin cognitif ultérieur ; (2) chez des sujets âgés à risque, ces mêmes dispositions retardent l’entrée dans la maladie et (3) enfin et pour la première fois, un anticorps anti-amyloïde aurait montré un effet significatif sur l’évolution de la MA chez des patients au stade débutant. Il ressort de ces travaux qu’il faut se préparer à reconsidérer la stratégie de prise en charge des troubles cognitifs, qu’ils soient mineurs ou majeurs, et de la MA en particulier. L’entrée des patients dans le parcours de soins reste aujourd’hui trop tardive. La solution est d’agir plus précocement, voire de façon préventive. Il faut développer une offre de soins adaptée à cette situation nouvelle afin d’agir sur la maladie le plus tôt possible, fondée sur : des algorithmes prédictifs pour déterminer chez les sujets sans symptômes spécifiques ceux qui seront à risque de développer une pathologie dégénérative. Ces algorithmes devront être mis au point à partir de données démographiques, familiales, cognitives, génomiques et biologiques, comme celles recueillies dans le projet « Santé-Cerveau » développé en partenariat avec l’ARS et les médecins généralistes ; le renforcement des activités de prévention dans les 450 centres mémoire de proximité disponibles en France et les 26 CM2R et la transformation de quelques-uns de ces centres experts en cliniques de prévention de la démence pour tester les mesures de prévention, initier des programmes d’éducation thérapeutique multidomaine et les valider, communiquer sur le risque, répondre à la demande de sujets inquiets et déterminer, chez ceux-ci, à l’aide des algorithmes, le niveau de risque qu’ils ont de déclarer une MA dans les mois et années qui viennent, en tenant compte de la compétition entre les risques. On peut ainsi se préparer à faire bénéficier précocement les uns et les autres des traitements pharmacologiques susceptibles d’exister. Summary Dementias, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular, will increasingly become a public health issue. However, three major data may change the severity of these pathologies: in young adults, simple measures of healthy lifestyle (control of vascular risk factors, physical activity and cognitive stimulation), have an impact on a future cognitive decline; the same lifestyle interventions may delay the start of the disease for elderly people potentially at-risk; finally, and for the first time, a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid lesions has just shown a significant effect on the progression of AD in patients at an early stage of the disease. According to these results, we will have to reconsider the strategy for managing minor or severe cognitive disorders and particularly AD. Nowadays, patients start the care process too late. The solution is to act earlier, even preventively. It is necessary to improve a care offer adapted to this new situation in order to impact on the disease as soon as possible, even before the onset of symptoms, based on: predictive algorithms aimed at establishing whose cognitively unimpaired individuals may further develop the disease. These algorithms will be based on demographic, family, cognitive, genomic and biological data, such as in the “Santé Cerveau” project developed in partnership with the Health Regional Agency (ARS) and the general practitioners and some expert centers must become “dementia prevention clinics” to test prevention measures, initiate and validate multi-domain therapeutic education programs, to disclose about the risk in response to the request of worried patients, and to propose early pharmacological treatments if these individuals are on the way to declare AD in the coming months, taking into account competition between risks. This will allow to prepare to make use of new pharmacological treatments that might be discovered.","Dubois, B.; Bombois, S.; Villain, N.; Teichmann, M.; Epelbaum, S.; Migliaccio, R.; Genthon, R.; Verrat, B.; Lesoil, C.; Levy, M.; Le Ber, I.; Levy, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.012,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

667,Conséquences anormales des accidents médicaux non fautifs : Jurisprudence du Conseil d’État,"Résumé L’indemnisation des accidents médicaux sans faute des professionnels ou des établissements est prévue par l’article L.1142-1 du code de la santé publique créé par la loi du 4 mars 2002 relative aux droits des malades et à la qualité du système de santé. Il indique les conditions d’imputabilité, de critères cliniques et de gravité. Parmi les critères cliniques « un accident médical (…) ouvre droit à la réparation des préjudices (…) au titre de la solidarité nationale, lorsqu’ils (…) qu’ils ont eu pour le patient des conséquences anormales au regard de son état de santé comme de l’évolution prévisible de celui-ci (…) ». Les ordres juridictionnels ont eu à caractériser cette « anormalité des conséquences ». Selon la jurisprudence du Conseil d’État du 12 décembre 2014 la condition d’anormalité est toujours « remplie lorsque l'acte médical a entraîné des conséquences notablement plus graves que celles auxquelles le patient était exposé de manière suffisamment probable en l’absence de traitement » et si tel n’est pas le cas, « elles ne peuvent être regardées comme anormales sauf si, dans les conditions où l’acte a été accompli, la survenance du dommage présentait une probabilité faible ; qu’ainsi, elles ne peuvent être regardées comme anormales au regard de l’état du patient lorsque la gravité de cet état a conduit à pratiquer un acte comportant des risques élevés dont la réalisation est à l’origine du dommage ». Le Conseil d’Etat a précisé, en 2019 qu’une probabilité de survenance de 3 % était une probabilité faible. Summary Compensation for no-fault medical accidents to professionals or establishments is provided for by article L.1142-1 of the public health code, created by the law of March 4, 2002 relating to the rights of patients and the quality of the health system. It indicates the conditions of accountability, clinical criteria and severity. Among the clinical criteria ""a medical accident (...) gives the right to compensation for damages (...) in the name of national solidarity, when (...) they have had abnormal consequences for the patient in view of his condition as well as the foreseeable evolution of it (…)”. The jurisdictional orders have had to characterize this ""abnormality of the consequences"". According to the jurisprudence of the Conseil d’Etat of December 12, 2014 the condition of abnormality is always ""satisfied when the medical act entailed consequences significantly more serious than those to which the patient was exposed in a sufficiently probable way in the absence of treatment "". And if this is not the case,"" they cannot be regarded as abnormal unless, under the conditions in which the act was performed, the occurrence of damage presented a low probability; that thus, they cannot be regarded as abnormal with regard to the state of the patient when the gravity of this state led to practicing an act involving high risks whose realization is at the origin of the damage "".

669,Confidence in managing human monkeypox cases in Asia: A cross-sectional survey among general practitioners in Indonesia,"Abstract The current re-emergence of human monkeypox (HMPX) is a global concern for endemic and non-endemic countries, but healthcare workers in some regions, like Asia, have less experience with identifying and treating HMPX cases. This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p < 0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","Harapan, Harapan; Setiawan, Abdul M.; Yufika, Amanda; Anwar, Samsul; Wahyuni, Sri; Asrizal, Febrivan W.; Sufri, Muhammad R.; Putra, Reza P.; Wijayanti, Nanda P.; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Maulana, Razi; Khusna, Afriyani; Nusrina, Ina; Shidiq, Muhammad; Fitriani, Devi; Muharrir, Muharrir; Husna, Cut A.; Yusri, Fitria; Maulana, Reza; Utomo, Prattama S.; Andalas, Mohd; Wagner, Abram L.; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,Elsevier,10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
670,"Virulence, antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic analysis of zoonotic walking pneumonia Mycoplasma arginini in the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius)","Abstract In the scientific literature, a small amount of information is found concerning mycoplasmosis in camel species. A variety of pathogens could be causative agents for pneumonia, but walking pneumonia is mostly caused by Mycoplasma with slow development and mild symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius) and extending the arsenal of factors implicated in pathogenicity of M. arginini to shed light on the current knowledge gap. 460 lung samples (pneumonic; n=210 and apparently healthy; n=250) were randomly collected from the one-humped camels (C. domedarius) that have been imported from Sudan and slaughtered at Cairo Slaughterhouse. 48 out of 210 isolates (22.9%) recovered from the pneumonic lungs were recorded as M. arginini. Positive PCR results were obtained for all 48 isolates. On the other hand, infection with the organism was not detected in the apparently healthy lungs. Hemolysis and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) production, a compound that has previously not been identified as a virulence factor in M. arginini, was evident in 100% of the isolates. The 48 M. arginini isolates were weak in their ability to form biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. All isolates were 100% susceptible to florfenicol and streptomycin and 100% resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to lincomycin, spiromycin, tylosin, doxacyclin and erythromycin was observed at different frequencies. 13 different combinations of antibiotics representing one to four classes were evident with the Macrolide erythromycin being the most represented. It also should be noted that the ciprofloxacin, doxacyclin, lincomycin, erythromycin combination was the most noted in 21/48 isolates. Surprisingly, none of the virulence genes (vsp, uvrC and gapA) and quinolone resistance genes (parC and gyrA) were detected by PCR.","Abdelazeem, Walaa Mohammed; Zolnikov, Tara Rava; Mohammed, Zeinab Roshdy; Saad, Alaa; Osman, Kamelia M",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105500,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105500,Elsevier,10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105500,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

683,Respiratory Muscle Performance Screening for Infectious Disease Management Following COVID-19: A Highly Pressurized Situation,"Abstract The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic elucidated how a single highly infectious virus can overburden healthcare systems of even highly economically developed nations. A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit (intensive care unit) beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. While impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare, it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health, in particular obesity. However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this perspective paper is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervene if identified with the goal of unburdening healthcare systems during future pandemic crises. • Poor baseline health increases the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus infection and poorer outcomes. • Patients with poorer baseline health, notably obesity, are more likely to demonstrate impaired respiratory muscle performance, and poorer outcomes following intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. • This relationship indicates respiratory muscle performance may contribute to outcomes related to acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus infection in patients with poor baseline health.","Severin, Richard; Arena, Ross; Lavie, Carl J; Bond, Samantha; Phillips, Shane A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.04.003,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
684,Inpatient Care of Patients with COVID-19: A Guide for Hospitalists,"Abstract Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has quickly caused a pandemic. This virus causes a disease now known as coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. As an increasing proportion of the at-risk population becomes infected, and patients with severe illness are hospitalized, it is essential for hospitalists to remain current on how to best care for people with suspected or confirmed disease. Establishing a system for logistical planning, and accurate information sharing is strongly recommended. Infection control remains the ultimate goal. As such, healthcare workers should be educated on universal and isolation precautions, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Social distancing should be encouraged to prevent the spread of infection, and creative and innovative ways to reduce contact may need to be considered. Moreover, it is imperative to prepare for contingencies as medical staff will inevitably get sick or become unavailable. Hospitalists have the difficult task of caring for patients, while also adapting to the many logistical and social elements of a pandemic.","Yetmar, Zachary A.; Issa, Meltiady; Munawar, Sadia; Burton, M.

685,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy,"Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 – 2.5, indicating that 2 – 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.","Dashraath, Pradip; Jing Lin Jeslyn, Wong; Mei Xian Karen, Lim; Li Min, Lim; Sarah, Li; Biswas, Arijit; Arjandas Choolani, Mahesh; Mattar, Citra; Lin, Su Lin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

Data sources we searched electronically Pubmed, Cinahl, Scopus using combination of keywords “Coronavirus and/ or pregnancy”; “COVID and/or pregnancy”; “COVID disease and/or pregnancy”; “COVID pneumonia and/or pregnancy. There were no restriction of languages in order to collect as much cases as possible.

Study appraisal and synthesis methods all the studies included have been evaluated according the tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case series described by Murad et al. Results 6 studies including 51 women were eligible for the systematic review. Three pregnancies were ongoing at the time of the report; of the remaining 48, 46 were delivered with a cesarean section and 2 vaginally; there was 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal death. Conclusions although vertical transmission of SARS-Cov2 has been excluded thus far and the outcome for mothers and fetuses has been generally good, the high rate of preterm cesarean delivery is a reason for concern. These interventions were typically elective, and it is reasonable to question whether they were warranted or not.

Data on the effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. Objectives To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study Desigh Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20 and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Results The median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (IQR 36+0-39+1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. There were eight cases (6.9%, 8/116) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of eight patients (1/8) that presented in the first- and early-second-trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Twenty-one of 99 patients (21.2%, 21/99) that had delivered had preterm birth, including six with preterm premature ruptured of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks was 6.1% (6/99). There was one case of severe neonatal asphyxia that resulted in neonatal death. Eighty-six of the 100 neonates that had testing for SARS-CoV-2 had negative results, of these ten neonates had paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples that were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the infection manifests during the third-trimester of pregnancy.","Yan, Jie; Guo, Juanjuan; Fan, Cuifang; Juan, Juan; Yu, Xuechen; Li, Jiafu; Feng, Ling; Li, Chunyan; Chen, Huijun; Qiao, Yuan; Lei, Di; Wang, Chen; Xiong, Guoping; Xiao, Fengyi; He, Wencong; Pang, Qiumei; Hu, Xiaoling; Wang, Suqing; Chen, Dunjin; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Poon, Liona C.; Yang, Huixia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.014,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

691,Maternal Death Due to COVID-19 Disease,"Abstract Background Despite 2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (current as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity had been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease. Given the disproportionate burden of severe and mortal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other related coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected. Objectives To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease. Study design We describe here a multi-institution adjudicated case series from Iran which includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease during their latter 2nd or 3rd trimester. All 9 pregnant women were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR nucleic acid testing (NAT). Outcomes of these women were compared to their familial/household members with exposure to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease. Results Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator-dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance the maternal outcomes were more severe when compared to other high and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison). Conclusion We report herein maternal deaths due to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerges, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease in their latter trimester(s).","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A.; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Seferovic, Maxim D.; Aski, Soudabeh Kazemi; Arian, Sara E.; Pooransari, Parichehr; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Aalipour, Soroush; Soleimani, Zahra; Naemi, Mahsa; Molaei, Behnaz; Ahangari, Roghaye; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Oskoei, Atousa Dabiri; Pirozan, Parisa; Darkhaneh, Roya Faraji; Laki, Mahboobeh Gharib; Farani, Ali Karimi; Atrak, Shahla; Miri, Mir Mohammad; Kouchek, Mehran; Shojaei, Seyedpouzhia; Hadavand, Fahimeh; Keikha, Fatemeh; Hosseini, Maryam Sadat; Borna, Sedigheh; Ariana, Shideh; Shariat, Mamak; Fatemi, Alireza; Nouri, Behnaz; Nekooghadam, Seyed Mojtaba; Aagaard, Kjersti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.030,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

695,Surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comprehensive overview and perioperative care,"Abstract COVID-19 disease is a pandemic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronavirus family known as 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly contagious and transmitted mainly by droplets or close contact. As the global incidence of COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, health systems worldwide started to suffer in terms of its capability to manage affected people and the ability to provide standard treatment for critically ill patients in a safe environment. As Medical staff has extensive contact with patients, families as well as other health care providers, they are very likely to cause cross-infection. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 disease as well as to highlight essential measures that healthcare providers and surgeons need to take into consideration during their management of the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Balas, Mahmoud; Al-Balas, Hasan Ibrahim; Al-Balas, Hamzeh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.04.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.04.018,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

699,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection,"Abstract With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","Alexandre, J; Cracowski, JL; Richard, V; Bouhanick, B",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

711,BEDSIDE TRANSCERVICAL-TRANSTRACHEAL POST-INTUBATION INJURY REPAIR IN A COVID-19 PATIENT,"Abstract SARS-Co-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide since December 2019. A relevant rate of patients develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome that require hospitalization. Among them, a non-negligible rate (9.8%-15.2%) requires tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation. We report the case of a COVID-19 patient developing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema secondary to post-intubation tracheal injury. The management of COVID-19 patient can be challenging due to the risk of disease transmission to caregivers and epidemic spread. We performed a bedside tracheal injury surgical repair, after failure of conservative management, with resolution of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and improvement of patient’s conditions.","Bassi, Massimiliano; Anile, Marco; Pecoraro, Ylenia; Ruberto, Franco; Martelli, Sabina; Piazzolla, Mario; Pugliese, Francesco; Venuta, Federico; De Giacomo, Tiziano",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.009,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
712,Novel Percutaneous Tracheostomy for Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Background COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic, with many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a super-spreading event due to aerosolization that unduly risks healthcare workers. Methods Patients with severe COVID-19 that were on mechanical ventilation ≥ 5 days were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. This improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. Results From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus of which 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 days (SD ±5 days). Currently, thirty-two (33%) patients do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) patients remain on full ventilator support, while 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven (7%) died as result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers have developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions Our percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for healthcare workers.","Angel, Luis; Kon, Zachary N.; Chang, Stephanie H.; Rafeq, Samaan; Shekar, Saketh Palasamudram; Mitzman, Brian; Amoroso, Nancy; Goldenberg, Ronald; Sureau, Kimberly; Smith, Deane; Cerfolio, Robert J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.010,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
713,MANAGEMENT OF PERSISTENT PNEUMOTHORAX WITH THORACOSCOPY AND BLEBS RESECTION IN COVID-19 PATIENTS,"Abstract Several studies have been published describing the clinical and radiographic findings on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Therefore, there is currently a lack of pathologic data about its effects in intubated patients. Pneumothorax may occur rarely and results from a combination of fibrotic parenchyma with prolonged high-pressure ventilation. Chest drain represent the first line treatment. However, in case of persistent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy and bleb resection may be a feasible option to reduce air leak and improve ventilation. We report the cases of two COVID-19 patients successfully treated with thoracoscopy, bleb resection, and pleurectomy for persistent pneumothorax.","Aiolfi, Alberto; Biraghi, Tullio; Montisci, Andrea; Bonitta, Gianluca; Micheletto, Giancarlo; Donatelli, Francesco; Cirri, Silvia; Bona, Davide",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.011,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

The pneumonia might evolve in ARDS requiring assisted mechanical-ventilation. The prolonged immobilization combined with respiratory failure, sepsis and dehydration might expose SARS-CoV-2/patients to increased risk of complication including pulmonary embolism. We report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 complicated by massive pulmonary embolism underwent successfully surgical embolectomy.

716,Membrane transport proteins in melanosomes: Regulation of ions for pigmentation,"Abstract Melanosomes are unique organelles in melanocytes that produce melanin, the pigment for skin, hair, and eye color. Tyrosinase is the essential and rate-limiting enzyme for melanin production, that strictly requires neutral pH for activity. pH maintenance is a result of the combinational function of multiple ion transport proteins. Thus, ion homeostasis in melanosomes is crucial for melanin synthesis. Defect of the ion transport system causes various pigmentation phenotypes, from mild effect to severe disorders such as albinism. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge of the ion transport system, such as transport function, structure, and the physiological roles and mechanisms of the ion transport proteins in melanosomes. In addition, we propose a model of melanosomal ion transport system—how the functional coupling of multiple transport proteins modulates and maintains ion homeostasis. We discuss melanin synthesis in terms of the ion transport system.","Wiriyasermkul, Pattama; Moriyama, Satomi; Nagamori, Shushi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2020.183318,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2020.183318,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbamem.2020.183318,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
717,Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses,"Abstract The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19
718,Spike protein recognition of mammalian ACE2 predicts the host range and an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 causes the recent global COVID-19 public health emergency. ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To predict the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the key residues of ACE2 for recognizing S protein. We found that most of the selected mammals including pets (dog and cat), pangolin and Circetidae mammals remained the most of key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interface between cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S protein was simulated through homology modeling. We identified that N82 in ACE2 showed a closer contact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than M82 in human ACE2. Our finding will provide important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and a new strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Luan, Junwen; Lu, Yue; Jin, Xiaolu; Zhang, Leiliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19
719,A possible strategy to fight COVID-19: Interfering with spike glycoprotein trimerization,"Abstract The recent release of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein allows detailed analysis of the structural features that are required for stabilizing the infective form of its quaternary assembly. Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle. The approach we propose here can be an additional strategy to fight against the deadly virus. Ligands of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein that we have predicted in the present computational investigation, might be the basis for new experimental studies in vitro and in vivo.","Bongini, Pietro; Trezza, Alfonso; Bianchini, Monica; Spiga, Ottavia; Niccolai, Neri",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.007,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09
720,EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 inhibits ACE2 expression,"Abstract The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading globally and quickly, leading to emerging health issues. SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues.

The results illustrated that roscovitine inhibited multiple subtypes of influenza strains dose-dependently, including A/WSN/1933(H1N1), A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) and A/FM1/47 (H1N1) with IC50 value of 3.35 ± 0.39, 7.01 ± 1.84 and 5.99 ± 1.89 μM, respectively. Moreover, roscovitine suppressed the gene transcription and genome replication steps in the viral life cycle. Further mechanistic studies indicated that roscovitine reduced viral polymerase activity and bound specifically to the viral PB2cap protein by fluorescence polarization assay (FP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Therefore, we believed roscovitine, as a PB2cap inhibitor, was a prospective antiviral agent to be developed as therapeutic treatment against influenza A virus infection.","Huang, Qi; Zhong, Yingyuan; Li, Jingyan; Ye, Yilu; Wu, Wenjiao; Chen, Lizhu; Feng, Mingkai; Yang, Jie; Liu, Shuwen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.034,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.034,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
722,The seafood Musculus senhousei shows anti-influenza A virus activity by targeting virion envelope lipids,"Abstract Marine environments are known to be a new source of structurally diverse bioactive molecules. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of Pyropheophorbide a (PPa) from the mussel Musculus senhousei (M. senhousei) that showed broad anti-influenza A virus activity in vitro against a panel of influenza A viral strains. The analysis of the mechanism of action indicated that PPa functions in the early stage of virus infection by interacting with the lipid bilayer of the virion, resulting in an alteration of membrane-associated functions, thereby blocking the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the anti-influenza A virus activity of PPa was further assessed in mice infected with the influenza A virus. The survival rate and mean survival time of mice were apparently prolonged compared with the control group which was not treated with the drug. Therefore, PPa and its derivatives may represent lead compounds for controlling influenza A virus infection.","Chen, Daiwei; Lu, Shengsheng; Yang, Guang; Pan, Xiaoyan; Fan, Sheng; Xie, Xi; Chen, Qi; Li, Fangfang; Li, Zhonghuang; Wu, Shaohua; He, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113982,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113982,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bcp.2020.113982,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7–99.4]; P<0.01). Conclusions Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections. Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.","Zhong, Qi; Liu, Yin Y.; Luo, Qiong; Zou, Yu F.; Jiang, Hai X.; Li, Hui; Zhang, Jing J.; Li, Zhen; Yang, Xin; Ma, Min; Tang, Li J.; Chen, Ying Y.; Zheng, Feng; Ke, Jian J.; Zhang, Zong Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28

732,Anaesthesia and COVID-19: infection control,"Summary The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.","Odor, Peter M.; Neun, Maximilian; Bampoe, Sohail; Clark, Sam; Heaton, Daniel; Hoogenboom, Emilie M.; Brown, Michael; Patel, Anil; Kamming, Damon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

734,"Emergency tracheal intubation in 202 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: lessons learnt and international expert recommendations","Summary Tracheal intubation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients creates a risk to physiologically compromised patients and to attending healthcare providers. Clinical information on airway management and expert recommendations in these patients are urgently needed. By analysing a two-centre retrospective observational case series from Wuhan, China, a panel of international airway management experts discussed the results and formulated consensus recommendations for the management of tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Of 202 COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency tracheal intubation, most were males (n=136; 67.3%) and aged 65 yr or more (n=128; 63.4%). Most patients (n=152; 75.2%) were hypoxaemic (Sao 2 <90%) before intubation. Personal protective equipment was worn by all intubating healthcare workers. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) or modified RSI was used with an intubation success rate of 89.1% on the first attempt and 100% overall. Hypoxaemia (Sao 2 <90%) was common during intubation (n=148; 73.3%). Hypotension (arterial pressure <90/60 mm Hg) occurred in 36 (17.8%) patients during and 45 (22.3%) after intubation with cardiac arrest in four (2.0%). Pneumothorax occurred in 12 (5.9%) patients and death within 24 h in 21 (10.4%). Up to 14 days post-procedure, there was no evidence of cross infection in the anaesthesiologists who intubated the COVID-19 patients. Based on clinical information and expert recommendation, we propose detailed planning, strategy, and methods for tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.","Yao, Wenlong; Wang, Tingting; Jiang, Bailing; Gao, Feng; Wang, Li; Zheng, Hongbo; Xiao, Weimin; Xu, Li; Yao, Shanglong; Mei, Wei; Chen, Xiangdong; Luo, Ailin; Sun, Liang; Cook, Tim; Behringer, Elizabeth; Huitink, Johannes M.; Wong, David T.; Lane-Fall, Meghan; McNarry, Alistair; McGuire, Barry; Higgs, Andrew; Shah, Amit; Patel, Anil; Zuo, Mingzhang; Ma, Wuhua; Xue, Zhanggang; Zhang, Li-Ming; Li, Wenxian; Wang, Yong; Hagberg, Carin; O’Sullivan, Ellen; Fleisher, Lee A.; Wei, Huafeng; Peng, Zhiyong; Liang, Hansheng; Nishikawa, Koji",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.026,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

Après la région de Wuhan, Hubei en Chine, premier cluster de ce virus, les pays européens, dont la France, sont actuellement les pays avec le plus de nouveaux cas de patients contaminés. Cette épidémie bouleverse l’organisation du corps médical et paramédical, notamment la prise en charge des patients de cancérologie, infectés ou non par le virus, tant elle mobilise de moyens de santé et nécessite en urgence une modification des pratiques médicales. Abstract À new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of the first pandemic in the 21st century. The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID19) first occurred in Wuhan, Hubei in China. European countries, and France, are now the main cluster, with thousands of new cases of COVID-19 patients. This epidemic requires such health care resources and an urgent modification of our medical procedures that it is about to upset profoundly the entire medical organization. In particular, the epidemic changes totally the management of patients in oncology, be they infected or not. We report hereby the testimonies of residents in oncology regarding modifications in health and patient care and the different organizations that are implemented in France, in two clusters of the infection, to cope with the virus. Residents, who are given higher autonomy, are especially concerned with the short- and long-term consequences of the situation for their patients.","Delaye, Matthieu; Naoun, Natacha; Mailly-Giacchetti, Léah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.04.002,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
764,Are your cash-flow tools recession ready?,"Abstract In good times like those most businesses have enjoyed for the past decade, business owners have typically watched their income statements with pleasure, as year-to-year performance gains have fattened their dividend payouts and increased the valuation of the companies they own and run. All too often in such times, scant attention is paid to what’s between the top line and the bottom line of the income statement. Worse, most business owners, in my experience, give little more than a cursory nod to the balance sheet. Why does this matter? When a recession lands on their doorstep with a sudden thud, as it apparently just has, many of these same people will find themselves having sailed too close to the wind, with cash running out and a dearth of tools to help them weather the storm and understand what has gone wrong. But it need not be so, for there are four simple tools to help any business owner answer these four important questions: (1) Where is cash going in my business, and where is it coming from? (2) To what extent are my profit margins improving or declining, and why? (3) To what extent am I effectively managing the cash-flow relationships with my customers and my suppliers? (4) What, if anything, can I do to better manage the cash that flows into and out of my business? If your business is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic, here are some tools to help it survive.","Mullins, John",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bushor.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bushor.2020.04.003,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

The patient's primary symptom was a red eye with watery discharge, though she did have mild respiratory symptoms, without fever. She was diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis; evolving corneal findings were characterized through repeat visits to ophthalmology. A conjunctival swab of the affected eye was positive for the SAR-CoV-2 virus. This case emphasizes the importance of ensuring that first-line health care providers, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, emergency physicians, and family physicians, consider COVID-19 on the differential for any patient with recent travel who presents with acute conjunctivitis. Having a high index of suspicion with this presentation would allow for appropriate precautions to be taken to prevent further spread of COVID-19.","Cheema, Marvi; Aghazadeh, Helya; Nazarali, Samir; Ting, Andrew; Hodges, Jennifer; McFarlane, Alexandra; Kanji, Jamil N.; Zelyas, Nathan; Damji, Karim F.; Solarte, Carlos",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjo.2020.03.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcjo.2020.03.003,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

768,Protective immunity after COVID-19 has been questioned: what can we do without SARS-CoV-2-IgG detection?,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome that is called COVID-19. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include diarrhea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Immunology is part of the process of clinical evolution, but there are some questions around immunity-based protection: (1) why some infected people have only mild symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic; (2) why delayed and weak antibody responses are associated with severe outcomes; and (3) why positivity in molecular tests does not represent protective antibody IgG. Perhaps T cell responses may be the key to solving those questions. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells persist in peripheral blood and may be capable of providing effective information about protective immunity. The T cells studies can be helpful in elucidating the pathways for development of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostics for COVID-19 and for filling these immunology knowledge gaps.","Gil Melgaço, Juliana; Azamor, Tamiris; Paula Dinis Ano Bom, Ana",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104114,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104114,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cellimm.2020.104114,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

Based on the X-ray structure (PDB code: 6LU7), ligands were generated using a multimodal structure-based design and then docked to the monomer in the active state. Docking calculations show that ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases. The most potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement.","Macchiagodena, Marina; Pagliai, Marco; Procacci, Piero",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2020.137489,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2020.137489,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cplett.2020.137489,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

Abstract Introduction: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. Material and method: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale (BRCSS), the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p <0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases. Local resumption of surgical activity must be based on the prioritisation of the cases to be operated on, respecting certain premises of security and optimisation of the available resources.","Martino, Marcello Di; Septiem, Javier García; González, Rocío Maqueda; de Nova, Jose Luis Muñoz; de la Hoz Rodríguez, Ángela; Bonito, Alba Correa; Martín-Pérez, Elena",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.029,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

RECOMENDACIONES DE LA ASOCIACIÓN ESPAÑOLA DE CIRUJANOS,"RESUMEN La infección por el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 -covid-19-) ha determinado la necesidad de la reorganización de muchos centros hospitalarios en el mundo. España, como uno de los epicentros de la enfermedad, ha debido asumir cambios en la práctica totalidad de su territorio. Sin embargo, y desde el inicio de la pandemia, en todos los centros que atienden urgencias quirúrgicas ha sido necesario el mantenimiento de su cobertura, aunque igualmente ha sido inevitable introducir directrices especiales de ajuste al nuevo escenario que permitan el mantenimiento de la excelencia en la calidad asistencial. Este documento desarrolla una serie de indicaciones generales para la cirugía de urgencias y la atención al politraumatizado, desarrolladas desde la literatura disponible y consensuadas por un subgrupo de profesionales desde el grupo general Cirugía-AEC-COVID19. Estas medidas van encaminadas a contemplar un riguroso control de la exposición en pacientes y profesionales, a tener en cuenta las implicaciones de la pandemia sobre diferentes escenarios perioperatorios relacionados con la urgencia y a una adaptación ajustada a la situación del centro en relación con la atención a pacientes infectados.

784,Thrombocytopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD −31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from −35 to −29 × 109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, −48 × 109/L; 95% CI, −57 to −39 × 109/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8–14.6). Conclusions Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Henry, Brandon Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.","Lv, Ding-feng; Ying, Qi-ming; Weng, Yue-song; Shen, Chi-bin; Chu, Jin-guo; Kong, Jing-ping; Sun, Ding-he; Gao, Xiang; Weng, Xing-bei; Chen, Xue-qin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31
786,Laboratory data analysis of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) screening in 2510 patients,"Abstract Background Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment. We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. Method We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. Result COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P < 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection. The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.","Yun, Hu; Sun, Zhuoran; Wu, Jun; Tang, Aiguo; Hu, Min; Xiang, Zhongyuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.018,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

We developed a multiplex rRT-PCR methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods Three genes were used for multiplex rRT-PCR: the Sarbecovirus specific E gene, the SARS-CoV-2 specific N gene, and the human ABL1 gene as an internal control. Results Good correlation of Cq values was observed between the simplex and multiplex rRT-PCR methodologies. Low copies (<25 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected by the novel multiplex rRT-PCR method. Conclusion The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians.","Ishige, Takayuki; Murata, Shota; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Miyabe, Akiko; Kitamura, Kouichi; Kawasaki, Kenji; Nishimura, Motoi; Igari, Hidetoshi; Matsushita, Kazuyuki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.023,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.023,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

790,CT characteristics of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus: association with clinical type,"AIM To summarise the features of chest computed tomography (CT) of a series of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) to speed up recognition and have a better understanding of COVID-19 disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical information and chest CT images of 93 patients infected with 2019-nCov from multiple centres were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 93 cases, abnormalities in 91 cases were located at the subpleural level, presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO; n=69, 74.2%) and consolidation (n=56, 60.2%) in multiple lobes. Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections. CONCLUSION The CT and clinical appearances of COVID-19 are variable and reflect the severity of COVID-19 to some extent.","Wang, J.; Xu, Z.; Wang, J.; Feng, R.; An, Y.; Ao, W.; Gao, Y.; Wang, X.; Xie, Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

796,"COVID-19 Coronavirus spike protein analysis for synthetic vaccines, a peptidomimetic antagonist, and therapeutic drugs, and analysis of a proposed achilles’ heel conserved region to minimize probability of escape mutations and drug resistance","Abstract This paper continues a recent study of the spike protein sequence of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is also in part an introductory review to relevant computational techniques for tackling viral threats, using COVID-19 as an example. Q-UEL tools for facilitating access to knowledge and bioinformatics tools were again used for efficiency, but the focus in this paper is even more on the virus. Subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV of the S2′ spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage site continues to appear important. Here it is shown to be recognizable in the common cold coronaviruses, avian coronaviruses and possibly as traces in the nidoviruses of reptiles and fish. Its function or functions thus seem important to the coronaviruses. It might represent SARS-CoV-2 Achilles’ Heel, less likely to acquire resistance by mutation, as has happened in some early SARS vaccine studies discussed in the previous paper. Preliminary conformational analysis of the receptor (ACE2) binding site of the spike protein is carried suggesting that while it is somewhat conserved, it appears to be more variable than KRSFIEDLLFNKV. However compounds like emodin that inhibit SARS entry, apparently by binding ACE2, might also have functions at several different human protein binding studies. The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is again argued to be a convenient model pharmacophore perhaps representing an ensemble of targets, and it is noted that it occurs both in lung and alimentary tract. Perhaps it benefits the virus to block an inflammatory response by inhibiting the dehydrogenase, but a fairly complex web involves several possible targets.","Robson, B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103749,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103749,Elsevier,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103749,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11
797,Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images,"Abstract The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients.","Ozturk, Tulin; Talo, Muhammed; Yildirim, Eylul Azra; Baloglu, Ulas Baran; Yildirim, Ozal; Rajendra Acharya, U.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103792,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103792,Elsevier,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103792,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

800,Comparison of Hospitalized Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1,"Background Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019, considerable attention has been focused on its elucidation. However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. Research question The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. Study Design and Methods This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. Results The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the COVID-19 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao 2/Fio 2 of 198.2 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao 2/Fio 2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). Interpretation There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","Tang, Xiao; Du, Ronghui; Wang, Rui; Cao, Tanze; Guan, Lulu; Yang, Chengqing; Zhu, Qi; Hu, Ming; Li, Xuyan; Li, Ying; Liang, Lirong; Tong, Zhaohui; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huanzhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26

804,The Role of Chest Imaging in Patient Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multinational Consensus Statement from the Fleischner Society,"Abstract With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis. The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey D.; Ryerson, Christopher J.; Haramati, Linda B.; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W.; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B.K.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Kong, Christina; Altes, Talissa; Bush, Andrew; Desai, Sujal R.; Goldin, Jonathan; Goo, Jin Mo; Humbert, Marc; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Luo, Fengming; Mazzone, Peter J.; Prokop, Mathias; Remy-Jardin, Martine; Richeldi, Luca; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M.; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Wells, Athol U.; Leung, Ann N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

809,Risk Factors of Fatal Outcome in Hospitalized Subjects With Coronavirus Disease 2019 From a Nationwide Analysis in China,"Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency. The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China. Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain. Research Question The goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model. Study Design and Methods A retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. Results In this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level > 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level > 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97). The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation. Interpretation The proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.","Chen, Ruchong; Liang, Wenhua; Jiang, Mei; Guan, Weijie; Zhan, Chen; Wang, Tao; Tang, Chunli; Sang, Ling; Liu, Jiaxing; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Yahua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jianming; Liu, Jiyang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhijian; Qiu, Shaoqin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Changjiang; Zhu, Shaoyong; Liu, Xiaoqing; Cheng, Linling; Ye, Feng; Zheng, Jinping; Zhang, Nuofu; Li, Yimin; He, Jianxing; Li, Shiyue; Zhong, Nanshan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

811,Management of Lung Nodules and Lung Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: CHEST Expert Panel Report,"Abstract Background The risks from potential exposure to COVID-19, and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

812,Regional Planning for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Allocation During COVID-19,"Abstract Health systems confronting the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic must plan for surges in ICU demand and equitably distribute resources to maximize benefit for critically ill patients and the public during periods of resource scarcity. For example, morbidity and mortality could be mitigated by a proactive regional plan for the triage of mechanical ventilators. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This article explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one United States metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this article aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19. It also addresses the ethical and practical aspects of not continuing to offer ECMO during a disaster.","Prekker, Matthew E.; Brunsvold, Melissa E.; Bohman, J.

813,Postmortem Lung Findings in an Asthmatic with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Abstract Asthma is increasingly recognized as an underlying risk factor for severe respiratory disease in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, particularly in the United States. Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37-year-old asthmatic man, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID-19 less than two weeks after presentation to the hospital. His lungs showed mucus plugging and other histologic changes attributable to asthma, as well as early diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and a fibrinous pneumonia. The presence of DAD is similar to descriptions of autopsy lung findings from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and the absence of a neutrophil-rich acute bronchopneumonia differs from the histologic changes typical of influenza. The relative contribution of mucus plugging to his hypoxemia is unknown.","Konopka, Kristine E.; Wilson, Allecia; Myers, Jeffrey L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.032,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie COVID-19. Méthode: Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats: Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement, et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité COVID+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion: Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Abstract Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Pour évaluer l’évolution de l’activité des différents centres pratiquant l’ECT, une enquête nationale en ligne a été réalisée. 65 réponses de toute la France ont été analysées. Plus de 90 % des centres pratiquant l’ECT ont connu une diminution de leur activité. Plus inquiétant encore, la moitié des centres ont subi un arrêt total de leur activité et un quart des centres accusent une diminution de plus de la moitié de leur activité habituelle. Les soins psychiatriques post-pandémie COVID-19 s’annoncent difficiles. Il est essentiel de ne pas ajouter à cette difficulté les complications, souvent graves, qui seront liées au retard ou à l’arrêt de la pratique de l’ECT. Il conviendra aussi de rester vigilant quant aux conséquences spécifiques neuropsychiatriques qui feront suite à la pandémie. Abstract The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to major organisational changes in health care settings, especially in psychiatric hospitals. We conducted a national online survey to assess the evolution of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the different centres practicing this treatment. 65 responses from all over France were analysed. More than 90 % of the centres practising ECT experienced a decrease in their activity. Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity. Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult. It is essential not to add to this difficulty the complications, often serious, that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice of ECT. It will also be necessary to remain vigilant with regard to the specific neuropsychiatric consequences that will follow the pandemic.","Amad, Ali; Magnat, Maéva; Quilès, Clélia; Yrondi, Antoine; Sauvaget, Anne; Bulteau, Samuel; Plaze, Marion; Rotharmel, Maud; Polosan, Mircea; Lévy-Chavagnat, Diane; Jaafari, Nematollah; Vaiva, Guillaume; Thomas, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.004,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
822,Conséquences psychopathologiques du confinement,"Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","Mengin, Amaury; Alle, Mélissa; Rolling, Julie; Ligier, Fabienne; Schroder, Carmen; Lalanne, Laurence; Berna, Fabrice; Jardri, Renaud; Vaiva, Guillaume; Geoffroy, Pierre A; Brunault, Paul; Thibaut, Florence; Chevance, Astrid; Giersch, Anne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
823,Les professionnels de santé face à la pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19): quels risques pour leur santé mentale?,"RÉSUMÉ Objectifs: La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L'objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes: Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats: Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, morts de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail, ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions: Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. ABSTRACT Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Lemogne, Cédric; Yrondi, Antoine; Brunault, Paul; Bienvenu, Thomas; Etain, Bruno; Paquet, Claire; Gohier, Bénédicte; Bennabi, Djamila; Birmes, Philippe; Sauvaget, Anne; Fakra, Eric; Prieto, Nathalie; Bulteau, Samuel; Vidailhet, Pierre; Jollant, Fabrice; Camus, Vincent; Leboyer, Marion; Krebs, Marie-Odile; Aouizerate, Bruno",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Between uncertainties linked to the lack of data and speculations about possible benefits of psychotropics against the coronavirus, we propose here elements allowing to base the pharmacotherapeutic decisions potentially useful in Covid+ patients with psychiatric disorders.","Javelot, H; Llorca, P M; Meyer, G; Fossati, P; Haffen, E",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.009,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
825,Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19: étude reCoVery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comprises a total of more than 2 350 000 cases and 160 000 deaths. The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (∼4 %) compared to health care professionals (∼14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ + standard-of-care (CPZ + SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ + SOC group, compared to the SOC group: A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its 'LARGe ACTion' properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","Plaze, Mario; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-Cécile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chrétien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Raphaël",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

828,"COVID-19, una emergencia de salud pública mundial","Resumen Un nuevo brote de coronavirus surgió el pasado 31 de diciembre de 2019 en Wuhan, China, causando conmoción entre la comunidad médica y el resto del mundo. Esta nueva especie de coronavirus fue denominada como 2019-nCoV, causante de un gran número de casos y fallecimientos en China y en cantidad creciente fuera de ella, convirtiéndose en una emergencia de salud pública a nivel mundial. 2019-nCoV es un virus con alta homología con otros coronavirus patogénicos, como los originados por zoonosis con murciélagos (SARS-CoV) causantes de aproximadamente 646 muertes en China a principios de la década. Su tasa de mortalidad no es tan elevada (aproximadamente del 2-3%), pero su rápida propagación ha propiciado la activación de protocolos para detener su diseminación. Este patógeno tiene el potencial para convertirse en pandemia, por lo que es vital seguir las recomendaciones de cuidado personal dictadas por la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Abstract A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31st of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world. This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation.","Palacios Cruz, M.; Santos, E.; Velázquez Cervantes, M.A.; León Juárez, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

Design observational, cross-sectional study Setting Tertiary referral center Patients Thirty-four adult Chinese males diagnosed with COVID-19 through confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab samples Intervention None Main Outcome Measures Identification of SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR of single ejaculated semen samples. Semen quality was not assessed. Expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human testis are explored through previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets. Results Six patients (19%) demonstrated scrotal discomfort concerning for viral orchitis around the time of COVID-19 confirmation. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in semen after a median of 31 days (IQR: 29-36 days) from COVID-19 diagnosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrates sparse expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with almost no overlapping gene expression. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the semen of patients recovering from COVID-19 one month after COVID-19 diagnosis. ACE2-mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells is unlikely to occur within the human testicle based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.

839,"Prior and Novel Coronaviruses, COVID-19, and Human Reproduction: What Is Known?","Structured Abstract Objective To summarize current understanding of the effects of novel and prior coronaviruses on human reproduction, specifically male and female gametes, and in pregnancy. Design Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6, 2020. Methods Manuscripts were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, including pathophysiology and pregnancy. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Reproductive outcomes; effects on gametes; pregnancy outcomes; neonatal complications. Results Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. SARS-CoV-1 may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following COVID-19 infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or MERS, but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. COVID-19 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. Conclusion COVID-19 infection may adversely affect some pregnant women and their offspring.

SARS-CoV-2, the culprit virus, is highly contagious and stable in the environment and predominantly transmits among humans via the respiratory route. Accumulating evidence suggest that this virus, like many of its related viruses, may also be an enteric virus that can spread via the fecal-oral route. Such a hypothesis would also contribute to the rapidity and proliferation of this pandemic. Here we briefly summarize what is known about this family of viruses and literature basis of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting the gastrointestinal tract and shedding in the environment for potential human-to-human transmission.","Ding, Siyuan; Liang, T.

869,COVID-19 pandemic and personal protective equipment shortage: protective efficacy comparing masks and scientific methods for respirator reuse,"Abstract Background and Aims The abrupt outbreak of COVID-19 and its rapid spread over many health care systems in the world led to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortening, which cannot be faced only by the reduction in their consumption nor by the expensive and time-requiring implementation of their production. It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy among them and promoting an effective technique to reuse them. Methods A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar and from 25 top cited papers, 15 were selected for relevance and impact. Results Most studies on prior respiratory virus epidemic to date suggest surgical masks not to be inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among health care workers. The use of N95 respirators should be then limited in favor of high-risk situations. Concerning respirators reuse, highly energetic short-wave ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirators decontamination from viral respiratory agents, but it requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biological target. Conclusions Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help facing PPE shortening during a pandemic. Further evidences testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need. The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning: these groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.","Boškoski, Ivo; Gallo, Camilla; Wallace, Michael B.; Costamagna, Guido",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
870,COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing before endoscopy: an economic analysis,"Abstract Background and Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has limited endoscopy utilization, causing significant health and economic losses. We aim to model the impact of PCR testing into resuming endoscopy practice. Methods We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches―Strategy 1: endoscopy for urgent indications only; Strategy 2: testing for semi-urgent indications; and Strategy 3: testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence, and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed/cancelled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from literature. Results During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategy 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semi-urgent and elective cases. Investing 22USD and 105USD in testing per patient allowed completing 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies respectively. False negative results were seen after testing 4,700 patients (or 3 months applying Strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 health care workers infected. Conclusion PCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.","Corral, Juan E.; Hoogenboom, Sanne A.; Kröner, Paul T.; Vazquez-Roque, Maria I.; Picco, Michael F.; Farraye, Francis A.; Wallace, Michael B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.049,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.049,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
871,A proposal for the return to routine endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions and gastroenterological societies around the world have suspended nonurgent endoscopy. Subject to country-specific variability, it is projected that with current mitigation measures in place, the peak incidence of active COVID-19 infections may be delayed by over 6 months. Although this aims to prevent the overburdening of healthcare systems, prolonged deferral of elective endoscopy will become unsustainable. Herein, we propose that by incorporating readily available point-of-care tests and conducting accurate clinical risk assessments, a safe and timely return to elective endoscopy is feasible. Our algorithm not only focuses on the safety of patients and healthcare workers, but also assists in rationalizing the use of invaluable resources such as personal protective equipment.","Gupta, Sunil; Shahidi, Neal; Gilroy, Nicole; Rex, Douglas K.; Burgess, Nicholas G.; Bourke, Michael J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.050,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.050,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

873,Doomsday preppers and the architecture of dread,"Abstract Prepping is a practice of anticipating and adaptating to impending conditions of calamity, ranging from low-level crises to extinction-level events. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid-level' event, and which many of them were well-prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn - potentially even into an improved milieu.","Garrett, Bradley",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.03.014,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

875,Response to “The imaginary ‘Asian Super Consumer’: A critique of demand reduction campaigns for the illegal wildlife trade”,"Abstract In a recent paper in Geoforum, Margulies et al. (2019) outline what they perceive as a bias toward an “Asian super consumer”. They argue that wildlife trade demand reduction campaigns are unfocused, untargeted, and therefore have a tendency to place blame on people of colour and communities in the Global South as key actors in driving illegal wildlife trade. As researchers and practitioners, we have been studying the demand for wildlife and wildlife products for many years. While we agree that it is vitally important to consider the cultural nuances of illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade and to operate in a manner that is respectful toward different cultures, we believe that the authors have overlooked the fact that modern wildlife trade demand reduction campaigns are already conducting this research and using it to target their campaigns to specific groups.","Bergin, Daniel; Wu, Derek; Meijer, Wander",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.04.009,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

879,Teaching-practice as a critical bridge for narrowing the research-practice gap,"Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Marketing-management researchers and teachers ironically have their own challenge of taking what can be a complex theory (the marketing academic equivalent of a “sausage”) and making it “sizzle”.","Kriz, Anton; Nailer, Christopher; Jansen, Karen; Potocnjak-Oxman, Camilo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

888,Transport and deposition of hygroscopic particles in asthmatic subjects with and without airway narrowing,"Abstract This study numerically investigates the effect of hygroscopicity on transport and deposition of particles in severe asthmatic lungs with distinct airway structures. The study human subjects were selected from two imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters with one characterized by non-constricted airways and the other by constricted airways in the lower left lobe (LLL). We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1–8 μm) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer. On average, the deposition fraction increased by about 6% due to hygroscopic particle growth in the cluster subjects with constricted airways, while it increased by only about 0.5% in those with non-constricted airways. The effect of particle growth was most significant for particles with an initial diameter of 2 μm in the cluster subjects with constricted airways. The effect diminished with increasing particle size, especially for particles with an initial diameter larger than 4 μm. This suggests the necessity to differentiate asthmatic subjects by cluster in engineering the aerosol size for tailored treatment. Specifically, the treatment of severe asthmatic subjects who have constricted airways with inhalation aerosols may need submicron-sized hygroscopic particles to compensate for particle growth, if one targets for delivering to the peripheral region. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.","Rajaraman, Prathish K.; Choi, Jiwoong; Hoffman, Eric A.; O'Shaughnessy, Patrick T.; Choi, Sanghun; Delvadia, Renishkumar; Babiskin, Andrew; Walenga, Ross; Lin, Ching-Long",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105581,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105581,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105581,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
889,Effects of colostrum instead of formula feeding for the first 2 days postnatum on whole-body energy metabolism and its endocrine control in neonatal calves,"ABSTRACT Colostrum provides high amounts of nutritive and non-nutritive substrates, which are essential for calf nutrition and passive immunization. Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","Liermann, W.; Schäff, C.T.; Gruse, J.; Derno, M.; Weitzel, J.M.; Kanitz, E.; Otten, W.; Hoeflich, A.; Stefaniak, T.; Sauerwein, H.; Bruckmaier, R.M.; Gross, J.J.; Hammon, H.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17708,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17708,Elsevier,10.3168/jds.2019-17708,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
890,The ABC of society: Perceived similarity in agency/socioeconomic success and conservative-progressive beliefs increases intergroup cooperation,"Abstract The dimensions that explain which societal groups cooperate more with which other groups remain unclear. We predicted that perceived similarity in agency/socioeconomic success and conservative-progressive beliefs increases cooperation across groups. Self-identified members (N = 583) of 30 society-representative U.S. groups (gays, Muslims, Blacks, upper class, women, Democrats, conservatives etc.) played an incentivized one-time continuous prisoner's dilemma game with one self-identified member of each of these groups. Players knew nothing of each other except one group membership. Consistent with the ABC (agency-beliefs-communion) model of spontaneous stereotypes, perceived self-group similarity in agency and beliefs independently increased expected and actual cooperation across groups, controlling for shared group membership. Similarity in conservative-progressive beliefs had a stronger effect on cooperation than similarity in agency, and this effect of similarity in beliefs was stronger for individuals with extreme (progressive or conservative) compared to moderate beliefs.","Koch, Alex; Dorrough, Angela; Glöckner, Andreas; Imhoff, Roland",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103996,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103996,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103996,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

In all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 2019-nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2%, and a strong ability to spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine. For this purpose, the means of bioinformatics, applied in the context of reverse-vaccinology paradigm, can be of fundamental help to select the most promising peptides able to trigger an effective immune response. In this short report, using the concept of nullomer and introducing a distance from human self, we provide a list of peptides that could deserve experimental investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.","Santoni, Daniele; Vergni, Davide",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2020.112787,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2020.112787,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jim.2020.112787,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

897,Phylogenetic Analysis and Structural Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Reveals an Evolutionary Distinct and Proteolytically Sensitive Activation Loop,"Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) originally arose as part of a major outbreak of respiratory disease centered on Hubei province, China. It is now a global pandemic and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be a Betacoronavirus (lineage B) closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been reported to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Subsequently, betacoronaviruses from pangolins were identified as close relatives to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we perform structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV and all other coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage B, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C, and be a key component in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with this structural loop affecting virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A.; André, Nicole M.; Chappie, Joshua S.; Millet, Jean K.; Whittaker, Gary R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmb.2020.04.009,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

All the synthesized compounds were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential of all the synthesized compounds (3a-k) was evaluated by MTT and Hoechst 33258 staining assay respectively whereas their antioxidant properties were determined via DPPH free radical scavenging assay. The most active compounds (3a, 3c and 3k) showed significant cytotoxic potential against HeLa cells with an inhibition of cell viability that ranged between 28.54 and 44.67% (P < 0.001). Albeit statistically different, the anti-proliferative effect of 3c was in close match with that of the reference drug doxorubicin. Likewise, the test compounds showed profound pro-apoptotic potential with an apoptotic index that ranged between 52.86 and 75.61%. Besides, the docking studies revealed a higher efficiency for compounds (3a and 3h) owing to their better affinity and inhibition constant (Ki = 4.397 and 3.713 nmol) respectively.

899,Anticancer activity studies of novel metal complexes of ligands derived from polycyclic aromatic compound via greener route,"Abstract Methoxy and tert-butyl substituted carboxamide, carboxylic acid and hydrazone Schiff base groups have been assembled into our newly designed fluorenone based ligands and prepared coordination compounds of some first row transition metals and characterized thoroughly with spectroscopic (1H and 13C NMR, IR, GC–MS, UV–Vis), analytical, TGA and molar conductance measurements. The stoichiometry of all the metal complexes is found to be 1: 2 (M: L2) with the general formula, [M(L)2], where L is a singly deprotonated ligand and the geometry of all the metal complexes is found to be octahedral. Ligands and their metal complexes successfully cleaved the pBR322 plasmid DNA and in case of anticancer activity against MCF–7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cell line, the synthesized compounds found to exhibit excellent activity with prominent apoptotic effect which is characterized by cell shrinkage, cell breakage and turgidity and results were compared with the standard drug cisplatin. Very significant anticancer activity was observed for compounds L1H, Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2)2, Ni(L1)2 and Ni(L2)2 with IC50 value of <10 μgmL−1. Molecular docking studies were performed to assess the bonding mode of synthesized compounds.

A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200 nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.","Petrov, Dmitry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107005,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

928,"Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): A molecular docking study","Abstract Aims A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.","Elfiky, Abdo A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,Elsevier,10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

With the possibility that a considerable proportion of the world’s population soon could receive COVID-19 pharmacotherapies with torsadogenic potential for therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, this document serves to help health care professionals mitigate the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias while minimizing risk of COVID-19 exposure to personnel and conserving the limited supply of personal protective equipment.","Giudicessi, John R.; Noseworthy, Peter A.; Friedman, Paul A.; Ackerman, Michael J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
932,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Antihypertensives (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) in Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being defined as the worst pandemic disease of modern times. Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.","Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lavie, Carl J.; Perez-Quilis, Carme; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

937,Association Between Hypoxemia and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19,"Abstract Objective To identify markers associated with in-hospital death in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pneumonia. Patients and Methods Retrospective, cohort study of 140 patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19 associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted from January 28th, 2020 to February 28th, 2020, and followed up through March, 13th 2020 in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. Results Of 140 patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, 51.4% were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 ≤90% were older, more likely to be men, to have hypertension and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 >90%. Overall, 36 (25.7%) patients died during hospitalization after a median 14-day follow-up. Higher post-oxygen supplementation SpO2 levels were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-unit SpO2 0.93, 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95, P < .001). SpO2 cutoff of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.60; 95% confidence interval 1.24-5.43, P = .01). Conclusions In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide clinical management of severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.","Xie, Jiang; Covassin, Naima; Fan, Zhengyang; Singh, Prachi; Gao, Wei; Li, Guangxi; Kara, Tomas; Somers, Virend K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.04.006,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

948,Marked Up-Regulation of ACE2 in Hearts of Patients with Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Implications for SARS-CoV-2-Mediated COVID-19,"Abstract Objective To explore the transcriptomic differences between patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and controls. Patients and Methods RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and from 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All HCM patients were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999 and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. Results Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4-6% of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of COVID-19, the transcript for ACE2, a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change 3.53, q-value=1.30x10-23), which was confirmed with qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold-change 3.78; p=5.22x10-4), and Western blot confirmed a >5-fold over-expression of ACE2 protein (fold-change 5.34, p=1.66x10-6). Conclusions Over 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM indicating perhaps the heart’s compensatory effort to mount an anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic response. However, given that the SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.","Bos, J.

958,Low-density lipoprotein is a potential predictor of poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019,"Abstract Background The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global threat to public health. The lipid pathophysiology in COVID-19 is unknown. Methods In this retrospective longitudinal study, we monitored the serum lipids in 17 surviving and 4 non-surviving COVID-19 cases prior to their viral infections and duration the entire disease courses. Results In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0–4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3–3.1), p < 0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3–3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7–4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9–1.2), p = 0.02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing odds of lowered LDL levels associated with disease progression (odds ratio: 4.48, 95% IC: 1.55–12.92, p = 0.006) and in-hospital death (odds ratio: 21.72, 95% IC: 1.40–337.54, p = 0.028). Conclusions LDL levels inversely correlated to disease severities, which could be a predictor for disease progress and poor prognosis.","Fan, Junli; Wang, Hui; Ye, Guangming; Cao, Xiaoling; Xu, Xianqun; Tan, Wenbin; Zhang, Yongxi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154243,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154243,Elsevier,10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154243,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
959,Obesity as a risk factor for greater severity of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease,"Abstract Background & Aims. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020. Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. Methods 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China were consecutively enrolled. Sixty-six patients with MAFLD were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the current management guideline. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI >25 kg/m2. Results The presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~ 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted-OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19–27.91, p = .029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.16–34.54, p = .033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.","Zheng, Kenneth I.; Gao, Feng; Wang, Xiao-Bo; Sun, Qing-Feng; Pan, Ke-Hua; Wang, Ting-Yao; Ma, Hong-Lei; Liu, Wen-Yue; George, Jacob; Zheng, Ming-Hua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154244,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154244,Elsevier,10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154244,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

968,The Race to Zero?: China's Poaching of Taiwan's Diplomatic Allies,"Abstract The election of Tsai Ing-wen as President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2016 reignited Beijing's quest to poach Taiwan's diplomatic allies. Between her election in January 2016 and reelection in January 2020, Taiwan has lost seven countries to China. After eight years of a “diplomatic truce” under President Ma Ying-jeou, China re-started its multi-pronged strategy to pressure Taiwan into eventual unification, and one of the key tactics is to poach all of Taiwan's now-15 remaining diplomatic allies to eliminate its international legitimacy. This article seeks to explain what, if any, benefits formal diplomatic relations provide Taiwan and the ways in which Beijing induces countries to switch ties. It concludes by providing recommendations for what actions the United States can undertake to slow the impending completion of the “race to zero.”","Shattuck, Thomas J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04
969,"Foreign Policy through Other Means: Hard Power, Soft Power, and China's Turn to Political Warfare to Influence the United States","Abstract The People's Republic of China increasingly has turned to political warfare and sharp power to influence U.S. policy toward China and on international issues that it considers important. This turn in part reflects the limited effectiveness of Beijing's much-increased hard power and its never-formidable and now-reduced soft power as means to achieve China's ends with the United States. China's political warfare and uses of sharp power pursue both direct influence on U.S. policy and indirect impact through affecting American attitudes toward China and China-related issues. China's efforts range across many sectors—including business, culture, media, education, and more—and they have prompted reactions and countermeasures. In China's view, the United States has long been engaged in something like political warfare or sharp power undertakings targeting China. If, or as, U.S.-China relations continue to become more adversarial, political warfare, uses of sharp power, and measures to counter them are likely to increase.","deLisle, Jacques",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04

971,Molecular and pathogenicity of infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus) in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica),"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection is highly infectious respiratory disease in poultry industry with significant economic importance. The prevalence of IBV in quail industry in Malaysia was not well documented; therefore, its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown. This study was to determine the susceptibility of Japanese quail, as one of the species in commercial poultry industry, toward IBV. In addition, it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental study on IBV inoculation in quail. In this experimental study, 20 quails were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 for group A, B, and C, n = 5 for control group). The quails in group A, B, and C were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 mL of 10 × 5 EID50 of the virus. Clinical signs, gross lesions, positive detection of virus, and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these Japanese quails. The results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds. Trachea, lung, and kidney were subjected to one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection. The virus was found from trachea and lung samples, whereas it was absent from all kidney samples. Only 3 quails were found with gross lesions. There was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 ± 0.845 (P < 0.05) within the treatment groups. In summary, Japanese quails might be susceptible to IBV.","Fadhilah, A.S.; Kai, T.H.; Lokman, H.I.; Yasmin, N.A.R.; Hafandi, A.; Hasliza, A.H.; Tengku Rinalfi, T.A.; Hezmee, M.N.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
972,"Effect of essential oils on the immune response to some viral vaccines in broiler chickens, with special reference to Newcastle disease virus","Abstract This trial assessed the efficacy of a commercial essential oils (Eos) product on the immune response to vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) and subsequent challenge with virulent ND virus genotype VII (vNDv genotype VII) by using the following experimental groups of broiler chickens (each group had 21 birds with three replicates in each, n=seven): NC (negative control), PC (positive control), VC (vaccinated), and VTC (vaccinated and treated with EOs). Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preventive or therapeutic measure, two additional ND-vaccinated groups were used (PRV: medicated one day before vNDv challenge for 5 days; and TTT: medicated two days post vNDv challenge for 5 days). In addition, the immune-modulatory effect of EOs on the avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC) revealed lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs and post mortem lesion score (11) comparing to ND vaccines alone (VC) (52.28% mortality and score 15), in addition to lower hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (p<0.05) (6.5±0.46) and viral shedding (10 log 2.28±0.24) titres one week post challenge in comparison with of VC (8.63±0.65 and 10 log 3.29±0.72, respectively). Nevertheless, the EOs mixture (VTC) (1952±28.82) did not significantly (p>0.05) improve growth performance compared to the non-treated birds (NC and VC) (1970±19.56 and 1904±38.66). Essential oils showed an antiviral effect on vNDv in vivo (in chickens) as a preventive measure (PRV) as well as some therapeutic effect (TTT) through decreasing the viral shedding titres (loNC0), mortality rate, and severity of clinical signs and post mortem lesions, in addition to serum malondialdhyde (MDA) level. Regarding the other viruses, the EOs mixture did not improve the immune response to the AI and IB vaccines but significantly (p<0.05) increased the ELISA antibody titre for IBD virus at 28th day of age (2108±341.05). The studied EOs mixture showed an immune stimulating response to ND and IBD vaccines, antiviral effect against ND virus especially if administered before the challenge, however it did not have a growth promoting effect.","El-Shall, Nahed A.; Shewita, Ramadan S.; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E.; AlKahtane, Abdullah; Alarifi, Saud; Alkahtani, Saad; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M.; Sedeik, Mahmoud E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

975,The impact of 2019 novel coronavirus on heart injury: A systemic review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Evidence about COVID-19 on cardiac injury is inconsistent. Objectives We aimed to summarize available data on severity differences in acute cardiac injury and acute cardiac injury with mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We performed a systematic literature search across Pubmed, Embase and pre-print from December 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, to identify all observational studies that reported cardiac specific biomarkers (troponin, creatine kinase–MB fraction, myoglobin, or NT-proBNP) during COVID-19 infection. We extracted data on patient demographics, infection severity, comorbidity history, and biomarkers during COVID-19 infection. Where possible, data were pooled for meta-analysis with standard (SMD) or weighted (WMD) mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results We included 4189 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients from 28 studies. More severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher mean troponin (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.75, p < 0.001), with a similar trend for creatine kinase–MB, myoglobin, and NT-proBNP. Acute cardiac injury was more frequent in those with severe, compared to milder, disease (risk ratio 5.99, 3.04 to 11.80; p < 0.001). Meta regression suggested that cardiac injury biomarker differences of severity are related to history of hypertension (p = 0.030). Also COVID19-related cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality (summary risk ratio 3.85, 2.13 to 6.96; p < 0.001). hsTnI and NT-proBNP levels increased during the course of hospitalization only in non-survivors. Conclusion The severity of COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury, and acute cardiac injury is associated with death. Cardiac injury biomarkers mainly increase in non-survivors. This highlights the need to effectively monitor heart health to prevent myocarditis in patients infected with COVID-19.","Li, Jing-Wei; Han, Tian-Wen; Woodward, Mark; Anderson, Craig S.; Zhou, Hao; Chen, Yun-Dai; Neal, Bruce",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pcad.2020.04.008,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

984,How to improve adherence with quarantine: Rapid review of the evidence,"Abstract Objectives The January 2020 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to ‘self-isolate’ if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design Rapid evidence review. Methods We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","Webster, Rebecca K.; Brooks, Samantha K.; Smith, Louise E.; Woodland, Lisa; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, G.

On January 20, 2020, Chinese expert group confirmed that the spread of the virus is characterized by human-to-human transmission. Study Design It is difficult for the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by only wearing masks, and the most important measureto take is to cut off the route of transmission; otherwise, there is noway to control the disease. Methods The Wuhan Municipal Governmentannounced the control of the migration of the population in Wuhan, and population migration in Hubei Province also continues to be monitored after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission.Unfortunately, some problems remain. Results At the beginning of the epidemic breakout, there were not enough hospital beds for the patients in Wuhan, and a large number of patients were required to self-solate at home. Therefore, home isolation poses significant risks. Conclusions The patient will transmit the virus to other people in the houseif a patient has been confirmed to have the virus and is under home isolation.This can lead to the infection of the patient's entire family.","Feng, Zhan-hui; Cheng, Yong-ran; Ye, Lan; Zhou, Meng-Yun; Wang, Ming-Wei; Chen, Juan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)–based system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting. Study design Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. Methods The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM–based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. Results Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%). Conclusion Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to rely on an antibody-based rapid test for public health measures such as community screenings.","Döhla, M.; Boesecke, C.; Schulte, B.; Diegmann, C.; Sib, E.; Richter, E.; Eschbach-Bludau, M.; Aldabbagh, S.; Marx, B.; Eis-Hübinger, A.-M.; Schmithausen, R.M.; Streeck, H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.009,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

Study design A qualitative study was conducted in China involving interviews with key informants in the field of health response to CBRN disasters. Methods One-on-one in-depth interviews were carried out with 20 participants, including expert members of National Medical Response Teams for CBRN Disasters, officials at emergency management authorities, and scholars of academic institutions related to CBRN emergency. Interviews were recorded with audio equipment, transcribed and coded into codable passages according to grounded theory with NVivo software. Themes were identified within the transcriptions by using thematic analysis. Results 159 codable passages were produced. Eight domains of nontechnical core competencies were identified: (1) situation awareness, (2) communication skills, (3) collaboration, (4) resource management, (5) task management, (6) cultural competency, (7) austere environment skills, and (8) physical stamina. Conclusions The study identified a variety of competencies for on-scene public health responders in CBRN emergencies. The findings of this study could specifically benefit development of strategy and improvement of content of education and training.

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020 in all 3,139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without shelter in place orders. Results Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to < 10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% over the counties with no SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. Conclusions Shelter in place orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a shelter in place order.","Cobb, J.S.; Seale, M.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.016,Elsevier,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.016,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

El 7 de enero del 2020, las autoridades chinas identificaron como agente causante del brote un nuevo tipo de virus de la familia Coronaviridae, denominado SARS-CoV-2. Desde entonces, se han notificado miles de casos con una diseminación global. Las infecciones en humanos provocan un amplio espectro clínico que va desde infección leve del tracto respiratorio superior, hasta síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo grave y sepsis. No existe un tratamiento específico para SARS-CoV-2, motivo por lo que los aspectos fundamentales son establecer medidas adecuadas de prevención y el tratamiento de soporte y manejo de las complicaciones. Abstract In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and health Commission (Hubei Province, China) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology. On January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified as a causative agent of the outbreak a new type of virus of the Coronaviridiae family, called SARS-CoV-2. Since then, thounsands of cases have been reported with global dissemination.

1000,Dos terapias conocidas podrían ser efectivas como adyuvantes en el paciente crítico infectado por COVID-19,"Resumen La neumonía causada por coronavirus, que se originó en Wuhan, China, a finales de 2019, se ha extendido por todo el mundo convirtiéndose en una pandemia. Desafortunadamente, a día de hoy no existe ninguna vacuna específica para el virus COVID-19, y el tratamiento está siendo de soporte con añadido de antivirales y otros fármacos, sin que hasta la fecha se haya evidenciado un beneficio claro. Muchos de estos pacientes se deterioran rápidamente y requieren ser intubados y ventilados mecánicamente, lo que está provocando el colapso del sistema sanitario en muchos países debido a la falta de ventiladores y de camas de críticos. En este documento revisamos dos terapias adyuvantes sencillas de aplicar, sin efectos deletéreos y de un coste bajo que podrían ser de utilidad para el tratamiento de la infección por coronavirus agudo severo asociado al síndrome respiratorio agudo (SARS-CoV-2). La vitaminaC, un potente antioxidante, se ha convertido en una terapia relevante debido a sus beneficios potenciales cuando se administra por vía intravenosa. El efecto potencial de la vitaminaC en la reducción de la inflamación en los pulmones podría desempeñar un papel clave en la lesión pulmonar causada por la infección por coronavirus. Otra posible terapia eficaz es el ozono. Pese a la controversia que siempre le ha acompañado, se ha estudiado y utilizado ampliamente durante muchos años y su eficacia se ha demostrado en múltiples estudios. Sin embargo, nuestro objetivo no es hacer una revisión exhaustiva de dichas terapias sino difundir sus efectos beneficiosos. Obviamente, los ensayos clínicos son necesarios, pero dado el potencial beneficio de estas terapias, recomendamos incorporarlas al arsenal terapéutico para el tratamiento del SARS-CoV-2. Abstract Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","Hernández, A.; Papadakos, P.J.; Torres, A.; González, D.A.; Vives, M.; Ferrando, C.; Baeza, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.004,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14

Actualmente la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha definido la infección como pandemia y existe una situación de emergencia sanitaria y social para el manejo de esta nueva infección. Mientras que la mayoría de las personas con COVID-19 desarrollan solo una enfermedad leve o no complicada, aproximadamente el 14% desarrollan una enfermedad grave que requiere hospitalización y oxígeno, y el 5% pueden requerir ingreso en una Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. En casos severos, COVID-19 puede complicarse por el síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda (SDRA), sepsis y shock séptico y fracaso multiorgánico. Este documento de consenso se ha preparado sobre directrices basadas en evidencia desarrolladas por un panel multidisciplinario de profesionales médicos de cuatro sociedades científicas españolas (Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias [SEMICYUC], Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica [SEPAR], Sociedad Española de Urgencias y Emergencias [SEMES], Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor [SEDAR]) con experiencia en el manejo clínico de pacientes con COVID-19 y otras infecciones virales, incluido el SARS, así como en sepsis y SDRA. El documento proporciona recomendaciones clínicas para el soporte respiratorio no invasivo (ventilación no invasiva, oxigenoterapia de alto flujo con cánula nasal) en cualquier paciente con presentación sospechada o confirmada de COVID-19 con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda. Esta guía de consenso debe servir como base para una atención optimizada y garantizar la mejor posibilidad de supervivencia, así como permitir una comparación fiable de las futuras intervenciones terapéuticas de investigación que formen parte de futuros estudios observacionales o de ensayos clínicos. Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Cinesi Gómez, C.; Peñuelas Rodríguez, Ó.; Luján Torné, M.l; Egea Santaolalla, C.; Masa Jiménez, J.F.; García Fernández, J.; Carratalá Perales, J.M.; Heili-Frades, S.B.; Ferrer Monreal, M.; de Andrés Nilsson, J.M.; Lista Arias, E.; Sánchez Rocamora, J.L.; Garrote, J.I.; Zamorano Serrano, M.J.; González Martínez, M.; Farrero Muñoz, E.; Mediano San Andrés, O.; Rialp Cervera, G.; Mas Serra, A.; Hernández Martínez, G.; de Haro López, C.; Roca Gas, O.; Ferrer Roca, R.; Romero Berrocal, A.; Ferrando Ortola, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.redar.2020.03.006,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

1003,Guidance for the care of neuromuscular patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak from the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network,"Abstract In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers. In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2 months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/ immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.","Solé, G; Salort-Campana, E; Pereon, Y; Stojkovic, T; Wahbi, K; Cintas, P; Adams, D; Laforet, P; Tiffreau, V; Desguerre, I; Pisella, LI; Molon, A; Attarian, S",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.neurol.2020.04.004,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

1011,The future of manufacturing: a Delphi-based scenario analysis on Industry 4.0,"Abstract Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’ comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.","Culot, Giovanna; Nassimbeni, Guido; Orzes, Guido; Sartor, Marco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120092,Elsevier,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120092,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1012,Some simple rules for estimating reproduction numbers in the presence of reservoir exposure or imported cases,"Abstract For many diseases, the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is a threshold parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 < 1 ), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","McLure, Angus; Glass, Kathryn",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tpb.2020.04.002,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1013,New insights into the evolutionary features of viral overlapping genes by discriminant analysis,"Abstract Overlapping genes originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing frame induce the expression of a de novo protein from an alternative frame. In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Pavesi, Angelo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02
1014,Human mastadenovirus-B (HAdV-B)-specific E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ glycoproteins interact with each other and localize at the plasma membrane of non-polarized airway epithelial cells,"Abstract The E3 region of all simian and human types classified within species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) encodes two unique highly conserved ORFs of unknown function designated E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ. We generated a HAdV-3 mutant encoding small epitope tags at the N-termini of both E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ (HAdV-3 N-tag wt) and a double knock out (HAdV-3 N-tag DKO) mutant virus that does not express either protein. Our studies show that HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are type I transmembrane proteins that are produced predominantly at late times post infection, are glycosylated, co-localize at the plasma membrane of non-polarized epithelial cells, and interact with each other. At their extreme C-termini HAdV-B E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ possess a conserved di-leucine motif followed by a class II PDZ domain binding motif (PBM). HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are dispensable for virus growth, progeny release, spread, and plaque formation in A549 cells.","Lakshmi Narayan, Poornima Kotha; Kajon, Adriana E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.005,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31
1015,"Coronavirus in water environments: Occurrence, persistence and concentration methods - A scoping review","Abstract Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C–25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.","La Rosa, Giuseppina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Kenmoe, Sebastien; Suffredini, Elisabetta",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115899,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115899,Elsevier,10.1016/j.watres.2020.115899,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

1017,"A short review of bioaerosol emissions from gas bioreactors: Health threats, influencing factors and control technologies","Abstract Bioaerosols have widely been a concern due to their potential harm to human health caused by the carrying and spreading of harmful microorganisms. Biofiltration has been generally used as a green and effective technology for processing VOCs. However, bioaerosols can be emitted into the atmosphere as secondary pollutants from the biofiltration process. This review presents an overview of bioaerosol emissions from gas bioreactors. The mechanism of bioaerosols production and the effect of biofiltration on bioaerosol emissions were analyzed. The results showed that the bioaerosol emission concentrations were generally exceeded 104 CFU m−3, which would damage to human health. Biomass, inlet gas velocity, moisture content, temperature, and some other factors have significant influences on bioaerosol emissions. Moreover, as a result of the analysis done herein, different inactivation technologies and microbial immobilization of bioaerosols were proposed and evaluated as a potential solution for reducing bioaerosols emissions. The purpose of this paper is to make more people realize the importance of controlling the emissions of bioaerosols in the biofiltration process and to make the treatment of VOCs by biotechnology more environmentally friendly. Additionally, the present work intends to increase people’s awareness in regards to the control of bioaerosols, including microbial fragment present in bioaerosols.","Hu, Xu-Rui; Han, Meng-Fei; Wang, Can; Yang, Nan-Yang; Wang, Yong-Chao; Duan, Er-Hong; Hsi, Hsing-Cheng; Deng, Ji-Guang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126737,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126737,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126737,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31
1018,Risk factors for predicting mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19: a review of clinical data in China,"Abstract While elderly patients are at high risk of fatality, research concerning COVID-19 has largely been done on clarifying the clinical features. As such, the present work aims to identify risk factors for mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19. Given that single-centre studies are less likely informative as elderly remains a minority in the total Chinese population, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources in the public domain. Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. Against mixed results, more research should be done on identifying comorbidities associated with mortality in geriatric patients.","Leung, Char",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111255,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111255,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mad.2020.111255,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

1021,COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic,"Abstract The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.","Vellingiri, Balachandar; Jayaramayya, Kaavya; Iyer, Mahalaxmi; Narayanasamy, Arul; Govindasamy, Vivekanandhan; Giridharan, Bupesh; Ganesan, Singaravelu; Venugopal, Anila; Venkatesan, Dhivya; Ganesan, Harsha; Rajagopalan, Kamarajan; Rahman, Pattanathu K.S.M.; Cho, Ssang-Goo; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Subramaniam, Mohana Devi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
1022,Real-time estimation and prediction of mortality caused by COVID-19 with patient information based algorithm,"Abstract The global COVID-19 outbreak is worrisome both for its high rate of spread, and the high case fatality rate reported by early studies and now in Italy. We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.","Wang, Lishi; Li, Jing; Guo, Sumin; Xie, Ning; Yao, Lan; Cao, Yanhong; Day, Sara W.; Howard, Scott C.; Graff, J.

The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Spearman-rank correlation test was used for data analysis. Among the components of the weather, only temperature average (°C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic (r = 0.392; p < .01). The finding serves as an input to reduce the incidence rate of covid-19 in Indonesia.","Tosepu, Ramadhan; Gunawan, Joko; Effendy, Devi Savitri; Ahmad, La Ode Ali Imran; Lestari, Hariati; Bahar, Hartati; Asfian, Pitrah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138436,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138436,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138436,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
1024,Factors determining the diffusion of COVID-19 and suggested strategy to prevent future accelerated viral infectivity similar to COVID,"Abstract This study has two goals. The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths. The second is to suggest a strategy to cope with future epidemic threats having accelerated viral infectivity in society. Using data on N = 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter) or ozone in previous years. In particular, hinterland cities with average higher number of days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (and a low intensity of wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean about 2200 infected, with average polluted days greater than 80), than coastal cities also having days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 or ozone but with high intensity of wind speed (arithmetic mean about 944.70 infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days); moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM10), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution, they have a lower average number of infected individuals (about 1014). The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days. Moreover, results here reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities under study seems to be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion (on 17th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p < 0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p < 0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b′1 = 0.81, p < 0.001) also because of indirect effect of lockdown, whereas coefficient of transmission by interpersonal contacts has stability (b′2 = 0.31, p < 0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmissions dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of “air pollution-to-human transmission” rather than “human-to-human transmission”. Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study of Italy suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is to also apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities- having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog days-that seem to have an environment that may damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, healthcare and health sector.","Coccia, Mario",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138474,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138474,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138474,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1025,Changes in air quality during the lockdown in Barcelona (Spain) one month into the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic,"Abstract Lockdown measures came into force in Spain from March 14th, two weeks after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to reduce the epidemic curve. Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (−45 to −51%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (−28 to −31.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (+33 to +57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.","Tobías, Aurelio; Carnerero, Cristina; Reche, Cristina; Massagué, Jordi; Via, Marta; Minguillón, María Cruz; Alastuey, Andrés; Querol, Xavier",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138540,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138540,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138540,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11
1026,"Pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu-like epidemics. A Dutch study into the inverse relation between pollen counts, hay fever and flu-like incidence 2016–2019","Abstract There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid-19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.","Hoogeveen, Martijn J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138543,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138543,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138543,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
1027,Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality,"Abstract Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an ambient trace-gas result of both natural and anthropogenic processes. Long-term exposure to NO2 may cause a wide spectrum of severe health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, heart and cardiovascular diseases and even death. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between long-term exposure to NO2 and coronavirus fatality. The Sentinel-5P is used for mapping the tropospheric NO2 distribution and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for evaluating the atmospheric capability to disperse the pollution. The spatial analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78%) were in five regions located in north Italy and central Spain. Additionally, the same five regions show the highest NO2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which prevent an efficient dispersion of air pollution. These results indicate that the long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world.","Ogen, Yaron",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138605,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138605,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138605,15/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-15
1028,Association between short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Evidence from China,"Abstract The novel coronavirus pneumonia, namely COVID-19, has become a global public health problem. Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-μg/m3 increase (lag0–14) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively. However, a 10-μg/m3 increase (lag0–14) in SO2 was associated with a 7.79% decrease (95% CI: −14.57 to −1.01) in COVID-19 confirmed cases. Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection, which could partially explain the effect of national lockdown and provide implications for the control and prevention of this novel disease.","Yongjian, Zhu; Jingu, Xie; Fengming, Huang; Liqing, Cao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138704,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138704,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138704,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1029,Investigation of effective climatology parameters on COVID-19 outbreak in Iran,"Abstract SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronavirus cases are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into quarantine. A better understanding of the effective parameters in infection spreading can bring about a logical measurement toward COVID-19. The effect of climatic factors on spreading of COVID-19 can play an important role in the new Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, the main parameters, including the number of infected people with COVID-19, population density, intra-provincial movement, and infection days to end of the study period, average temperature, average precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and average solar radiation investigated to understand how can these parameters effects on COVID-19 spreading in Iran? The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol’-Jansen methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.","Ahmadi, Mohsen; Sharifi, Abbas; Dorosti, Shadi; Ghoushchi, Saeid Jafarzadeh; Ghanbari, Negar",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138705,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138705,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138705,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
1030,Effectiveness of the measures to flatten the epidemic curve of COVID-19. The case of Spain,"Abstract After the cases of COVID-19 skyrocketed, showing that it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, the governments of many countries launched mitigation strategies, trying to slow the spread of the epidemic and flatten its curve. The Spanish Government adopted physical distancing measures on March 14; 13 days after the epidemic outbreak started its exponential growth. Our objective in this paper was to evaluate ex-ante (before the flattening of the curve) the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the Spanish Government to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. Our hypothesis was that the behavior of the epidemic curve is very similar in all countries. We employed a time series design, using information from January 17 to April 5, 2020 on the new daily COVID-19 cases from Spain, China and Italy. We specified two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with variable response from the Gaussian family (i.e. linear mixed models): one to explain the shape of the epidemic curve of accumulated cases and the other to estimate the effect of the intervention. Just one day after implementing the measures, the variation rate of accumulated cases decreased daily, on average, by 3.059 percentage points, (95% credibility interval: −5.371, −0.879). This reduction will be greater as time passes. The reduction in the variation rate of the accumulated cases, on the last day for which we have data, has reached 5.11 percentage points. The measures taken by the Spanish Government on March 14, 2020 to mitigate the epidemic curve of COVID-19 managed to flatten the curve and although they have not (yet) managed to enter the decrease phase, they are on the way to do so.","Saez, Marc; Tobias, Aurelio; Varga, Diego; Barceló, Maria Antònia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138761,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138761,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138761,20/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-20
1031,Prediction for the spread of COVID-19 in India and effectiveness of preventive measures,"Abstract The spread of COVID-19 in the whole world has put the humanity at risk. The resources of some of the largest economies are stressed out due to the large infectivity and transmissibility of this disease. Due to the growing magnitude of number of cases and its subsequent stress on the administration and health professionals, some prediction methods would be required to predict the number of cases in future. In this paper, we have used data-driven estimation methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in India 30 days ahead and effect of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. The prediction of various parameters (number of positive cases, number of recovered cases, etc.) obtained by the proposed method is accurate within a certain range and will be a beneficial tool for administrators and health officials.","Tomar, Anuradha; Gupta, Neeraj",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138762,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138762,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138762,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1032,First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: A proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community,"Abstract Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.","Ahmed, Warish; Angel, Nicola; Edson, Janette; Bibby, Kyle; Bivins, Aaron; O'Brien, Jake W.; Choi, Phil M.; Kitajima, Masaaki; Simpson, Stuart L.; Li, Jiaying; Tscharke, Ben; Verhagen, Rory; Smith, Wendy J.M.; Zaugg, Julian; Dierens, Leanne; Hugenholtz, Philip; Thomas, Kevin V.; Mueller, Jochen F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138764,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138764,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138764,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1033,COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China is associated with temperature and humidity: A time-series analysis,"Abstract COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily count of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004–0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","Qi, Hongchao; Xiao, Shuang; Shi, Runye; Ward, Michael P.; Chen, Yue; Tu, Wei; Su, Qing; Wang, Wenge; Wang, Xinyi; Zhang, Zhijie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138778,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138778,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138778,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

The present day is dominated by studies on determining the factors that affect, taking preventive actions, and trying to find an effective treatment on top priority. Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases. The present study examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey. In this regard, temperature (°C), dew point (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed (mph) are considered as parameters of weather. Research states that the incubation period of COVID-19 varies from 1 day to 14 days. Therefore, the effects of each parameter within 1, 3, 7, and 14 days are examined. In addition, the population is included as an effective parameter for evaluation. The analyses are conducted based on Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results showed that the highest correlations were observed for population, wind speed 14 days ago, and temperature on the day, respectively.

1035,Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,"Abstract Factors associated with negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients have not yet been systematically determined. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, China. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent factors for time to viral RNA negative conversion. Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed. A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0–2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission. Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10–18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6–10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results. Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.205–0.698) and chest tightness (HR: 0.290; 95%CI: 0.091–0.919) were factors indecently affecting negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Headache (odds ratio: 7.553; 95%CI: 1.011–28.253) was significantly associated with intermittent negative status, with a predicted probability of 60%. Older age and chest tightness were independently associated with delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients. These predictors would provide a new perspective on early identification of patients with prolonged viral shedding and facilitate optimal isolation protocols and treatment strategies.","Hu, Xiaowen; Xing, Yuhan; Jia, Jing; Ni, Wei; Liang, Jiwei; Zhao, Dan; Song, Xin; Gao, Ruqin; Jiang, Fachun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138812,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138812,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138812,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Our research shows that there is a significant association between contingency measures and improvement in air quality, clean beaches and environmental noise reduction. On the other hand, there are also negative secondary aspects such as the reduction in recycling and the increase in waste, further endangering the contamination of physical spaces (water and land), in addition to air. Global economic activity is expected to return in the coming months in most countries (even if slowly), so decreasing GHG concentrations during a short period is not a sustainable way to clean up our environment.","Zambrano-Monserrate, Manuel A.; Ruano, María Alejandra; Sanchez-Alcalde, Luis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

Countries all over the world have implemented some sort of lockdown to slow down its infection and mitigate it. Lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic fronts. However, this lockdown also have some positive effect on natural environment. Recent data released by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency) indicates that pollution in some of the epicenters of COVID-19 such as Wuhan, Italy, Spain and USA etc. has reduced up to 30%.

1038,Restructured society and environment: A review on potential technological strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at December 2019 had led to a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the disease started to spread all over the world and became an international public health issue. The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances.

1039,Overview of Covid-19; its prevention and management in the light of Unani medicine,"Abstract Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic, named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm. The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission is also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms. Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.","Nikhat, Sadia; Fazil, Mohammad",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138859,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138859,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138859,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1040,Temperature significantly changes COVID-19 transmission in (sub)tropical cities of Brazil,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.","Prata, David N.; Rodrigues, Waldecy; Bermejo, Paulo H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138862,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138862,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138862,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
1041,"Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges","Abstract With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods.","Hart, Olga E.; Halden, Rolf U.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138875,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1042,"SutteARIMA: Short-term forecasting method, a case: Covid-19 and stock market in Spain","Abstract The purpose of our research is to predict the short-term of confirmed cases of covid-19 and IBEX in Spain by using SutteARIMA method. Covid-19 Spanish confirmed data obtained from Worldometer and Spain Stock Market data (IBEX 35) data obtained from Yahoo Finance. Data starts from 12 February 2020–09 April 2020 (the date on Covid-19 was detected in Spain). The data from 12 February 2020–02 April 2020 using to fitting with data from 03 April – 09 April 2020. Based on the fitting data, we can doing short forecast for 3 future period (10 April – 12 April 2020 for Covid-19 and 14 April – 16 April 2020 for IBEX). In this study, the SutteARIMA method will be used. For the evaluation of the forecasting methods we applied forecasting accuracy measures, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Based on the results of ARIMA and SutteARIMA forecasting methods, we conclude that the SutteARIMA method is most suitable than ARIMA to calculate the daily forecasts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 and IBEX in Spain. The MAPE value of 0.1905 (smaller than 0.04 compared to MAPE value of ARIMA) for confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain and 0,0202 for IBEX stock. At the end of the analysis, using the SutteARIMA method, we calculate daily forecasts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain from 10 April 2020 until 12 April 2020 and Spain Stock Market from 14 April until 16 April 2020.","Ahmar, Ansari Saleh; del Val, Eva Boj",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138883,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138883,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138883,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1043,GIS-based spatial modeling of COVID-19 incidence rate in the continental United States,"Abstract During the first 90 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, over 675,000 confirmed cases of the disease have been announced, posing unprecedented socioeconomic burden to the country. Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model; these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.","Mollalo, Abolfazl; Vahedi, Behzad; Rivera, Kiara M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138884,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138884,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138884,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1044,Impact of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"Abstract A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = −0.0100, 95% CI: −0.0125, −0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Peng; Dong, Yinqiao; Yan, Huanchang; Zhao, Chenkai; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wei; He, Miao; Tang, Shixing; Xi, Shuhua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138890,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138890,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138890,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1045,"Inter nation social lockdown versus medical care against COVID-19, a mild environmental insight with special reference to India","Abstract Infection by coronavirus (CoV-19) has led to emergence of a pandemic called as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) that has so far affected about 210 countries. The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature.","Paital, Biswaranjan; Das, Kabita; Parida, Sarat Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138914,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138914,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138914,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

It is based on a SIR model, with the addition of auxiliary and state variables that represent hospital capacity, contacts, contacts with infected, deaths, giving, as a result, a model of four stock variables. Similarly, using piecewise functions, it was possible to model the “quarantines” or lockdowns, and the effectiveness of reduction in the contacts, Results show the decrease in infected people due to the quarantines. The model was simulated for a population of 100,000. The simulations show trends of infections that could occur in three different scenarios: A) one extended lockdown (60 days), B) two medium lockdowns of 30 days, with a 30-day smart lockdown space, and C) an initial 40-day lockdown and then a 30-day smart lockdown. All the lockdowns start on day 25 after the first reported infection. The model presents a compact structure of broad understanding and successful capture of a COVID-19 outbreak and therefore provides an overview to improve knowledge of outbreak trends and quarantine effectiveness in reducing infection.","Vega, Danny Ibarra",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138917,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138917,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138917,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Using the Maximum-Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic under three intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) is simulated and predicted in South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are severe. The studies are also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the epidemic situations are growing rapidly and the socio-economic are relatively under-developed, resulting in more difficulties in preventing the epidemic. Results indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will increase by 1.43–1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction. In the end, a series of epidemic controlling methods are proposed, including patient quarantine, close contact tracing, population movement control, government intervention, city and county epidemic risk level classification, and medical cooperation and the Chinese assistance.","Zhao, Zebin; Li, Xin; Liu, Feng; Zhu, Gaofeng; Ma, Chunfeng; Wang, Liangxu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138959,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138959,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138959,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
1048,COVID-19 and surface water quality: Improved lake water quality during the lockdown,"Abstract Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: −10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 – April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.","Yunus, Ali P.; Masago, Yoshifumi; Hijioka, Yasuaki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139012,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

1050,Follow-up studies in COVID-19 recovered patients - is it mandatory?,"Abstract The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.","Balachandar, Vellingiri; Mahalaxmi, Iyer; Devi, Subramaniam Mohana; Kaavya, Jayaramayya; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Laldinmawii, Gracy; Arul, Narayanasamy; Reddy, Subbarami Janardhana Kumar; Sivaprakash, Palanisamy; Kanchana, Sivaprakash; Vivekanandhan, Govindasamy; Cho, Ssang-Goo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139021,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
1051,Effects of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 in 166 countries,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world. Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.","Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Ma, Qiuyue; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Yaping; Du, Min; Liu, Min",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139051,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139051,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
1052,Phenotyping for drought resistance in bread wheat using physiological and biochemical traits,"Abstract Drought is one of the most prominent limiting factors that negatively affect crop productivity by manipulating its physiological pathway. One hundred twenty diverse bread wheat genotypes were used in a pot experiment to explore the relationship among their fifteen physio-biochemical traits (PBT) by using multivariate analysis, heatmapping and stress tolerance index (STI) for grain yield as a marker trait to identify high yielding genotype with maximum stress tolerance capability. Increased proline and sugar accumulation were observed from control to moisture deficient environments by 159% and 122%, respectively. Moreover, leaf membrane stability index (LMSI), leaf relative water content (LRWC), relative dry weight (RDW), chlorophyll content, leaf surface area (LSA), Leaf succulence (LS), canopy temperature depression (CTD), relative excised leaf water loss (RELWL) and leaf osmotic potential (LOP) showed significantly decreasing trend in drought stress treatment as compared to well-watered plants by −21%, −21%, −34%, −22%, −38%, −37%, −46%, −18% and −35% respectively. Additionally, principal component analysis and genotype by trait biplot analysis showed that initial 7 principal components (PC1 to PC7) represented 77.27% and 79.02% of total cumulative variation under control and drought stress respectively. Genotypic-Phenotypic correlation revealed that most of the attributes were higher in case of genotypic correlation component (rg) as compared to the phenotypic correlation component (rp) indicating more genetic association between traits. The darker and lighter colour scale produced by heatmap exhibited contrasting nature of genotypes, as positive side with higher values represented drought resistance while values on the negative side with lower values showed susceptible performance of genotypes. Our results concluded that the studied PBT associated with STI for grain yield are the main factors which may contribute in improved productivity of wheat crop and if these traits show appropriate performance under stress condition the crop will show the more productive returns under changing climate.","Ahmed, Kashif; Shabbir, Ghulam; Ahmed, Mukhtar; Shah, Kausar Nawaz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139082,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139082,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139082,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1053,"Effect of lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic on air quality of the megacity Delhi, India","Abstract Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (−52.68%) and CO (−30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","Mahato, Susanta; Pal, Swades; Ghosh, Krishna Gopal",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139086,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139086,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139086,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1054,"COVID-19 pandemic: Impacts on the air quality during the partial lockdown in São Paulo state, Brazil","Abstract In early March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic, and in late March 2020 partial lockdown was ordered by the São Paulo State government. The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo – Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to −77.3%), NO2 (up to −54.3%), and CO (up to −64.8%) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen monoxide decreases. Although the partial lockdown has contributed to a positive impact on air quality, it is important to take into account the negative impacts on social aspects, considering the deaths caused by COVID-19 and also the dramatic economic effects.","Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Urban, Rodrigo Custodio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139087,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139087,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1055,"Nurture to nature via COVID-19, a self-regenerating environmental strategy of environment in global context","Abstract Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become the largest pandemic that has affected 210 countries. Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended. However, the self-revival rate of nature shall continue during post-lockdown period and a master plan must be adapted by national and international (mostly political) bodies to revive the Mother Nature completely.","Paital, Biswaranjan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139088,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139088,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139088,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1057,Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Introduction COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. Methods We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. Conclusion The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.","Klok, F.A.; Kruip, M.J.H.A.; van der Meer, N.J.M.; Arbous, M.S.; Gommers, D.A.M.P.J.; Kant, K.M.; Kaptein, F.H.J.; van Paassen, J.; Stals, M.A.M.; Huisman, M.V.; Endeman, H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.013,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1064,Forecasting the timeframe of coronavirus and human cells interaction with reverse engineering,"Abstract In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 [9]. Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the “entry receptor” for the infection process involving membrane fusion [10]. A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the “time delay” given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the “exposure time” to the “interaction time” (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. Conclusions From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1067,COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients,"By 21 March 2020 infections related to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had affected people from 177 countries and caused 11,252 reported deaths worldwide. Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of 32 patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever. Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.","Banerjee, Debasish; Popoola, Joyce; Shah, Sapna; Ster, Irina Chis; Quan, Virginia; Phanish, Mysore",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.018,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

1069,A single center observational study of the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of 20 kidney transplant patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.,"Abstract The outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients who have received a kidney allograft and are being treated with immunosuppression is unclear. We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.","Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Zambetti, Nicole; Moscato, Marianna; Venturini, Margherita; Affatato, Stefania; Gaggiotti, Mario; Bossini, Nicola; Scolari, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.002,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

1074,Teleurology in the Time of Covid-19 Pandemic: Here to Stay?,"Abstract Objective To assess the implementation and outcomes of telemedicine in a Department of Urology in Northern Italy during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. Results Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. Conclusion A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimum portion of face-to-face visit (<10% 1 month after the lockdown) was preserved mostly for suspected malignancy or potentially life-threatening conditions, telemedicine proved a pragmatic approach allowing efficient screening of cases and adequate protection for patients and clinicians.","Luciani, Lorenzo Giuseppe; Mattevi, Daniele; Cai, Tommaso; Giusti, Guido; Proietti, Silvia; Malossini, Gianni",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.004,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
1075,Managing Urology Consultations during COVID-19 Pandemic: Application of a Structured Care Pathway,"Abstract Objectives To describe and evaluate a risk-stratified triage pathway for inpatient urology consultations during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. Methods Consultations to the urology service during a three-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of three pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non- COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Results Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone. No team member developed COVID-19 infection. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, most urology consultations can be managed in a patient and physician safety-conscious manner, by implementing a novel triage pathway.","Borchert, Alex; Baumgarten, Lee; Dalela, Deepansh; Jamil, Marcus; Budzyn, Jeffrey; Kovacevic, Natalija; Yaguchi, Grace; Palma-Zamora, Isaac; Perkins, Sara; Bazzi, Mahdi; Wong, Phil; Sood, Akshay; Peabody, James; Rogers, Craig G; Dabaja, Ali; Atiemo, Humphrey",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.059,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.059,Elsevier,10.1016/j.urology.2020.04.059,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

1079,Anti-cancer therapy and clinical trial considerations for gynecologic oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis,"Abstract Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has consumed considerable resources and has impacted the delivery of cancer care. Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. Methods An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. Results COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. Conclusions The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care. When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice.","Pothuri, Bhavana; Secord, Angeles Alvarez; Armstrong, Deborah K.; Chan, John; Huh, Warner; Kesterson, Joshua; Liu, Joyce F.; Moore, Kathleen; Fader, Amanda N.; Westin, Shannon N.; Naumann, R.

1084,Bronchial mucosal inflammation and illness severity in response to experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD,"Abstract Background Respiratory viral infection causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. We previously reported increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil and neutrophil inflammation in COPD experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. But it is unclear whether virus per se induces bronchial mucosal inflammation, nor whether this relates to exacerbation severity. Objectives To determine the extent and nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation following experimental rhinovirus (RV)-16-induced COPD exacerbations and its relationship to disease severity. Methods Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes were determined at pre-infection baseline and following experimental RV infection in 17 GOLD stage II COPD subjects and as controls, 20 smokers and 11 non-smokers, with normal lung function. No subject had a history of asthma/allergic rhinitis: all were negative for aero-allergen skin prick tests. Results RV-infection increased the numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils only in COPD and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in COPD and non-smokers. Monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes were increased in all subjects. At baseline, compared to non-smokers, COPD subjects and smokers had increased numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes but fewer numbers of CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes. The virus-induced inflammatory cells in COPD were positively associated with virus load, illness severity and reductions in lung function. Conclusion Experimental rhinovirus infection induces bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia only in COPD and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in both COPD and control subjects. The virus-induced inflammatory cell phenotypes observed in COPD positively related to virus load, illness severity. Anti-viral/anti-inflammatory therapies could attenuate bronchial inflammation and ameliorate virus-induced COPD exacerbations.","Zhu, Jie; Mallia, Patrick; Footitt, Joseph; Qiu, Yusheng; Message, Simon D.; Kebadze, Tatiana; Aniscenko, Julia.; Barnes, Peter.J.; Adcock, Ian M.; Kon, Onn M.; Johnson, Malcolm; Contoli, Marco; Stanciu, Luminita A.; Papi, Alberto; Jeffery, Peter K.; Johnston, Sebastian L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaci.2020.03.021,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1086,Risk factors for severity and mortality in adult COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan,"Abstract Background In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan. Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. Objective The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have high risk of death.","Li, Xiaochen; Xu, Shuyun; Yu, Muqing; Wang, Ke; Tao, Yu; Zhou, Ying; Shi, Jing; Zhou, Min; Wu, Bo; Yang, Zhenyu; Zhang, Cong; Yue, Junqing; Zhang, Zhiguo; Renz, Harald; Liu, Xiansheng; Xie, Jungang; Xie, Min; Zhao, Jianping",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.006,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

1089,Plasma IP-10 and MCP-3 levels are highly associated with disease severity and predict the progression of COVID-19,"Abstract Background The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, December 2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health, highlighting the urgent need of identifying biomarkers for disease severity and progression. Objective To identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. Results Fourteen cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IP-10, MCP-3, HGF, MIG and MIP-1α, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the five cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IP-10 and MCP-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the two cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations with a value of 0.99. Conclusion In this study, we report biomarkers that highly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19.

1091,Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sulfolipid-1 Activates Nociceptive Neurons and Induces Cough,"Summary Pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifests with a persistent cough as both a primary symptom and mechanism of transmission. The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","Ruhl, Cody R.; Pasko, Breanna L.; Khan, Haaris S.; Kindt, Lexy M.; Stamm, Chelsea E.; Franco, Luis H.; Hsia, Connie C.; Zhou, Min; Davis, Colton R.; Qin, Tian; Gautron, Laurent; Burton, Michael D.; Mejia, Galo L.; Naik, Dhananjay K.; Dussor, Gregory; Price, Theodore J.; Shiloh, Michael U.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05

Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These findings shed light on the viral pathogenesis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic countermeasures against the emerging virus.","Wang, Qihui; Zhang, Yanfang; Wu, Lili; Niu, Sheng; Song, Chunli; Zhang, Zengyuan; Lu, Guangwen; Qiao, Chengpeng; Hu, Yu; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Wang, Qisheng; Zhou, Huan; Yan, Jinghua; Qi, Jianxun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09
1093,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Engineered Human Tissues Using Clinical-Grade Soluble Human ACE2,"Summary We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Monteil, Vanessa; Kwon, Hyesoo; Prado, Patricia; Hagelkrüys, Astrid; Wimmer, Reiner A.; Stahl, Martin; Leopoldi, Alexandra; Garreta, Elena; Hurtado del Pozo, Carmen; Prosper, Felipe; Romero, Juan Pablo; Wirnsberger, Gerald; Zhang, Haibo; Slutsky, Arthur S.; Conder, Ryan; Montserrat, Nuria; Mirazimi, Ali; Penninger, Josef M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
1094,The Architecture of SARS-CoV-2 Transcriptome,"Summary SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported recently, its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Kim, Dongwan; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Kim, Jun Won; Kim, V.

Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.","Abbott, Timothy R.; Dhamdhere, Girija; Liu, Yanxia; Lin, Xueqiu; Goudy, Laine; Zeng, Leiping; Chemparathy, Augustine; Chmura, Stephen; Heaton, Nicholas S.; Debs, Robert; Pande, Tara; Endy, Drew; La Russa, Marie F.; Lewis, David B.; Qi, Lei S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.020,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1096,CRISPR in livestock: From editing to printing,"Abstract Precise genome editing of large animals applied to livestock and biomedicine is nowadays possible since the CRISPR revolution. This review summarizes the latest advances and the main technical issues that determine the success of this technology. The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time- and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health. The challenge is no longer technical. Controversies and consensus, opportunities and threats, benefits and risks, ethics and science should be reconsidered to enter into the CRISPR era.","Menchaca, A.; dos Santos-Neto, P.C.; Mulet, A.P.; Crispo, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,29/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-29
1097,Small animal reproduction: Scientific facts versus dogmas or unverified beliefs,"Abstract Small Animal Reproduction is a rather recent topic in the field of Animal Reproduction. Although some continuing educational societies aim to improve the level of general knowledge, published scientific facts are still limited, and there are many hypotheses or affirmations that remain unverified or even sometimes dogmatic or empirical. Through examples, this article reviews the main causes that may sometimes challenge a veterinary practitioner faced with a dog or a cat presenting reproductive problems. It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific proof or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verifiedIn addition, to make it more challenging to seek for the information, there are unverifiedaffirmations,unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity. The growing interest for research in Small Animal Reproduction will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.","Fontbonne, Alain",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

1103,Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19): Implications for Clinical Dental Care,"Abstract The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international community and has caused widespread public health concerns. Despite global efforts to contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection. This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature. Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection. In addition, specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.","Ather, Amber; Patel, Biraj; Ruparel, Nikita B.; Diogenes, Anibal; Hargreaves, Kenneth M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

1105,Characteristics of Endodontic Emergencies during COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan,"Abstract Introduction In late 2019 an outbreak of a new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in Wuhan, China. A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise and high fever. During this time several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University (WHUSS). Here, we examined the characteristics of these patients. Methods A total of 96 patients with mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited General and Emergency Department of WHUSS due to endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, gender, age, systemic diseases history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiological investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, endodontic diagnosis determined for the offending tooth and verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. Results Of total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had fever (>37.2°C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%) and patients of this group showed significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6-19 years group and 20-34 years group (p<0.05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnosis was diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess showed significantly higher mean VNRS Score than that of other groups (p<0.05). Conclusion Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time resulting in reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases. Rubber dam, personal protective equipment and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.","Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tian; Zhao, Dan; Haapasalo, Markus; Shen, Ya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.joen.2020.04.001,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1110,COVID-19 y enfermedad cardiovascular,"Resumen En diciembre de 2019 en Wuhan en la provincia de Hubei en China, se reportó un grupo de 27 pacientes con neumonía de etiología desconocida, vinculados con exposición al mercado de mariscos, pescado y animales vivos. El 7 de enero de 2020, se identificó una nueva sepa de coronavirus aislada en estos pacientes (SARS-CoV-2); la enfermedad producida por este virus ha sido denominada COVID-19. Durante las etapas iniciales de la pandemia y dados los pocos estudios publicados al respecto, se creía que este coronavirus causaba síntomas netamente respiratorios; sin embargo, a medida que el número de pacientes aumentó, se observó que la enfermedad cardiovascular tenía un papel fundamental en el desarrollo y pronóstico de la infección. Los factores de riesgo más importantes relacionados con mortalidad son la edad y la presencia de comorbilidades, especialmente de tipo cardiovascular. El incremento en niveles de troponina, péptidos natriuréticos y dímero-D tiene valor pronóstico en pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2. Los pacientes con COVID-19 tienen un aumento en el riesgo de infarto agudo del miocardio, miocarditis, insuficiencia cardiaca, choque, arritmias y muerte súbita, en relación con la respuesta sistémica al virus y a los tratamientos necesarios en la fase aguda. En este documento se revisa el compromiso cardiovascular por SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Abstract In December 2019, in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China, there was a report on a group of 27 patients with a pneumonia of unknown origin, linked to exposure in a market with shellfish, fish, and live animals. In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase. A review is presented in this article of the cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Triana, Juan Francisco Figueroa; Márquez, Diego Alfredo Salas; Silva, Juan Sebastián Cabrera; Castro, Cristian Camilo Alvarado; Sandoval, Andrés Felipe Buitrago",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rccar.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rccar.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rccar.2020.04.004,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

1113,Cuidado respiratorio en COVID-19,"Resumen Antecedentes El COVID-19 forma parte de la familia de los virus conocida como Coronaviridae. El nuevo patógeno β-coronavirus del subgénero Sarbecovirus se denominó inicialmente como el nuevo coronavirus (2019-nCoV); fue identificado en un brote de neumonía en Wuhan. Los pacientes desarrollan alteraciones en el sistema respiratorio, pudiendo llegar a padecer neumonía severa, edema pulmonar o síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda. Objetivo Revisar la evidencia científica disponible relacionada con el cuidado del sistema respiratorio, estableciendo pautas generales de tratamiento. Métodos Revisión narrativa de la literatura. Se realizó una búsqueda, selección y revisión de artículos originales y secundarios escritos en inglés o español, en las diferentes bases de datos: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE y EMBASE, publicados hasta marzo del 2020. Resultados No se ha definido un tratamiento específico ante la nueva enfermedad, teniendo como principal medida terapéutica el control sintomático. Se recomienda utilizar elementos de bioseguridad: gafas, gorros, guantes, bata larga impermeable, tapabocas de alta eficiencia en personal sanitario (FFP2 o N95). En el paciente sintomático, utilizar tapabocas quirúrgico, jabón hospitalario, toallas de papel y alcohol al 70% o isopropílico. Utilizar oxígeno mediante sistemas de bajo flujo. En ventilación mecánica, programar modos VCP o VCV, Vt 4-6ml/kg, Fr≤35, FiO2 para PaO2 de 60mmHg o SpO2 de 92-96%, PEEP 12-17cmH2O, ventilación prono si PAFI≤150 con una relación 16/8 o 18/6, óxido nítrico 5-20ppm. Conclusiones Usar equipos de bioseguridad con el fin de interrumpir la transmisión. En hipoxemia, utilizar sistemas de oxigenoterapia a bajo flujo. Usar estrategias de protección pulmonar, disminución de volúmenes corrientes, presiones de meseta y frecuencias respiratorias, implementación de valores de PEEP elevados, bajos valores de presión de conducción y ventilación en prono, los cuales han demostrado mejoraría en la hipoxemia y la sobrevida en pacientes con síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda. Abstract Background COVID-19 is part of the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae. The new pathogen β-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading to severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Objective To review the available scientific evidence related to the care of the respiratory system in order to establish general treatment guidelines. Methods Narrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search, selection, and review of original and secondary articles written in English or Spanish in the different databases: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to March 2020. Results No specific treatment for the new disease has been defined, with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure. The use of biosecurity elements, such as goggles, hats, gloves, long waterproof aprons, high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel (FFP2 or N95) is recommended. In symptomatic patients use surgical masks, hospital soap, paper towels, and 70% alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Use oxygen through low flow systems. A mechanical ventilation program in VCP or VCV modes, Vt 4-6ml/Kg, Fr≤35, FiO2 for PaO2 =60mmHg or SpO2 92-96%, PEEP 12-17cmH2O, prone ventilation if PAFI≤150 with ratio 16/8 or 18/6, nitric oxide 5-20ppm. Conclusions Use biosecurity equipment in order to prevent transmission. In hypoxaemia use low flow oxygen therapy systems. Use lung protection strategies, decrease in tidal volumes, plateau pressures and respiratory rates, plus implementation of high PEEP values, low conduction pressure values and prone ventilation. These have been shown to improve hypoxaemia and survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Chica-Meza, Carmen; Peña-López, Luis Alexander; Villamarín-Guerrero, Héctor Fabio; Moreno-Collazos, Jorge Enrique; Rodríguez-Corredor, Lizeth Catherine; Lozano, Wilson Mauricio; Vargas-Ordoñez, Mónica Patricia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
1114,Infeccion Por Sars-Cov-2 En La Paciente Obstetrica: Una Perspectiva Desde El Cuidado Critico,"ABSTRACT The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is currently the leading public health problem in the world. Between 5% and 30% of patients affected by this disease require management in an intensive care unit. Different documents have been published with recommendations for the general population. However, in the obstetric patient, the scientific evidence is limited, and even more so when it comes to COVID-19 infection in obstetric intensive care settings. For this reason, an unsystematic narrative review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, scientific societies, as well as the repositories of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia as sources of information, in order to describe the management of a pregnant patient with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia. A description is also presented of some recommendations on relevant topics in the critical scenario that include, among others, timely intubation, the adequate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the management of circulatory failure, as well as fluid and vasopressor restriction strategies.","Borre, Diana; Santacruz, Jose; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Jeniffer; Anichiarico, Walter; Romero, Jorge Rubio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.002,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

Las Unidades de Cuidados Intensivos son uno de los principales recursos de los sistemas sanitarios dada la tasa de neumonías complicadas que presentan los pacientes infectados. En respuesta a los distintos lineamientos y diferentes niveles de evidencia de la información disponible, la Asociación Colombiana de Medicina crítica y Cuidados Intensivos (AMCI), convocó un equipo multidisciplinario de expertos en medicina crítica para establecer una declaratoria de consenso de buena práctica clínica para la atención de pacientes con COVID-19. Su objetivo es facilitar y estandarizar la toma de decisiones en los aspectos más relevantes desde la organización administrativa de las áreas de atención hasta el abordaje clínico del paciente, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad del personal sanitario, la infraestructura y recursos con los que cuenta el país para responder a la emergencia.

1118,Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries,"Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). Interpretation Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

1121,"Health sector spending and spending on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and development assistance for health: progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 3","Summary Background Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available. Methods We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US$, unless otherwise stated. Findings Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching $7·9 trillion (95% uncertainty interval 7·8–8·0) in 2017 and is expected to increase to $11·0 trillion (10·7–11·2) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was $20·2 billion (17·0–25·0) and on tuberculosis it was $10·9 billion (10·3–11·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was $5·1 billion (4·9–5·4). Development assistance for health was $40·6 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, $374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81·6% (81·6–81·7) in 2015 to 83·1% (82·8–83·3) in 2030. Interpretation Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.

1122,COVID-19 and Italy: what next?,"Summary The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","Remuzzi, Andrea; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30627-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30627-9,Elsevier,10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30627-9,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

1128,Fangcang shelter hospitals: a novel concept for responding to public health emergencies,"Summary Fangcang shelter hospitals are a novel public health concept. They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.","Chen, Simiao; Zhang, Zongjiu; Yang, Juntao; Wang, Jian; Zhai, Xiaohui; Bärnighausen, Till; Wang, Chen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,Elsevier,10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

1148,SARS-CoV-2 and viral sepsis: observations and hypotheses,"Summary Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have tried every effort to understand the disease, and a brief portrait of its clinical features have been identified. In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19.

1168,"Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial","Summary Background No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Findings Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. Interpretation In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

This is a call for the R&D community, particularly in the polymer degradation and stability arena, to engage and collaborate with virology and bio-medical experts. We require comparative R&D for extended, reuse and recyclability options, as well as large scale approaches and methods that could quickly be applied on the local level by the public who are not experts and may only have limited resources.","Dargaville, Tim; Spann, Kirsten; Celina, Mathew",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.109162,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.109162,Elsevier,10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.109162,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05
1171,A cutting-edge immunoinformatics approach for design of multi-epitope oral vaccine against dreadful human malaria,"Abstract Human malaria is a pathogenic disease mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which was responsible for about 405,000 deaths globally in the year 2018. To date, several vaccine candidates have been evaluated for prevention, which failed to produce optimal output at various preclinical/clinical stages. This study is based on designing of polypeptide vaccines (PVs) against human malaria that cover almost all stages of life cycle of Plasmodium and for the same 5 genome derived predicted antigenic proteins (GDPAP) have been used. For the development of a multi-immune inducer, 15 PVs were initially designed using T cell epitope ensemble which covered >99% human population as well as linear B cell epitopes with or without adjuvants. The immune simulation of PVs showed higher levels of T-cell and B-cell activities compared to positive and negative vaccine controls. Furthermore, in silico cloning of PVs and codon optimization followed by enhanced expression within Lactococcus lactis host system was also explored. Although, the study has sound theoretical and in silico findings, the in vitro/in vivo evaluation seems imperative to warrant the immunogenicity and safety of PVs towards management of P. falciparum infection in the future.","Pritam, Manisha; Singh, Garima; Swaroop, Suchit; Singh, Akhilesh Kumar; Pandey, Brijesh; Singh, Satarudra Prakash",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.191,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.191,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.191,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1172,Rapid surveillance of COVID-19 in the United States using a prospective space-time scan statistic: Detecting and evaluating emerging clusters,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a pandemic with an estimated death rate between 1% and 5%; and an estimated R 0 between 2.2 and 6.7 according to various sources. As of March 28th, 2020, there were over 649,000 confirmed cases and 30,249 total deaths, globally. In the United States, there were over 115,500 cases and 1891 deaths and this number is likely to increase rapidly. It is critical to detect clusters of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve decision-making as the outbreaks continue to grow. Using daily case data at the county level provided by Johns Hopkins University, we conducted a prospective spatial-temporal analysis with SaTScan. We detect statistically significant space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. between January 22nd-March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd-March 27th, 2020. The space-time prospective scan statistic detected “active” and emerging clusters that are present at the end of our study periods – notably, 18 more clusters were detected when adding the updated case data. These timely results can inform public health officials and decision makers about where to improve the allocation of resources, testing sites; also, where to implement stricter quarantines and travel bans. As more data becomes available, the statistic can be rerun to support timely surveillance of COVID-19, demonstrated here.

It is highly pathogenic and reproduces quickly. There are currently no specific drugs to prevent the reproduction and spread of COVID-19. Some traditional Chinese medicines, especially the Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (Qing Fei Pai Du Tang), have shown therapeutic effects on mild and ordinary COVID-19 patients. Polysaccharides are important ingredients in this decoction. This review summarizes the potential pharmacological activities of polysaccharides isolated by hot water extraction from Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction, which is consistent with its production method, to provide the theoretical basis for ongoing research on its application.","Cao, Peng; Wu, Sanlan; Wu, Tingting; Deng, Yahui; Zhang, Qilin; Wang, Kaiping; Zhang, Yu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116346,Elsevier,10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116346,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1174,Association of Cardiovascular Disease with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Severity: A Meta-Analysis,"Abstract Observational studies have reported an association between underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients, but this still remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of recent studies that reported the association of CVD with worse prognosis and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Literature search through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase was completed by 2 reviewers from November 1, 2019 to April 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were observational case-control or cohort studies on COVID-19 patients with a history of CVD included, which reported outcomes of COVID-19 infection severity, clearly outlined the definition of “severe disease” and with sample size >10. Data were abstracted independently by 2 authors. Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe) and mortality (non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. A total of 18 studies (n= 4,858 patients) were included. Sixteen studies were from China, while 2 were from the United States. Pre-existing CVD was associated with a significantly increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 (OR= 3.14; 95% CI 2.32-4.24; I2=0%; Q= 8.68, p=0.73) and overall risk of COVID-19 all-cause mortality (OR= 11.08; 95% CI: 2.59-47.32; I2=55%; p=0.11). However, this study did not find a significant association between previous history of CVD and mortality in severe COVID-19 disease (OR=1.72; 95% CI: 0.97-3.06, I2=0%, p=0.46). Pre-existing CVD is associated with worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. Clinicians and policymakers need to take account of these findings in implementing risk stratification models.","Aggarwal, Gaurav; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Aggarwal, Saurabh; Wong, Johnny; Lippi, Giuseppe; Lavie, Carl J.; Henry, Brandon M.; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100617,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100617,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100617,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
1175,COVID-19 and Multi-Organ Response,"Abstract Since the outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 starting late December 2019, it has been apparent that disease prognosis has largely been influenced by multi-organ involvement. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on body-wide organs via ACE2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multi-organ failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. This paper aims to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19, encapsulating its multi-organ impact.","Zaim, Sevim; Chong, Jun Heng; Sankaranarayanan, Vissagan; Harky, Amer",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100618,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100618,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100618,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

1185,Innovations in HIV-1 Vaccine Design,"Abstract Purpose The field of HIV-1 vaccinology has evolved during the last 30 years from the first viral vector HIV gene insert constructs to vaccination regimens using a myriad of strategies. These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward. Methods We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. Findings The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials. Implications Rapid developments in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies suggest that a tolerable and effective HIV vaccine may be on the horizon.","Jones, Letitia D.; Moody, M.

1188,Association between clinical manifestations and prognosis in patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to find out risk factors associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and clinical outcome among patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study. A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled. The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was PCR detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). Clinical, laboratory, and radiological results as well as treatment outcome data were obtained. ARDS was defined as oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) ≤ 300mmHg. Findings Multivariate analysis showed that older age (OR=1.078, P=0.008) and high BMI (OR=1.327, P=0.024) were independent risk factor associated with patients with pneumonia. For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (SBP) level (OR=1.046, P=0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR=1.010, P=0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS. A total of 70 patients were conducted CT scan repeatedly after treatment. Patients were divided in disease exacerbation group (n=19) and disease relieve group (n=51). High BMI (OR=1.285, P=0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR=16.13, P=0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment. Implications Our results help to risk stratification in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression.","Yu, Tao; Cai, Shaohang; Zheng, Zhidan; Cai, Xuejuan; Liu, Yuanyuan; Yin, Sichun; Peng, Jie; Xu, Xuwen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.04.009,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

1192,"Emergency mental health legislation in response to the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic in Ireland: Urgency, necessity and proportionality","Abstract Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus). In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur ‘in person’, ‘by other appropriate means’, or even, ‘due to the exigencies of the public health emergency’, not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that ‘the exigencies of the public health emergency’ might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist ‘no earlier than the day before’ the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals ‘consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor’. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise ‘necessary in the interest of the patient’. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days ‘of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary’. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide ‘a written statement’ rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.","Kelly, Brendan D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1193,Future Perspectives of Wastewater-Based Epidemiology: Monitoring Infectious Disease Spread and Resistance to the Community Level,"Abstract Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.","Sims, Natalie; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,Elsevier,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
1194,Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: the world should face the reality,"Abstract Hand washing and maintaining social distance are the main measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to avoid contracting COVID-19. Unfortunately, these measured do not prevent infection by inhalation of small droplets exhaled by an infected person that can travel distance of meters or tens of meters in the air and carry their viral content. Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.","Morawska, Lidia; Cao, Junji",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105730,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105730,Elsevier,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105730,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

Methods Large entities that support chiropractic education or practice were invited to participate in this report. Leaders of various entities were emailed an invitation. A designee who was assigned by the leader provided a brief synopsis of actions the entity had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only entities that responded are included in this report. Results Five entities agreed to participate: The Council on Chiropractic Education, Association of Chiropractic Colleges, Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and the NCMIC. Common themes included (1) recognizing the crisis and taking action; (2) establishing a safe working environment for staff so that services could continue; (3) delivering communications to stakeholders (chiropractic students, practitioners, licensing boards, and others) to guide decisions and direct actions; and (4) continuing to monitor the situation and respond as new information becomes available. Conclusion These entities serve a large portion of the chiropractic profession. They have been quick to respond in a responsible, compassionate, and supportive manner to assist chiropractic licensing boards, practitioners, and students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1201,Clinical and computed tomographic imaging features of novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2,"Summary Purpose To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. Results Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. Conclusion CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","Xu, Yu-Huan; Dong, Jing-Hui; An, Wei-Min; Lv, Xiao-Yan; Yin, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Zeng; Dong, Li; Ma, Xi; Zhang, Hong-Jie; Gao, Bu-Lang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,25/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-25

Methods Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. Results 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3–8) vs. 28 (26–29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death. And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (HR 0.10, P < 0.001). Conclusions High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients. Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission. Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome. Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.","Wang, Lang; He, Wenbo; Yu, Xiaomei; Hu, Dalong; Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Huafen; Zhou, Jiali; Jiang, Hong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

1218,SAA is a biomarker to distinguish the severity and prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Abstract Background To explore the significance of SAA in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. Results COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. Conclusions SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Huan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Ren, Hongwei; Xu, Lingli; Zhao, Lisha; Chen, Xiaoqiong; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

Many infected clusters have been found within familial households, but the data about secondary transmission among household contacts is limited. Methods In this retrospective case series, we enrolled 85 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members in Wuhan. Patients were confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on throat swabs. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data of the household members were collected. Results There were 155 close contacts in total. 104 contacts received RT-PCR assays, with 47 (30%) positive cases and 57 (37%) negative cases. 51 (33%) cases did not received RT-PCR tests for they showed no symptoms of pneumonia during the 2 weeks of quarantine. The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts. Conclusions The rate of secondary transmission among household contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 30%.

1224,Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Objective To better inform efforts to treat and control the current outbreak with a comprehensive characterization of COVID-19. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI (Chinese Database) for studies published as of March 2, 2020, and we searched references of identified articles. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 . Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. Results 43 studies involving 3600 patients were included. Among COVID-19 patients, fever (83.3% [95% CI 78.4–87.7]), cough (60.3% [54.2–66.3]), and fatigue (38.0% [29.8–46.5]) were the most common clinical symptoms. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (68.6% [58.2–78.2]), decreased lymphocyte count (57.4% [44.8–69.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4–71.6]). Ground-glass opacities (80.0% [67.3–90.4]) and bilateral pneumonia (73.2% [63.4–82.1]) were the most frequently reported findings on computed tomography. The overall estimated proportion of severe cases and case-fatality rate (CFR) was 25.6% (17.4–34.9) and 3.6% (1.1–7.2), respectively. CFR and laboratory abnormalities were higher in severe cases, patients from Wuhan, and older patients, but CFR did not differ by gender. Conclusions The majority of COVID-19 cases are symptomatic with a moderate CFR.

1234,The profile of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in children with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"Abstract Objectives The study was aimed at investigating the characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia. Methods Children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia or with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia were included. Data including lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines were collected and analyzed. Results : 56 patients were included in the study, 40 children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and 16 children with RSV pneumonia. Compared with children with RSV pneumonia, patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia had higher count of CD3+8+ lymphocyte, higher percentages of CD3+, CD3+8+ lymphocytes and a lower percentage of CD19+ lymphocyte. The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in children with RSV pneumonia. One 2019-nCoV pneumonia child who was with an obvious increase of IL-10 developed severe pneumonia. Conclusions Immune response played a very important role in the development of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The effective CD8+ T cell response might influence the severity of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The adaptable change in IL-10 level might contribute to the relatively mild pneumonia symptoms in children with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and bacterial co-infection might be a risk factor of severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","Li, Hui; Chen, Kailan; Liu, Maochang; Xu, Hua; Xu, Qiong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.001,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1235,"CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia at admission in Wuhan, China","Abstract Purpose Aimed to characterize the CT imaging and clinical course of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed. Results 58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cohort was ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) with peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) and mostly involving one or two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied by characteristic signs. After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue. The evolution of lesions on CT imaging were observed in 10 patients (17.2%). The average days of hospitalization was19.80±10.82 days, and was significantly longer in progression patients (28.60±7.55 day). Conclusion CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has definite characteristics. Since asymptomatic infections as “covert transmitter”, and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term. It is essential to pay attention to the surveillance of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. CT scan has great value in screening and detecting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the highly suspicious, asymptomatic cases with negative nucleic acid testing.","Meng, Heng; Xiong, Rui; He, Ruyuan; Lin, Weichen; Hao, Bo; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Zilong; Shen, Xiaokang; Fan, Tao; Jiang, Wenyang; Yang, Wenbin; Li, Tao; Chen, Jun; Qing, Geng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.004,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12
1236,Clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women suspected of coronavirus disease 2019,"Summary Background 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly. Objective This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19. Methods The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition). Results There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p>0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p>0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p<0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive. Conclusion The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women. Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection.","yang, Hui; Sun, Guoqiang; Tang, Fei; Peng, Min; Gao, Ying; Peng, Jing; Xie, Hui; Zhao, Yun; Jin, Zhichun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.003,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

1241,The epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and lessons from this global infectious public health event,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a potentially fatal disease of great global public health importance. As of March 26, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 462,801 confirmed cases and 20,839 deaths globally, which is more than those caused by SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2013, respectively. The epidemic has posed considerable challenges worldwide. Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus; however, the global situation remains serious. Additionally, the origin of COVID-19 has not been determined and no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently available. Based on the published data, this review systematically discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and current intervention measures related to COVID-19 in the hope that it may provide a reference for future studies and aid in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Tu, Huilan; Tu, Sheng; Gao, Shiqi; Shao, Anwen; Sheng, Jifang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.011,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1242,"Suppressed T cell-mediated immunity in patients with COVID-19: a clinical retrospective study in Wuhan, China","Abstract Importance An ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world. We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported. For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge= 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death=28). All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values. The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively. As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients. Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (<500), CD3+T-cell (<200), CD4+ T-cell (<100), CD8+ T-cell (<100) and B-cell (<50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19. The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively. Conclusion We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness. The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.","XU, Bo; FAN, Cun-yu; WANG, An-lu; ZOU, Yi-long; YU, Yi-han; HE, Cong; XIA, Wen-guang; ZHANG, Ji-xian; MIAO, Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.012,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases. Method We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families. Result Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (>30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.","Song, Rui; Han, Bing; Song, Meihua; Wang, Lin; Conlon, Christopher P.; Dong, Tao; Tian, Di; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Zhihai; Zhang, Fujie; Shi, Mang; Li, Xingwang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.018,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

Methods We identified seven cases of COVID-19 who was readmitted to hospital because of positive RT-PCR after discharge, including three pediatrics and four young adult patients. Results Six patients had positive rectal swabs but negative throat swabs, and one patient had positive throat swabs. All the patients continued to be asymptomatic and had unchanged chest computed tomography from previous images. The time from hospital discharge to positive RT-PCR after recovery was 7–11 days. The time from positive to negative rectal swabs was 5-23 days. Conclusion The study might suggest the positive RT-PCR after recovery did not mean disease relapse or virus reinfection.

1252,The role of community-wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic due to SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract Background Face mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial. We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Methods Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per-million-population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. Findings Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per-million-population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared to only 3 in workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit). Conclusion Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing virus shedding in saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.","Cheng, Vincent C.C.; Wong, Shuk-Ching; Chuang, Vivien W.M.; So, Simon Y.C.; Chen, Jonathan H.K.; Sridhar, Siddharth; To, Kelvin K.W.; Chan, Jasper F.W.; Hung, Ivan F.N.; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.024,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

1254,How is immunosuppressive status affecting children and adults in SARS-CoV-2 infection? A systematic review,"Abstract Objectives SARS-CoV-2 infection has now a global resonance. Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few. With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population. Methods A systematic review of literature was carried out to identify relevant articles, searching the EMBASE, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. Studies reporting data on pre-defined outcomes and related to immunosuppressed adults and children with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Results Sixteen relevant articles were identified with 110 immunosuppressed patients, mostly presenting cancer, along with transplantation and immunodeficiency. Cancer was more often associated with a more severe course, but not necessarily with a bad prognosis. Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population. Conclusion Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities. This might be explained by a hypothetical protective role of a weaker immune response, determining a milder disease presentation and thus underdiagnosis. Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged.","Minotti, Chiara; Tirelli, Francesca; Barbieri, Elisa; Giaquinto, Carlo; Donà, Daniele",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.026,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

1258,Clinical and Transmission Dynamics Characteristics of 406 Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China: A Review,"Abstract Objective Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19. They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. Methods By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. Results It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. Conclusion There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.","Zhen-Dong, Yang; Gao-Jun, Zhou; Run-Ming, Jin; Zhi-Sheng, Liu; Zong-Qi, Dong; Xiong, Xie; Guo-Wei, Song",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.030,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Specific demands of the local street population in times of coronavirus – a concern of social psychiatry","Abstract Background Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation Results With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and “extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs”, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are “incredibly vulnerable to this virus”. Conclusions Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently.

1270,PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS: THEIR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO COVID-19,"Abstract Background : Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11
1271,When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak,"Abstract Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects.

There were no significant differences between males and females. Those who were of over 50 years old, had an undergraduate education and below, were divorced or widowed, and agricultural workers had significantly more symptoms. However, significantly more minors and medical staff were in the high-risk group. These results show that COVID-19 has a significant adverse socio-psychological influence on ordinary citizens.

1274,Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health,"Abstract Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.","Araújo, Francisco Jonathan de Oliveira; de Lima, Ligia Samara Abrantes; Cidade, Pedro Ivo Martins; Nobre, Camila Bezerra; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

1278,A CRISIS WITHIN THE CRISIS: THE MENTAL HEALTH SITUATION OF REFUGEES IN THE WORLD DURING THE 2019 CORONAVIRUS (2019-nCoV) OUTBREAK,"Abstract Background 68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection. Conclusions There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations.","Júnior, Jucier Gonçalves; de Sales, Jair Paulino; Moreira, Marcial Moreno; Pinheiro, Woneska Rodrigues; Lima, Carlos Kennedy Tavares; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113000,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113000,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113000,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

The mental health response to the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks, culminating in a federally-funded health program, provides a template for how providers may serve affected individuals. Drawing on the 9/11 experience, we highlight effective prevention measures, likely short and long-term treatment needs, vulnerable subgroups, and important points of divergence between 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this paper we develop a dynamic model of debt runs based on He and Xiong (2012) to identify, both conceptually and quantitatively, the value of a liquidity backstop for its run-mitigating role. For the purpose of identification, we focus on the municipal bond markets for variable rate demand obligations and auction rate securities. Based on the run episodes in these markets during the financial crisis of 2007-09 and the calibrated model, we find that the value of a liquidity backstop is about 14.5 basis points per annum. Our findings have important policy implications regarding the effectiveness of liquidity backstops in ameliorating problems of financial instability.","Wei, Bin; Yue, Vivian Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103916,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103916,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103916,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
1283,Immune response and onset of protection from Bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 infection induced by modified-live virus vaccination concurrent with injectable trace minerals administration in newly received beef calves,"Abstract Strategies to improve the onset of protective immunity induced by vaccination against respiratory pathogens may have a significant impact on health of newly received beef calves. The objective was to determine if the use of injectable trace minerals (ITM; Se, Zn, Cu, and Mn) concurrent with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine enhances the immune response and onset of protection in beef calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after vaccination. Forty-five calves were randomly assigned to one of three groups (15/group): VAC + ITM, received MLV-vaccine and ITM (Multimin®90) subcutaneously (SC); VAC + SAL, received the same vaccine and saline SC; or UNVAC, unvaccinated. Five days after vaccination (d.0), calves were challenged with BVDV2 strain 890. Health status was evaluated and blood samples were collected for leukocyte counts, BVDV1 and 2 serum neutralizing antibody (SNA), BVDV-PCR, percentage of CD4+, CD8+, WC1+ and CD25+ T-cells. VAC + ITM had lower health scores than UNVAC (d.8 and 9). VAC + ITM had higher BVDV1 & 2 SNA titers than VAC + SAL and UNVAC on d.21 and 28. Lymphocyte counts decreased in UNVAC but not in VAC + ITM or VAC + SAL (d.3 to 11). CD4+ T-cells significantly decreased in UNVAC and VAC + SAL (d.3). VAC + ITM had higher percentage of CD4+ cells than UNVAC (d.3 and 7). VAC + ITM had lower percentage of activated CD4+ and CD8+ than UNVAC (d.7). In summary, vaccination induced a rapid protection against BVDV2 infection. Administration of ITM was associated with increased SNA response to BVDV1 & 2, enhanced health status, mitigation of CD4+ T-cells decreased, and reduction of T-cell activation in calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after immunization. These results support the strategic use of ITM concurrent with vaccination, especially when a rapid protection is needed in newly received beef calves.","Bittar, João H.J.; Palomares, Roberto A.; Hurley, David J.; Hoyos-Jaramillo, Alejandro; Rodriguez, Adriana; Stoskute, Agne; Hamrick, Brianna; Norton, Natalie; Adkins, Morgan; Saliki, Jeremiah T.; Sanchez, Susan; Lauber, Kelsey",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2020.110055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2020.110055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vetimm.2020.110055,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
1284,Respiratory viral panels and pediatric airway evaluation: the role of testing for upper respiratory infections to stratify perioperative risk,"Abstract Objectives Children admitted with stridor and respiratory distress comprise a complex patient group that requires the otolaryngologist to decide when to assess and intervene with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB). Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. Conclusions Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","Niermeyer, Weston L.; Ball, Jessica; Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda; Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110057,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

We offer detailed perioperative management strategies and present a specific protocol designed to improve safety during pediatric laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Several methods of using disposable drapes for various procedures are described, with the goal of constructing a tent around the patient to decrease widespread contamination of dispersed droplets and generated aerosol. The concepts presented herein are translatable to future situations where aerosol generating procedures increase risk for any pathogenic exposure.

1287,Emerging New Concepts of Degrader Technologies,"Abstract The traditional drug discovery focuses on identifying direct inhibitors of target proteins. This approach typically relies on a specific measurable biochemical readout and amenable binding sites of which the occupancy directly influences the target protein’s function. These requirements preclude many disease-causing proteins from being “druggable” targets, and these proteins are categorized as “undruggable”. The proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology provides powerful tools to degrade these “undruggable” targets and has become a promising approach for drug discovery. However, the PROTAC technology may have limitations and emerging new degrader technologies may greatly broaden the spectrum of targets that could be selectively degraded by harnessing another major degradation pathway in cells. Here we review a few key emerging technologies that exploit the lysosomal degradation pathway and discuss their potential applications as well as limitations.","Ding, Yu; Fei, Yiyan; Lu, Boxun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tips.2020.04.005,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

1289,"Transitions in brain evolution: space, time and entropy","Abstract How did brains evolve to become so complex, and what is their future? Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures – organisms – which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms’ reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multi-dimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase. Brain evolution enabled representation of space and time, which vastly enhances this process. Some of these channels lead to tiny, dead-ends in the state space: the persistence of complex life is thus not thermodynamically guaranteed.","Jeffery, Kate J.; Rovelli, Carlo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tins.2020.04.008,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

The M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel that is required for virus replication and is an established antiviral target. While licensed adamantane-based M2 antivirals have been historically used, M2 mutations that confer major adamantane resistance are now so prevalent in circulating virus strains that these drugs are no longer recommended. Here we review the current understanding of IAV M2 structure and function, mechanisms of inhibition, the rise of drug resistance mutations, and ongoing efforts to develop new antivirals that target resistant forms of M2.","Jalily, Pouria H.; Duncan, Maggie C.; Fedida, David; Wang, Jun; Tietjen, Ian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,Elsevier,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27

1294,Remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2: structural requirements at both nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 Exonuclease active-sites,"Abstract The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for antivirals. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","Shannon, Ashleigh; Tuyet Le, Nhung Thi; Selisko, Barbara; Eydoux, Cecilia; Alvarez, Karine; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne; Peersen, Olve; Ferron, Francois; Canard, Bruno",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793,Elsevier,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1296,Antiviral Activities of Type I Interferons to SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Abstract There is an urgent need to identify antivirals to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant human interferons α and β (IFNα/β). Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-β at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells. The EC50 of IFN-α and IFN-β treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.","Mantlo, Emily; Bukreyeva, Natalya; Maruyama, Junki; Paessler, Slobodan; Huang, Cheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811,Elsevier,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1297,Unhappiness and Age,"Abstract I examine the relationship between unhappiness and age using data from eight well-being data files on nearly fourteen million respondents across forty European countries and the United States and 168 countries from the Gallup World Poll. I use twenty different individual characterizations of unhappiness including many not good mental health days; anxiety; worry; loneliness; sadness; stress; pain; strain, depression and bad nerves; phobias and panic; being downhearted; having restless sleep; losing confidence in oneself; not being able to overcome difficulties; being under strain; being unhappy; feeling a failure; feeling left out; feeling tense; and thinking of yourself as a worthless person. I also analyze responses to a further general attitudinal measure regarding whether the situation in the respondent's country is getting worse. Responses to all these unhappiness questions show a, ceteris paribus, hill shape in age, with controls and many also do so with limited controls for time and country. Unhappiness is hill-shaped in age and the average age where the maximum occurs is 49 with or without controls. There is an unhappiness curve.","Blanchflower, David G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2020.04.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2020.04.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jebo.2020.04.022,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1299,"Suspected myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19: Evidence from front-line clinical observation in Wuhan, China","Abstract Background A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community. Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. Methods We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. Results 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Conclusions The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.","Deng, Qing; Hu, Bo; Zhang, Yao; Wang, Hao; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Hu, Wei; Cheng, Yuting; Yan, Jie; Ping, Haiqin; Zhou, Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

1303,The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on congenital heart disease,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.","Tan, Weiyi; Aboulhosn, Jamil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,15/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-15

To illustrate its salience and possible applications, the paper calibrates and presents L-RaG values using country data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). Among other things, the author demonstrates that when properly benchmarked, the longevity-risk-adjusted global age of a 55-year-old Swedish male is 48, whereas a 55-year-old Russian male is closer in age to 67. The paper also discusses the connection between the proposed L-RaG age and the related concept of Biological age, from the medical and gerontology literature. Practically speaking, in a world of growing mortality heterogeneity, the L-RaG age could be used for pension and retirement policy. In the language of behavioral finance and economics, a salient metric that adjusts chronological age for longevity risk might help capture the public’s attention, educate them about lifetime uncertainty and induce many of them to take action — such as working longer and/or retiring later.","Milevsky, Moshe A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.insmatheco.2020.03.009,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
1306,A network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems,"Abstract In data science, networks provide a useful abstraction of the structure of many complex systems, ranging from social systems and computer networks to biological networks and physical systems. Healthcare service systems are one of the main social systems that can also be understood using network-based approaches, for example, to identify and evaluate influential providers. In this paper, we propose a network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems. First, the provider-interacting network is constructed by employing publicly available information on locations and types of healthcare services of providers. Second, the ranking of nodes in the generated provider-interacting network is conducted in parallel on the basis of four nodal influence metrics. Third, the impact of the top-ranked influential nodes in the provider-interacting network is evaluated using three indicators. Compared with other research work based on patient-sharing networks, in this paper, the provider-interacting network of healthcare service providers can be roughly created according to the locations and the publicly available types of healthcare services, without the need for personally private electronic medical claims, thus protecting the privacy of patients. The proposed method is demonstrated by employing Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2017, and can be applied to other similar datasets to help make decisions for the optimization of healthcare resources in the response to public health emergencies.","Qi, Xiaoyu; Mei, Gang; Cuomo, Salvatore; Xiao, Lei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

They are responsible for numerous cases of hospitalization, many deaths, and widespread crop destruction, which all result in an enormous medical, economical, and biological burden. Each of the currently used decontamination methods have important drawbacks. Cold plasma has entered this field as a novel, efficient, and clean solution for virus inactivation. Here, we present the recent developments in this promising field of cold-plasma-mediated virus inactivation, and describe the applications and mechanisms of the inactivation.

It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

1309,Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: perspectives from the radiation oncology service in singapore,"Abstract In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO. The outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it was named ‘COVID-19’. The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23rd January 2020. With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak. The government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission. Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the disease. There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an infectious disease outbreak. This article is the recommendations and adapted workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, Singapore. It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses.

1316,A rapid review of evidence and recommendations from the SIOPE Radiation Oncology working group to help mitigate for reduced paediatric radiotherapy capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic or other crises,"Abstract Objective To derive evidence-based recommendations for the optimal utilisation of resources during unexpected shortage of radiotherapy capacity. Methods and materials We have undertaken a rapid review of published literature on the role of radiotherapy in the multimodality treatment of paediatric cancers governing the European practice of paediatric radiotherapy. The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations. Results The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis. The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed. Conclusion This review provides evidence-based treatment recommendations during unexpected shortage of paediatric radiotherapy facilities. It has wider applications for the optimal utilization of facilities, to improve clinical outcome in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources continue to be a challenge.","Janssens, Geert O.; Mandeville, Henry C.; Timmermann, Beate; Maduro, John H.; Alapetite, Claire; Padovani, Laetitia; Horan, Gail; Lassen-Ramshad, Yasmin; Dieckmann, Karin; Ruebe, Christian; Thorp, Nicky; Gandola, Lorenza; Ajithkumar, Thankamma; Boterberg, Tom",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.035,Elsevier,10.1016/j.radonc.2020.04.035,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

Because of its unique ability for the detection of sub-clonal variants within genetically diverse populations, NGS has been successfully applied to analyze and quantify the exceptionally-high diversity within viral quasispecies, and many low-frequency drug- or vaccine-resistant mutations of therapeutic importance have been discovered. Although many works have intensively discussed the latest NGS approaches and applications in general, none of them has focused on applying NGS in viral quasispecies studies, mostly due to the limited ability of current NGS technologies to accurately detect and quantify rare viral variants. Here, we summarize several error-correction strategies that have been developed to enhance the detection accuracy of minority variants. We also discuss critical considerations for preparing a sequencing library from viral RNAs and for analyzing NGS data to unravel the mutational landscape.","Lu, I-Na; Muller, Claude P.; He, Feng Q.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197963,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197963,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197963,02/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-02
1320,"Characterization, Pathogenicity and Protective efficacy of a Cell Culture-Derived Porcine Deltacoronavirus","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses to the pig industry. However, there is currently little information on vaccine studies and commercially available vaccines for PDCoV. Hence, herein, a PDCoV strain, CH/XJYN/2016, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in vitro, and its biological characteristics were determined. Compared to that of previously reported and recently isolated PDCoV strains from China and the United States, the S gene of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain contains novel mutations. Infection studies revealed that CH/XJYN/2016 is pathogenic to suckling piglets and conventional weaned pigs. In addition, the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of PDCoV in conventional weaned pigs was determined (2.0 log10PDD50/3 mL). Furthermore, an inactivated cell-adapted CH/XJYN/2016-based vaccine candidate was developed with different adjuvants. Compared with nonvaccinated pigs, conventional weaned pigs given the inactivated vaccine developed a potent humoral immune response and showed no clinical signs or viral shedding after challenge, indicating a potent protective effect of the vaccine against PDCoV infection. Therefore, the PDCoV vaccine developed in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be used for the control of PDCoV infection in pigs.","Gao, Xiang; Zhao, Donghong; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Liping; Li, Mingxia; Li, Weiyan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu; Liu, Xinsheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02
1321,Involvement of VCP/UFD1/Nucleolin in the viral entry of Enterovirus A species,"Abstract Valosin-containing protein (VCP) plays roles in various cellular activities. Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71.

In order to gain insight into the emergence, evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, a comprehensive analysis of genome composition and codon usage of βCoV circulating in China was performed. A biased nucleotide composition was found for SARS-CoV-2 genome. This bias in genomic composition is reflected in its codon and amino acid usage patterns. The overall codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased. Most of the highly frequent codons are A- and U-ending, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is the main force shaping codon usage in this virus. Significant differences in relative synonymous codon usage frequencies among SARS-CoV-2 and human cells were found. These differences are due to codon usage preferences.","Tort, Fernando L.; Castells, Matías; Cristina, Juan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197976,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197976,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197976,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

1327,COVID-19 and Diabetes: Knowledge in Progress,"Abstract Aims We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management. Methods We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. Results The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes. Conclusions Suggestions are made on the possible pathological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.","Hussain, Akhtar; Bhowmik, Bishwajit; Cristina do Vale Moreira, Nayla",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108142,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108142,Elsevier,10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108142,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

1339,A Conceptual Framework to Untangle the Concept of Urban Ecosystem Services,"Abstract Urban ecosystem service (UES) is becoming an influential concept to guide the planning, design, and management of urban landscapes towards urban sustainability. However, its use is hindered by definitional ambiguity, and the conceptual bases underpinning its application remain weak. This is exemplified by two different but equally valid interpretations of UES: “urban ecosystem services”, referring to ecosystem services from analogs of natural and semi-natural ecosystems within urban boundaries, and “urban ecosystem services”, a much broader term that includes the former group as well as urban services in a city. While we recognize that a single definition of UES is not possible nor necessary as its application is context-dependent, it is nevertheless useful to clarify the relationships between these interpretations to promote consistent use, and importantly, explore how a broader interpretation of UES might advance its applications in areas that have been neglected. We developed a conceptual framework that links UES to natural and human-derived capital to explain the relationships between the dual meanings of UES and proposed three normative propositions to guide its application: (1) integrate holistically multiple components of natural capital to provide UES, (2) reduce dependence on non-renewable abiotic resources and human-derived capital, and (3) enhance UES through technology. The framework we developed helps to resolve the current ambiguity in the meanings of UES, highlights the need to recognise neglected aspects of natural capital important for UES, and can be used to clarify relationships with related concepts conveying dependence of human well-being on nature.","Yok tan, Puay; Zhang, Jingyuan; Masoudi, Mahyar; Berhane Alemu, Jahson; Edwards, Peter J.; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne; Richards, Daniel R.; Saunders, Justine; Ping Song, Xiao; Wei Wong, Lynn",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103837,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103837,Elsevier,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103837,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

1347,Practical Strategies Against the Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19—the Imminent Global Threat,"The last month of 2019 harbingered the emergence of a viral outbreak that is now a major public threat globally. COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally. Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched. In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems—for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases—are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19. Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
1348,Can Bioactive Lipids Inactivate Coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS are all enveloped viruses that can cause acute respiratory syndrome. Arachidonic acid (AA) and other unsaturated fatty acids (especially eicosapentaenoic acd, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA) are known to inactivate enveloped viruses and inhibit proliferation of various microbial organisms. The pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA and EPA such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes induce inflammation whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and augment phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load. In view of these actions, it is suggested that AA and other unsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds and their deficiency may render humans susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS and other similar viruses’ infections. Hence, oral or intravenous administration of AA and other unsaturated fatty acids may aid in enhancing resistance and recovery from SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS infections.","Das, Undurti N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27

World Health Organization has even declared that it is a global health emergency. The simplest method to limit the spread of this new virus and for people to protect themselves as well as the others is to wear a mask in crowded places. The sudden increase demand on face mask has caused manufacturers the inability to not provide enough products in a short time and the situation properly will stay the same for a period of time. In this article, we aim to give an idea on how to save the number of face masks used but still provides the same protective values using a Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mask and a common surgical facemask.","Luan, Phan Thien; Tak-Shing Ching, Congo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.001,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
1350,Is the ACE2 Overexpression a Risk Factor for COVID-19 Infection?,"In the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, a higher proportion of patients with severe disease were found in older persons with comorbidities.

So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease. As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α) through different routes. Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.015,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1353,Ongoing Challenges Faced in the Global Control of COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020. As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.","Perez Perez, Guillermo I.; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.016,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.016,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

Bioactive lipids with an array of known health-promoting properties can be suggested as effective agents in alleviating acute respiratory stress induced by virus. The bioactive lipid amide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), due to several distinctive homeostatic properties, including anti-inflammatory activities, modulation of immune response, and anti-oxidant effects can be considered as a novel potential pharmacological alternative for the management of COVID-19.","Ghaffari, Samad; Roshanravan, Neda; Tutunchi, Helda; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Pouraghaei, Mahboub; Kafil, Behnam",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.006,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1356,"Comparative Global Epidemiological Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Diseases Using Meta-MUMS Tool Through Incidence, Mortality, and Recovery Rates","COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was reported by the world health organization in late December 2019. As an unexplained respiratory disease epidemic, which is similar to respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV, it rapidly spread all over the world. The study aims to compare several parameters of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV infectious diseases in terms of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates. The publicly available dataset Worldometer (extracted on April 5, 2020) confirmed by WHO report was available for meta-analysis purposes using the Meta-MUMS tool. And, the reported outcomes of the analysis used a random-effects model to evaluate the event rate, and risk ratios thorough subgroup analysis forest plots. Seventeen countries for COVID-19 and eight countries of SARS infections, including COVID-19 group n = 1124243, and SARS-CoV group n = 8346, were analyzed. In this meta-analysis, a random effect model of relations of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates of COVID-19 and SARS world infections were determined. The meta-analysis and forest plots of two viral world infections showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 infection is more than SARS infections, while recovery and mortality event rates of SARS-CoV are more than COVID-19 infection. And subgroup analysis showed that the mortality and recovery rates were higher in both SARS-CoV wand COVID-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively. In conclusion, the meta-analysis approach on the abovementioned dataset revealed the epidemiological and statistical analyses for comparing COVID-19 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.","Sokouti, Massoud; Sadeghi, Ramin; Pashazadeh, Saeid; Eslami, Saeid; Sokouti, Mohsen; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Sokouti, Babak",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.005,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1359,Tackling the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract After the initial breakout of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)—in Wuhan, China—and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes remain unanswered but fast explored. More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreak. Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.","Rahimi, Farid; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

1361,COVID-19 and Moral Imperialism in Multinational Clinical Research,"Abstract A TV debate in April 2020 between two French doctors regarding the benefits of testing a coronavirus vaccine in Africa where there are no masks or treatments available has led to international criticism. This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment). Underlying this ethical double standard in some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected.","Hellmann, Fernando; Williams-Jones, Bryn; Garrafa, Volnei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.017,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1372,Racial Differences in Time to Treatment for Melanoma,"Abstract Background Longer time from diagnosis to definitive surgery (TTDS) is associated with increased melanoma-specific mortality. Although Black patients present with later stage melanoma and have worse survival than non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients, the association between race and TTDS is unknown. Objective To investigate racial differences in time to melanoma treatment. Methods Retrospective review of the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with TTDS controlling for sociodemographic/disease characteristics. Results Of the 233,982 melanoma patients identified, 1,221 (0.52%) were Black. Black patients had longer TTDS for stage I-III melanoma (p<0.001) and time to immunotherapy (p=0.01), but not for TTDS for stage IV melanoma or time to chemotherapy (p>0.05 for both). Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, Black patients had over twice the odds of having TTDS between 41-60 days, over three times the odds of having TTDS between 61-90 days, and over five times the odds of having TTDS over 90 days. Racial differences in TTDS persisted within each insurance type. Patients with Medicaid had the longest TTDS (mean 60.4 days), and those with private insurance had the shortest TTDS (mean 44.6 days; p<0.001 for both). Conclusions Targeted approaches to improve TTDS for Black patients are integral in reducing racial disparities in melanoma outcomes.","Tripathi, Raghav; Archibald, Laura K.; Mazmudar, Rishabh S.; Conic, Rosalynn RZ.; Rothermel, Luke D.; Scott, Jeffrey F.; Bordeaux, Jeremy S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

1412,"Antimicrobial resistance in southern China: results of prospective surveillance in Dongguan city, 2017","SUMMARY Background Few studies have estimated the burden of infections due to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens in China. Aim To summarize antimicrobial resistance and assess the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China. Methods Seven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017, from which ‘bug–drug’ combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HCAI, data from three tertiary care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. Findings A total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Non-susceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 29.5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were non-susceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HCAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GCs and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.11) per 1000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively). Conclusion The incidence of non-susceptible bug–drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug–drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HCAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in Dongguan City was higher compared with Europe.","Wang, J.; Zhou, M.; Huang, G.; Guo, Z.; Sauser, J.; Metsini, A.; Pittet, D.; Zingg, W.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1415,Risk of nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease 2019: an experience in a general ward setting in Hong Kong,"SUMMARY Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. Aim To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. Method Contacts were identified and risk categorized as ‘close’ or ‘casual’ for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Findings A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of ‘close contact’. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. Conclusion Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.","Wong, S.C.-Y.; Kwong, R.T.-S.; Wu, T.C.; Chan, J.W.M.; Chu, M.Y.; Lee, S.Y.; Wong, H.Y.; Lung, D.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

Methods Twenty cases who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 and had none of the known symptoms for this viral infection formed the test group for 2 full weeks. Their age ranged between 20 and 50 years to avoid any age-related hearing affection. Patients who had definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as those who had a history of hearing loss or a history of any known cause of hearing loss were excluded from the examined sample. TEOAEs amplitude was measured for all participants. Results The high frequency pure-tone thresholds as well as the TEOAE amplitudes were significantly worse in the test group.

It is to be expected that instrumentation in or through those areas will entail a higher risk of transmission. That's why head and neck and otolaryngologist surgeons are among the most vulnerable health professionals. Observations Surgeons should essentially perform procedures they require. Surgeries should be performed with personal protective equipment suitable for the high risk of aerosolization: goggles, N95 face mask, facial mask, blood-repelling gown and gloves. It is advisable to have the cooperative COVID-19 test in all patients. Telemedicine is a useful resource if resources allow it. Conclusions and relevance Otolaryngologists and related specialists are among the groups at higher risk when performing surgeries and upper airway examinations. There are no emergencies in a pandemic. The care of health professionals is crucial to combating this health situation.","Boccalatte, L.A.; Larrañaga, J.J.; Perez Raffo, G.M.; Teijido, C.A.; García Fornari, G.; Staneloni, M.I.; Figari, M.F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102484,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102484,Elsevier,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102484,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1435,Embracing telemedicine into your otolaryngology practice amid the COVID-19 crisis: An invited commentary,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly and radically altered how Otolaryngologists provide patient care in the outpatient setting. Continuity of care with established patients as well as establishment of a professional relationship with new patients is challenging during this Public Health Emergency (PHE). Many geographic areas are under “stay at home” or “shelter in place” directives from state and local governments to avoid COVID-19 exposure risks. Medicare has recently allowed “broad flexibilities to furnish services using remote communications technology to avoid exposure risks to health care providers, patients, and the community.” [1] The implementation of telemedicine, or virtual, services, will help the Otolaryngologists provide needed care to patients while mitigating the clinical and financial impact of the pandemic. The significant coding and billing issues related to implementing telemedicine services are discussed to promote acceptance of this technology by the practicing Otolaryngologist. Of particular importance, outpatient visit Current Procedural Terminology® codes (99201-99215) may be used for telehealth visits performed in real-time audio and video.","Pollock, Kim; Setzen, Michael; Svider, Peter F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102490,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102490,Elsevier,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102490,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1436,COVID-19 and rhinology: A look at the future,"Abstract The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created a deadly pandemic that is now significantly impacting the United States. Otolaryngologists are considered high risk for contracting disease, as the virus resides in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. While valuable work has been publicized regarding several topics in Rhinology, we discuss other aspects of our specialty in further detail. There are several issues regarding Rhinologic practice that need to be clarified both for the current epidemic as well as for future expected “waves.” In addition, as the pandemic dies down, guidelines are needed to optimize safe practices as we start seeing more patients again. These include protocols pertinent to safety, in-office Rhinologic procedures, the substitution of imaging for endoscopy, and understanding the appropriate role of telemedicine. We discuss these aspects of Rhinology as well as practical concerns relating to telemedicine and billing, as these issues take on increasing importance for Rhinologists both in the present and the future.","Setzen, Michael; Svider, Peter F.; Pollock, Kim",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102491,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102491,Elsevier,10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102491,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1438,"Examining the inclusion of patients and their family members in infection prevention and control policies and guidelines across Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea","Background Although familial involvement during inpatient care is not uncommon in western countries, the types of caring activities that family members in Asian countries provide are significantly different. These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country). Methods The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines. Conclusions Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea.","Park, Ji Yeon; Pardosi, Jerico Franciscus; Seale, Holly",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,07/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-07
1439,To investigate the association between the health literacy and hand hygiene practices of the older adults to help them fight against infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"Background Proper hand hygiene helps prevent infectious diseases, while health literacy plays a critical role in preventive health behaviors. It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases. Methods A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire. Results The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants’ health literacy and their hand hygiene practices. Conclusions Health literacy and hand hygiene are positively related in helping the older adults fight against infectious diseases. To sustain proper hand hygiene practices is to provide frequent hand hygiene training to the older adults.","Or, Peggy Pui-Lai; Wong, Bonny Yee-Man; Chung, Joanne Wai-Yee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,07/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-07
1440,Viral and bacterial coinfection among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections,"Background The epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and local dominant etiologies of pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among central China children (≤14 years old) hospitalized are poorly understood. Methods A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Results It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs. Conclusions MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI. These findings will contribute to the effective prevention and therapeutic approaches of pathogens among local children suffering from RTI.","Liu, Junxiao; Wang, Mengli; Zhao, Zhihong; Lin, Xiao; Zhang, Pei; Yue, Qingfen; Zhang, Ting; Meng, Yujuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,26/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-26

Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Method Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from 20 January to 10 February 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","Sun, Niuniu; Shi, Suling; Jiao, Dandan; Song, Runluo; Ma, Lili; Wang, Hongwei; Wang, Chao; Wang, Zhaoguo; You, Yanli; Liu, Shuhua; Wang, Hongyun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

1451,Reducing antibiotic prescribing and addressing the global problem of antibiotic resistance by targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings: A Position Paper,"ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to threaten global health. Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of healthcare facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in healthcare settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies and healthcare professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.","Maillard, Jean-Yves; Bloomfield, Sally F.; Courvalin, Patrice; Essack, Sabiha Y.; Gandra, Sumanth; Gerba, Charles P.; Rubino, Joseph R.; Scott, Elizabeth A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.04.011,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

1458,Improving care for older adults in the Emergency Department warrants greater investment in geriatric nursing—Stat!,"Abstract Older adults use the Emergency Department (ED) more than any other age group besides infants. Despite high utilization, both the physical environment and care processes in the traditional ED are poorly suited to address the complex needs of older adults. As a result, older adults often experience poor outcomes in the ED. Geriatric nursing has been at the forefront of efforts to develop Geriatric Emergency Department Interventions (GEDI's) to try to address these deficits and improve care. As frontline providers with frequent patient contact, nursing brings critical viewpoints to these issues. This article provides some resources and other ideas for how frontline nurses can improve care for older adults in the ED. Ultimately, to have meaningful impacts on care of older adults in the ED, there is a dire need for greater financial investment specific to geriatric nursing education, training, and research in the ED.","Hunt, Lauren J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.04.011,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13

This fact has caused our center to collapse, with 130% of its beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, thus causing the absolute cessation of activity of the urology service, the practical disappearance of resident training programs, and the incorporation of a good part of the urology staff into the group of medical personnel attending these patients. In order to recover from this extraordinary level of suspended activity, we will be obliged to prioritize pathologies based on purely clinical criteria, for which tables including the relevance of each pathology within each area of urology are being proposed.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Gómez, César Cinesi; Rodríguez, Óscar Peñuelas; Torné, Manel Luján; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jiménez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fernández, Javier García; Manuel Carratalá Perales, José; Heili-Frades, Sarah Béatrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andrés Nilsson, José M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis Sánchez; Ignacio Garrote, José; Serrano, Miguel J Zamorano; Martínez, Mónica González; Muñoz, Eva Farrero; Andrés, Olga Mediano San; Cervera, Gemma Rialp; Serra, Arantxa Mas; Martínez, Gonzalo Hernández; de Haro López, Candelaria; Gas, Oriol Roca; Roca, Ricard Ferrer; Berrocal, Antonio Romero; Ortola, Carlos Ferrando",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

SUMMARY The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a special risk for renal patients due to their comorbidities and advanced age. The usual performance of hemodialysis treatments in collective rooms increases the risk. The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited. This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the Nephrology Services, and in particular in Hemodialysis Units, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatments. They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.","Arenas, María Dolores; Villar, Judit; González, Cristina; Cao, Higinio; Collado, Silvia; Crespo, Marta; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Pascual, Julio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nefro.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nefro.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nefro.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
1483,Situación de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes en tratamiento renal sustitutivo Informe del Registro COVID-19 de la Sociedad Española de Nefrología (S.E.N.),"RESUMEN La reciente aparición de la pandemia por el coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ha impactado de forma muy importante en la población general. Los pacientes en tratamiento renal sustitutivo (TRS) no han sido ajenos a esta situación y por sus características resultan especialmente vulnerables. Presentamos los resultados del análisis del Registro COVID-19 de la S.E.N. Material y métodos: EL Registro comenzó a funcionar el 18 de marzo de 2020. Recoge variables epidemiológicas, datos del contagio y diagnóstico, clínica acompañante, tratamientos y desenlace. Se trata de un registro “on line”. Los pacientes fueron diagnosticados de infección por SARS-Cov-2 en base a los resultados de la PCR del virus, realizada tanto en pacientes que habían manifestado clínica compatible o tenían signos sospechosos como en aquellos a los que se había hecho como cribado tras algún contacto conocido con otro enfermo. Resultados: A fecha 11 de abril el Registro disponía de datos de 868 pacientes, procedentes de todas las Comunidades Autónomas. La modalidad de TRS más representada es la hemodiálisis en centro (HDC) seguida de los pacientes trasplantados. La clínica de presentación es similar a la población general. Un porcentaje muy elevado (85%) requirió ingreso hospitalario, un 8% en unidades de cuidados intensivos. Los tratamientos más utilizados fueron hidroxicloroquina, lopinavir-ritonavir y esteroides. La mortalidad es elevada y alcanza el 23%: los pacientes fallecidos estaban con más frecuencia en HDC, desarrollaban más frecuentemente neumonía y recibían en menos ocasiones lopinavir-ritonavir y esteroides. La edad y la neumonía se asociaban de forma independiente al riesgo de fallecer. Conclusiones: La infección por SARS-CoV-2 afecta ya a un número importante de pacientes españoles en TRS, fundamentalmente aquellos que están en HDC, las tasas de hospitalización son muy elevadas y la mortalidad es elevada; la edad y el desarrollo de neumonía son factores asociados a mortalidad. SUMMARY The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population. Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods: The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an ""online"" registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results: As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","Emilio Sánchez-Álvarez, J.; Fontán, Miguel Pérez; Martín, Carlos Jiménez; Pelícano, Miquel Blasco; Reina, Carlos Jesús Cabezas; Prieto, Ángel M.

Sin embargo, en la esclerosis múltiple, no existe un modelo que permita una visión general de la enfermedad, de forma que es necesario utilizar una variedad de modelos que abarquen los distintos cambios que se producen. Desarrollo Se revisan los distintos modelos experimentales que pueden ser utilizados en la investigación en la esclerosis múltiple, tanto in vitro como in vivo. En relación a los modelos in vitro se analizan los distintos cultivos celulares y sus potenciales modificaciones así como los modelos en rodajas. En los modelos in vivo, se analizan los modelos de base inmune-inflamatoria como la encefalitis alérgica experimental en los distintos animales, además de las enfermedades desmielinizantes por virus. Por otro lado, se analizan los modelos de desmielinización-remielinización incluyéndose las lesiones químicas por cuprizona, lisolecitina, bromuro de etidio, así como el modelo de zebrafish y los modelos transgénicos. Conclusiones Los modelos experimentales nos permiten acercarnos al conocimiento de los diversos mecanismos que ocurren en la esclerosis múltiple. La utilización de cada uno de ellos depende de los objetivos de investigación que planteen. Abstract Introduction Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.A.; Gómez-Pinedo, U.; Matías-Guiu, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
1490,¿Es esperable que haya cuadros neurológicos por la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2?,"Resumen Introducción Diversas evidencias sugieren que el SARS-CoV-2 puede penetrar en el sistema nervioso central (SNC). Los autores revisan los datos de la literatura sobre los hallazgos de coronavirus en el SNC asociado a enfermedades neurológicas. Desarrollo En las distintas epidemias con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV la presencia de cuadros neurológicos es baja, pero se describen cuadros aislados de pacientes. También existen casos asociados a OC43-CoV y 229E-CoV. La existencia de lesiones neurológicas, especialmente desmielinizantes en el modelo MHV-CoV pueden explicar mecanismos de penetración de los CoV en el SNC y especialmente aquellos relacionados con la respuesta inmune, que puede justificar la existencia de CoV en pacientes con esclerosis múltiple. Los autores revisan aspectos diferenciales de SARS-CoV-2 y se plantean si debido al alto número de infectados, el virus puede afectar de forma mayor al SNC. Conclusión Aunque la presencia de síntomas neurológicos en las epidemias de CoV es baja, la mayor frecuencia de infectados por SARS-CoV-2 podría justificar el paso del virus y la posibilidad de clínica neurológica precoz o tardía con mayor incidencia. El seguimiento de los pacientes de la epidemia debe atender con cuidado a la evaluación del SNC. Abstract Introduction There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Desarrollo: Los autores refieren las fórmulas empleadas como son la realización de un plan de reorganización funcional, estrategias para la hospitalización y urgencias, la realización de consultas telefónicas para el mantenimiento de la atención neurológica, la asistencia en una área externa al hospital para pacientes preferentes, las decisiones sobre exploraciones complementarias y tratamientos intrahospitalarios periódicos o implantar un teléfono para la priorización de crisis epilépticas. Conclusión: A pesar de la situación de aislamiento, los servicios de neurología deben mantener la atención de sus pacientes, a través de distintas fórmulas operativas, que como cualquier elemento de gestión, deberán evaluarse. Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care. This article addresses operational decision-making during the epidemic. Development: We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures. Conclusion: Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation.

1492,Influencia de la infección SARS-Cov2 sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas y Neuropsiquiátricas: ¿Una pandemia demorada?,"RESUMEN INTRODUCCIÓN: La infección por el coronavirus SARS-CoV2 originada en Diciembre de 2019 en la región china de Wuhan ha adquirido proporciones pandémicas. A día de hoy ha ocasionado de más de 1,7 millones de contagios y mas de 100.000 muertes en todo el mundo. La investigación científica actual se centra en el mejor conocimiento de la infección aguda y de sus estrategias terapéuticas. Dada la magnitud de la epidemia, planteamos una revisión especulativa sobre las posibles consecuencias en patología neurológica a medio/largo plazo, con especial atención a Enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiquiátricas con base neuroinflamatoria, teniendo en cuenta la evidencia directa de afectación neurológica a causa de la infección aguda. DESARROLLO: Revisamos de forma sistemática lo conocido sobre los mecanismos patogénicos de la infección por SARS-Cov2, la repercusión de la tormenta de citoquinas sobre el Sistema Nervioso Central y su persistencia en el tiempo y las consecuencias que la neuroinflamación puede tener sobre el Sistema Nervioso Central. CONCLUSIONES: El SARS-CoV2 es un virus neuroinvasivo capaz de provocar una tormenta de citoquinas que podría convertirse en persistente en población seleccionada. Aunque nuestra hipótesis tiene alto componente especulativo, la repercusión que esta situación puede tener en la puesta en marcha y progresión de Enfermedades neurodegenerativas y neuropsiquiátricas con base neuroinflamatoria debe ser considerada como posible germen de una pandemia demorada que podría tener un gran impacto en salud pública a medio o largo plazo. Se hace necesario un estrecho seguimiento de la salud cognitiva y neuropsiquiátrica de los pacientes supervivientes a infección Covid19. ABSTRACT Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Serrano-Castro, Pedro J.; Estivill-Torrús, Guillermo; Cabezudo-García, Pablo; Antonio Reyes-Bueno, José; Petersen, Nicolás Ciano; Aguilar-Castillo, María José; Suárez-Pérez, Juan; Jiménez-Hernández, María Dolores; Moya-Molina, Miguel Ángel; Oliver-Martos, Begoña; Arrabal-Gómez, Carlos; de Fonseca, Fernando Rodríguez",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

Material and methods: A key informant survey was used to enquire about the changes expected in the specialty over the next 5 years. The survey was completed by heads of neurology departments with broad knowledge of the situation, having been active during the pandemic. Results: Despite a low level of consensus between participants, there was strong (85%) and moderate consensus (70%) about certain subjects, mainly the increase in precautions to be taken, the use of telemedicine and teleconsultations, the reduction of care provided in in-person consultations to avoid the presence of large numbers of people in waiting rooms, the development of remote training solutions, and the changes in monitoring visits during clinical trials. There was consensus that there would be no changes to the indication of complementary testing or neurological examination.

Recomendaciones Plan Ictus Madrid,"RESUMEN Introducción: La pandemia por COVID-19 ha obligado a una reorganización de los sistemas sanitarios y una saturación excepcional de sus recursos. En este contexto es vital asegurar la atención al ictus agudo y optimizar los procesos asistenciales del código ictus para reducir el riesgo de contagios y racionalizar el uso de recursos hospitalarios. Para ello desde el Grupo multidisciplinar Ictus Madrid proponemos una serie de recomendaciones. Métodos: Revisión bibliográfica no sistemática de las publicaciones disponibles con los términos “stroke” y “covid-19” o “coronavirus” o “SARS-COV-2”, así como otras conocidas por los autores. En base a ésta se redacta un documento de recomendaciones que es sometido a consenso por el Grupo multidisciplinar Ictus Madrid y su Comité de Neurología. Resultados: Las recomendaciones se estructuran en cinco líneas fundamentales: (1) Coordinar la actuación para garantizar el acceso a la asistencia hospitalaria de los pacientes con ictus, (2) Reconocer a los pacientes con ictus potencialmente infectados por COVID-19, (3) Organización adecuada para garantizar la protección de los profesionales sanitarios frente al riesgo de contagio por COVID-19, (4) la realización de Neuroimagen y otros procedimientos que conlleven contactos de riesgo de infección COVID-19 hay que procurar reducirlos y asegurar la protección, y (5) alta y seguimiento seguros procurando optimizar la ocupación hospitalaria. Resumimos el procedimiento de forma esquemática con el acrónimo CORONA (COordinar, Reconocer, Organizar, Neuroimagen, Alta). Conclusiones: Estas recomendaciones pueden servir de apoyo para la organización del sistema sanitario en la atención al ictus agudo y la optimización de sus recursos, garantizando la protección de sus profesionales. ABSTRACT Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a reorganization of healthcare systems and an exceptional saturation of their resources. In this context, it is vital to ensure acute stroke care and optimize the care processes of the stroke code to reduce the risk of contagion and rationalize the use of hospital resources. To do this, the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group proposes a series of recommendations. Methods: Non-systematic bibliographic review of the available publications with the terms “stroke” and “covid-19” or “coronavirus” or “SARS-COV-2”, as well as other already known for the authors. We provide a document of recommendations as a result of the consensus of the Ictus Madrid multidisciplinary group and its Neurology Committee. Results: Our recommendations are structured on five lines: (1) Coordinate to guarantee the access to hospital care for stroke patients, (2) Recognize potentially COVID-19 infected stroke patients, (3) Organize to ensure the protection of healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infections, (4) Neuroimaging and other procedures potentially associated to risks for COVID-19 infection should be reduced and secured to avoid contagion, and (5) At home as soon as possible and supported follow-up to optimize hospital occupancy. The procedure is shown summarized under the acronym CORONA (Coordinate, Recognize, Organize, Neuroimaging, At home). Conclusions: These recommendations can support the organization of healthcare services for acute stroke care and the optimization of their resources, guaranteeing the protection of healthcare professionals.","Rodríguez-Pardo, Jorge; Fuentes, Blanca; de Leciñana, María Alonso; Campollo, Jorge; Castaño, Patricia Calleja; Ruiz, Joaquín Carneado; Egido Herrero, José; Leal, Roberto García; Núñez, Antonio Gil; Cerezo, Jorge Francisco Gómez; Martínez, Alfonso Martín; Vallejo, Jaime Masjuan; Aguado, Blanca Palomino; López, Nicolás Riera; de las Heras, Rogelio Simón; Vivancos Mora, José; Tejedor, Exuperio Díez",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.008,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

Method: Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables. In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. Results: Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. Conclusion: Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary.","de Figueiredo, Alexandre Medeiros; Codina, Antonio Daponte; de Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina Moreira Marculino; Gil-García, Eugenia; Kalache, Alexandre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1509,Medidas de contención de la violencia de género durante la pandemia de COVID-19,"Resumen Las crisis, las emergencias y las épocas de disturbios se han relacionado con un aumento de la violencia interpersonal, incluida la violencia hacia las mujeres. A raíz de la declaración de estado de alarma y confinamiento se han puesto en marcha nuevas medidas encaminadas a paliar el posible impacto de la violencia de género (Plan de contingencia contra la violencia de género ante la crisis del coronavirus o Real Decreto-Ley de medidas urgentes). Se revisan en este documento las medidas de contención adoptadas hasta el momento por el gobierno de España y las comunidades autónomas, y las iniciativas formuladas en diferentes países. Ante la ausencia de medidas económicas concretas planteadas hasta la fecha y el escenario de incertidumbre económica concluimos que no es posible prevenir la violencia de género de manera integral sin considerar el aumento del desempleo, la temporalidad y la inestabilidad laboral, la dependencia económica o la sobrecarga de tareas reproductivas, entre otros elementos que la facilitan. Abstract Crises, emergencies and times of unrest have been linked to increased interpersonal violence, including violence against women. Following the declaration of alarm status and quarantine, different measures have been implemented to mitigate the possible effect of gender violence (Contingency Plan against Gender-Based Violence in Coronavirus Crisis or Royal Decree Law on Emergency Measures). This document reviews the measures adopted so far by the government of Spain, the autonomous governments and the initiatives formulated in different countries. In the absence of concrete economic measures to date, and the scenario of economic uncertainty, we conclude that it is not possible to prevent gender-based violence in a comprehensive way, without considering the increase in unemployment, temporary and instability employment, economic dependency or the overload of household chores and reproductive tasks, among other elements that facilitate it.","Ruiz-Pérez, Isabel; Pastor-Moreno, Guadalupe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.005,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

1515,ESPEN expert statements and practical guidance for nutritional management of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Summary The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C.; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Krznaric, Zeljko; Nitzan, Dorit; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

This study investigates the implications of outsourcing on healthcare supply chains by comparing two alternatives: outsourcing from public-to-private and outsourcing from public-to-public. A conceptual framework, adapted from previous literature, has been employed to provide a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon and consider the implications of logistics and procurement outsourcing on the healthcare supply chain structure and performance. The study presents a European cross-country comparison, analysing both the National Health Service (NHS) outsourcing in England (public-to-private outsourcing) and the Regional Health Service (RHS) outsourcing in the Tuscany region (Italy) (public-to-public outsourcing). Specificities and commonalities of the two outsourcing experiences provide suggestions for managers and policy-makers and enhance the current knowledge of outsourcing in the public healthcare sector.","Skipworth, Heather; Delbufalo, Emanuela; Mena, Carlos",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.emj.2020.04.002,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

Shortages have been particularly prevalent in western countries which typically rely upon global supply chains to obtain these types of device from low-cost economies. National calls for the repurposing of domestic mass-production facilities have the potential to meet medical requirements in coming weeks, however the immediate demand associated with the virus has led to the mobilisation of a diverse distributed workforce. Selection of appropriate manufacturing processes and underused supply chains is paramount to the success of these operations. A simplified medical face shield design is presented which repurposes an assortment of existing alternative supply chains. The device is easy to produce with minimal equipment and training. It is hoped that the methodology and approach presented is of use to the wider community at this critical time.","Shokrani, Alborz; Loukaides, Evripides G.; Elias, Edward; Lunt, Alexander J.G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108749,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108749,Elsevier,10.1016/j.matdes.2020.108749,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
1543,Recombinant infectious bronchitis coronavirus H120 with the spike protein S1 gene of the nephropathogenic IBYZ strain remains attenuated but induces protective immunity,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious viral disease responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry. A reverse genetic vaccine is a safe, rapid, and effective method of achieving IB prevention and control. In this study, we constructed the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, using a reverse genetic system, based on the backbone of the H120 vaccine strain, with the S1 gene replaced with that of the QX-like nephropathogenic strain, ck/CH/IBYZ/2011, isolated in China. The results of dwarf chicken embryos, growth kinetics, and viral titration in the embryos demonstrated that the biological characteristics of the recombinant virus remained unchanged. Like the rH120-infected group and in contrast to the rIBYZ-infected group, no mortality, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rH120-S1/YZ. The viral loads in various tissues, cloacal, and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples, indicating that the rH120-S1/YZ strain was highly safe in chicks. Compared to rH120 vaccination group, when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the QX-like IBV strain, better protection, with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rH120-S1/YZ. Increased levels of IBV-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination. Collectively, our results suggest that the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, may represent a promising vaccine candidate against QX-like IBVs.","Jiang, Yi; Cheng, Xu; Zhao, Xiumei; Yu, Yan; Gao, Mingyan; Zhou, Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
1544,Arboviruses: A global public health threat,"Abstract A conference on «ARBOVIRUSES, A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT» was organized on June 20–22, 2018 at the Merieux Foundation Conference Center in Veyrier du Lac, France, to review and raise awareness to the global public health threat of epidemic arboviruses, and to advance the discussion on the control and prevention of arboviral diseases. The presentations by scientists and public health officials from Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa strengthened the notion that arboviral diseases of both humans and domestic animals are progressively becoming dominant public health problems in the world. The repeated occurrence of recent deadly epidemics strongly reinforces the call for action against these viral diseases, and the need for developing effective vaccines, drugs, vector control tools and strong prevention programs.","Girard, Marc; Nelson, Christopher B.; Picot, Valentina; Gubler, Duane J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.011,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
1545,An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors’ CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design,Abstract The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.,"Herst, C.V.; Burkholz, S.; Sidney, J.; Sette, A.; Harris, P.E.; Massey, S.; Brasel, T.; Cunha-Neto, E.; Rosa, D.S.; Chao, W.C.H.; Carback, R.; Hodge, T.; Wang, L.; Ciotlos, S.; Lloyd, P.; Rubsamen, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.034,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.04.034,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

1548,An opportunity to incentivize innovation to increase vaccine safety in the United States by improving vaccine delivery using vaccine patches,"Abstract Vaccines represent cost-effective and safe interventions that provide substantial health and economic benefits to individuals and populations. The US vaccine enterprise that supports all aspects of immunization continues to encourage innovation. Despite some limited historical recommendations to create a fund to support investments in vaccine safety, and recent legislation that supports innovation for new vaccines (the 21st Century Cures Act, Public Law 114-255), to date the US lacks financial incentives to fund innovation in vaccine delivery technologies. Building on separate reviews of the US Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and the state of development of vaccine patches as an innovative vaccine delivery platform, we suggest an opportunity to allocate some VICP Trust Fund resources to prevent future VICP claims by creating a new incentives fund to support translational studies for improving vaccine delivery technologies.

Clinicians are modifying the way they approach day-to-day procedures. Safety and reduction transmission risk is paramount. Surgical tracheostomies in covid19 patients are aerosol generating procedures linked with a significant risk of viral contamination. Here, we describe our local approach for these procedures, introducing the “5Ts” of safe tracheostomy practice: Theatre set-up, Team Briefing, Transfer of patient, Tracheostomy Procedure, Team Doffing and de-brief. We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks linked with breaking the transfer circuit to link the patient to the theatre ventilator. We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea. We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer. We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this. We summarise the steps in our protocol in an “easy to reproduce” way. Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging circumstances.","Damian, Broderick; Panayiotis, Kyzas; Kevin, Sanders; Alistair, Sawyerr; Chetan, Katre; Leandros, Vassiliou",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.04.008,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

1562,"Characterization, pro-inflammatory response and cytotoxic profile of bioaerosols from urban and rural residential settings in Pune, India","Abstract Microbiota associated with airborne particulate matter (PM) is an important indicator of indoor pollution as they can be pathogenic and cause serious health threats to the exposed occupants. Present study aimed to investigate the level of culturable microbes associated with PM and their toxicological characterization in urban and rural houses of Pune city. Highest concentration of bacterial aerosols observed to be associated with PM10 size fraction in urban site (2136 ± 285 CFU/m3) whereas maximum fungal concentration has been measured in rural houses (1521 ± 302 CFU/m3). Predominantly found bacterial species were Bacillus sp., S. aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal species were Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. in both urban and rural residential premises. Concentration of endotoxin measured using the kinetic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay exhibited that the level of endotoxin in both urban and rural sites are associated with household characteristics and the activities performed in indoor as well as outdoor. Cell free DTT assay confirmed the ability of these airborne microbes to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) varying along with the types of microorganisms. On exposure of A549 cells to airborne microbes, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed in terms of both necrosis and apoptosis pathway. Elevated production of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines in epithelial cells and macrophages clearly suggest the inflammatory nature of these airborne microbes. Results derived from the present study demonstrated that the indoor air of urban and rural houses of Pune is contaminated in terms of microbial load. Therefore, attention should be paid to control the factors favoring the microbial growth in order to safeguard the health of exposed inhabitants.","Roy, Ritwika; Jan, Rohi; Joshi, Uttara; Bhor, Renuka; Pai, Kalpana; Satsangi, P.

1563,Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?,"Abstract This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lethality and the atmospheric pollution in Northern Italy. Indeed, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna are Italian regions with both the highest level of virus lethality in the world and one of Europe’s most polluted area. Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects. We conclude that the high level of pollution in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.","Conticini, Edoardo; Frediani, Bruno; Caro, Dario",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,Elsevier,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1575,"A review on MnZn ferrites: Synthesis, characterization and applications","Abstract Researchers are taking great interest in the synthesis and characterization of MnZn ferrites due to their wide range of applications in many areas. MnZn ferrites are a class of soft magnetic materials that have very good electrical, magnetic and optical properties. The properties of MnZn ferrites include high value of resistivity, permeability, permittivity, saturation magnetization, low power losses and coercivity. The above mentioned advantageous features of MnZn ferrites make them suitable for the use in various applications. In biomedical field these ferrites are used for cancer treatment and MRI. MnZn ferrites are also used in electronic applications for making transformers, transducers and inductors. These ferrites are also used in magnetic fluids, sensors and biosensors. MnZn ferrite is highly useful material for several electrical and electronic applications. It finds applications in almost every household appliances like mobile charger, LED bulb, TV, refrigerator, juicer mixer, washing machine, iron, microwave oven, mobile, laptop, desktop, printer and so on. Therefore, the present review focuses on different techniques for synthesis of MnZn ferrites in literature, their characterization tools, effect of doping on the properties of MnZn ferrite and finally we will discuss about their applications.","Thakur, Preeti; Chahar, Deepika; Taneja, Shilpa; Bhalla, Nikhil; Thakur, Atul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.287,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.287,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.287,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
1576,"Abortion at the edges: Politics, practices, performances","Abstract This article provides a brief overview of the state of discourse, politics and provision of abortion in the Anglophone West, including developments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It then surveys three promising directions for feminist abortion scholarship. The first is work inspired by the Reproductive Justice Movement, that points to the intersectional axes of inequality that shape abortion discourse and position us in relation to reproductive choice and access issues. The second is work that examines the particularity of the constitution of the aborting body, reflecting the particularity of the pregnant body. This is a specific body, with a specific history; abortion discourse draws from and makes a significant contribution to the meaning and lived experience of this body. The third area of scholarship we highlight is that which seeks to amplify the meaning of abortion as a social good. Much abortion scholarship is attuned to a critique of negative aspects of abortion—from its representation in popular culture to restrictive law and access issues. This is critical work but/and the performative nature of abortion scholarship, like all discourse, means that it can amplify the association of negativity with abortion. The article concludes by introducing the articles contained in the special section of Women's Studies International Forum, ‘Abortion at the edges: Politics, practices, performances’.","Baird, Barbara; Millar, Erica",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102372,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102372,Elsevier,10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102372,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

1581,The Roles of Bacteria and Viruses in Bronchiectasis Exacerbation: A Prospective Study,"Abstract Background Exacerbations are crucial events during bronchiectasis progression. Objectives To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3–6 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. Results The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0–2.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76–6.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35–4.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11–4.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P <.05). Sputum interleukin-1β levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P <.05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P =.019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. Conclusions Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.","Chen, Chun-Lan; Huang, Yan; Yuan, Jing-Jing; Li, Hui-Min; Han, Xiao-Rong; Martinez-Garcia, Miguel Angel; de la Rosa-Carrillo, David; Chen, Rong-chang; Guan, Wei-Jie; Zhong, Nan-Shan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

Actualmente, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha definido la infección como pandemia y existe una situación de emergencia sanitaria y social para el manejo de esta nueva infección. Mientras que la mayoría de las personas con COVID-19 desarrollan solo una enfermedad leve o no complicada, aproximadamente el 14% desarrolla una enfermedad grave que requiere hospitalización y oxígeno, y el 5% puede requerir ingreso en una Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (1). En casos severos, COVID-19 puede complicarse por el síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda (SDRA), sepsis y shock séptico y fracaso multiorgánico. Este documento de consenso se ha preparado sobre directrices basadas en evidencia desarrolladas por un panel multidisciplinario de profesionales médicos de cuatro sociedades científicas españolas (Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias [SEMICYUC], Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica [SEPAR], Sociedad Española de Urgencias y Emergencias [SEMES], Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor [SEDAR]) con experiencia en el manejo clínico de pacientes con COVID-19 y otras infecciones virales, incluido el SARS, así como en sepsis y SDRA. El documento proporciona recomendaciones clínicas para el soporte respiratorio no invasivo (ventilación no invasiva, oxigenoterapia de alto flujo con cánula nasal) en cualquier paciente con presentación sospechada o confirmada de COVID-19 con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda. Esta guía de consenso debe servir como base para una atención optimizada y garantizar la mejor posibilidad de supervivencia, así como permitir una comparación fiable de las futuras intervenciones terapéuticas de investigación que formen parte de futuros estudios observacionales o de ensayos clínicos. Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Gómez, César Cinesi; Rodríguez, Óscar Peñuelas; Torné, Manel Luján; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jiménez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fernández, Javier García; Manuel Carratalá Perales, José; Heili-Frades, Sarah Béatrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andrés Nilsson, José M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis Sánchez; Ignacio Garrote, José; Serrano, Miguel J.

En este consenso se propone la realización de una exploración sistemática ecográfica del tórax dividiéndolo por cuadrantes e identificando los signos ecográficos que se relacionen con el tipo de afectación parenquimatosa o pleural que tiene el paciente: líneas A, líneas B, condensación parenquimatosa, línea pleural y derrame pleural. Estos hallazgos nos facilitarán la toma de decisiones respecto al manejo del paciente, tanto en la decisión del lugar de ingreso del paciente como en el tipo de tratamiento que debemos pautar. Abstract The great pulmonary affectation produced by the COVID-19 infection, requires a fast diagnostic tool that complements the diagnostic test by PCR and which is also useful in evaluating the progression of lung lesions. Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT. In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.

Es importante tener en cuenta que, dado que la información evoluciona con extremada rapidez en este campo, lo expuesto en el presente documento puede estar sujeto a modificaciones. La población de mayor edad es especialmente susceptible a la infección por COVID-19, así como a desarrollar criterios de gravedad. Este aumento de morbimortalidad en el paciente mayor se ha asociado tanto con las comorbilidades, especialmente la enfermedad cardiovascular, como con la situación de fragilidad, que conlleva una respuesta inmunológica más pobre. La situación actual, tanto por los países afectados como por el número de casos, constituye una pandemia y supone una emergencia sanitaria de primer nivel.

Abstract SARS-CoV2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease-19), was first identified in December 2019. In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency.

Se ha descrito que estos pacientes sufren un estado inflamatorio que condiciona un alto riesgo trombótico. Sin embargo, apenas hay información sobre cómo abordar el riesgo trombótico, la coagulopatía y el tratamiento anticoagulante de estos pacientes. Por otra parte, incluso los pacientes no infectados por COVID-19 sufren una tremenda influencia en su abordaje habitual por la situación sanitaria actual.

1594,Renin-angiotensin system at the heart of COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation. This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.","Alifano, Marco; Alifano, Pietro; Forgez, Patricia; Iannelli, Antonio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.biochi.2020.04.008,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

1598,"In-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Abstract Objective To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China. Methods The outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated. Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style. The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome. Results Data from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward. The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%. Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated <1 min. The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%). Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days. Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes. Conclusion Survival of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest was poor in Wuhan.","Shao, Fei; Xu, Shuang; Ma, Xuedi; Xu, Zhouming; Lyu, Jiayou; Ng, Michael; Cui, Hao; Yu, Changxiao; Zhang, Qing; Sun, Peng; Tang, Ziren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.04.005,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

1601,COVID-19 in cardiac arrest and infection risk to rescuers: a systematic review,"Abstract Background There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest. The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. Methods We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: 1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; 2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and 3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organisation COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. Results We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. Conclusion It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers. There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but no data concerning kidney transplant (KTx) recipients infected with COVID-19 are available. To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset. Four patients received a reduced dose of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy during hospitalization. As of March 4, 2020 NAT was negative for COVID-19 in three patients twice in succession, and their computed tomography scans showed improved images. Although greater patient numbers and long-term follow-up data are needed, our series demonstrates that mild COVID-19 infection in KTx recipients can be managed using symptomatic support therapy combined with adjusted maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.","Zhang, Hui; Chen, Yan; Yuan, Quan; Xia, Qiu-Xiang; Zeng, Xian-Peng; Peng, Jing-Tao; Liu, Jing; Xiao, Xing-Yuan; Jiang, Guo-Song; Xiao, Han-Yu; Xie, Liang-Bo; Chen, Jing; Liu, Jia-Li; Xiao, Xiong; Su, Hua; Zhang, Chun; Zhang, Xiao-Ping; Yang, Hua; Li, Heng; Wang, Zhen-Di",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Objective To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Design, setting, and participants A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. Intervention Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. Results and limitations The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. Conclusions Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding. Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations. Patient summary Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment.","Zhu, Lan; Gong, Nianqiao; Liu, Bin; Lu, Xia; Chen, Dong; Chen, Song; Shu, Hongge; Ma, Ke; Xu, Xizhen; Guo, Zhiliang; Lu, Enfeng; Chen, Dongrui; Ge, Qinggang; Cai, Junchao; Jiang, Jipin; Wei, Lai; Zhang, Weijie; Chen, Gang; Chen, Zhishui",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.039,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.039,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

1617,Assessing the Burden of Nondeferrable Major Uro-oncologic Surgery to Guide Prioritisation Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from Three Italian High-volume Referral Centres,"Abstract The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented emergency scenario for all aspects of health care, including urology. At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres. Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%). Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced. Patient summary: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres to evaluate how many surgeries performed for prostate, bladder, kidney, and upper tract urothelial cancer can be postponed in times of emergency. We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery. Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk. These patients may pose challenges in allocation of resources in critical scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Campi, Riccardo; Amparore, Daniele; Capitanio, Umberto; Checcucci, Enrico; Salonia, Andrea; Fiori, Cristian; Minervini, Andrea; Briganti, Alberto; Carini, Marco; Montorsi, Francesco; Serni, Sergio; Porpiglia, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.054,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.054,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

We explored whether telemedicine (defined as a videoconference) might help. We undertook prospective structured phone interviews of urological patients (n = 399). We evaluated their suitability for telemedicine (judged by a panel of four physicians) and their risks from COVID-19 (10 factors for a poor outcome), and collected willingness for telemedicine and demographic data. Risk factors for an adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection were common (94.5% had one or more) and most patients (63.2%) were judged suitable for telemedicine. When asked, 84.7% of patients wished for a telemedical rather than a face-to-face consultation. Those favouring telemedicine were younger (68 [58–75] vs 76 [70–79.2] yr, p < 0.001). There was no difference in preference with oncological (mean 86%) or benign diagnoses (mean 85%), or with COVID-19 risks factors. In subgroup analysis, men with prostate cancer preferred telemedicine (odds ratio: 2.93 [1.07–8.03], p = 0.037). We concluded that many urological patients have risk factors for a poor outcome from COVID-19 and most preferred telemedicine consultations at this time.

1640,Transmission of pathogen-laden expiratory droplets in a coach bus,"Abstract Droplet dispersion carrying viruses/bacteria in enclosed/crowded buses may induce transmissions of respiratory infectious diseases, but the influencing mechanisms have been rarely investigated. By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 μm and 50 μm, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35% and 95%) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 μm droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35% and 95% respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 μm droplets. Thus 10 μm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 μm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.","Yang, Xia; Ou, Cuiyun; Yang, Hongyu; Liu, Li; Song, Tie; Kang, Min; Lin, Hualiang; Hang, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122609,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12
1641,Determination of Air Filter Anti-Viral Efficiency against an Airborne Infectious Virus,"Abstract Recently, various studies have reported the prevention and treatment of respiratory infection outbreaks caused by lethal viruses. Consequently, a variety of air filters coated with antimicrobial agents have been developed to capture and inactivate virus particles in continuous airflow conditions. However, since aerosolized infectious viral-testing is inadvisable due to safety concerns, their anti-viral capability has only been tested by inserting the filters into liquid media, where infectious virus particles disperse. In this study a novel method of determining anti-viral performance of an air filter against airborne infectious viruses is presented. Initially, anti-viral air filter tests were conducted. Firstly, by an air-media test, in which the air filter was placed against an aerosolized non-infectious virus. Secondly, by a liquid-media test, in which the filter was inserted into a liquid medium containing a non-infectious virus. Subsequently, a correlation was established by comparing the susceptibility constants obtained between the two medium tests and an association was found for the air medium test with infectious virus. After ensuring the relationship did not depend on the virus species, the correlation was used to derive the results of the air-medium test from the results of the liquid-medium test.","Park, Dae Hoon; Joe, Yun Haeng; Piri, Amin; An, Sanggwon; Hwang, Jungho",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122640,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

1649,"SARS – CoV -2: reasons of epidemiology of severe ill disease cases and therapeutic approach using trivalent vaccine (tetanus, diphtheria and Bordetella pertussis)","Abstract The novel coronavirus COVID-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses. Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury. Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups. Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation. Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against COVID-19. The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (“Spanish flu” 1918, “Asian flu” 1956 and “the Hong Kong flu” 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines. The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4+ memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response. According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4+ memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting “lung crash” until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection. In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the COVID-19 will occur.","Ietto, Giuseppe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109779,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109779,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109779,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

1654,Vitamin D: A simpler alternative to tocilizumab for trial in COVID-19?,"Abstract There is anecdotal evidence that tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant drug, may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with severe manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like tocilizumab, Vitamin D appears to modulate the activity of an interleukin (IL-6), which may explain the seasonal variation in prevalence of influenza. While most cases of COVID-19 have, thus far, occurred in the Northern Hemisphere winter, limiting the ability to assess seasonal variation, there remains substantial variation in the severity of this condition that has yet to be explained. A retrospective comparison of Vitamin D levels in previously obtained blood samples between survivors and confirmed fatalities could establish a rationale for implementation of widespread Vitamin D supplementation. This would be far cheaper and simpler than tocilizumab as a therapeutic option to trial.","Silberstein, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109767,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109767,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109767,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1655,The old but new: Can unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparins inhibit proteolytic activation and cellular internalization of SARS-CoV2 by inhibition of host cell proteases?,"Abstract Currently, our world is facing the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and tremendous efforts are made for developing drugs to treat and vaccines to prevent the disease. At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1–S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk–benefit judgement of the clinician. Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies.","Belen-Apak, F.B.; Sarialioglu, F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109743,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109743,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109743,30/09/2020,NA,NA,2020-09-30
1656,A data-driven hypothesis on the epigenetic dysregulation of host metabolism by SARS coronaviral infection: potential implications for the SARS-CoV-2 modus operandi,"Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus structurally similar to SARS-CoV. Based on both structural and syndromic similarities with SARS-CoV, a hypothesis is formed on SARS-CoV-2 potential to affect the host’s metabolism as part of its lifecycle. This hypothesis is evaluated by (a) exploratory analysis of SARS-CoV / human transcriptomic interaction data and gene set enrichment analysis (b) a confirmatory, focused review of the literature based on the findings by (a). A STRING Viruses (available search for human – SARS-CoV (NCBI taxonomy Id: 9606 vs. NCBI taxonomy Id: 694009) genomic interactions reveals ten human proteins, interacting with SARS-CoV: SGTA, FGL2, SPECC1, STAT3, PHB, BCL2L1, PPP1CA, CAV1, JUN, XPO1. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) with STRING on this network revealed their role as a putative protein – protein interaction network (PPI; Enrichment p-value=0.0296) mediating, viral parasitism, interleukin as well as insulin signaling, diabetes and triglyceride catabolism. In the literature, SARS-CoV has been known to cause de novo diabetes by ACE2-dependent uptake on pancreatic isle cells, and furthermore dysregulate lipid autophagy in favor of the viral lifecycle. Conversely, currently there are only non-causative, observational evidence of worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients with comorbid diabetes or hyperglycemia. No study has reported on the lipid profiles of COVID-19 patients; however, lipid-targeting molecules have been proposed as agents against SARS-CoV-2. Future studies, reporting on lipid and glucose metabolism of COVID-19 patients could help elucidate the disease’s seculae and aid drug design.","Vavougios, George D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109759,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109759,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109759,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1657,Hypothesized behavioral host manipulation by SARS-CoV2 / COVID-19 infection,"Abstract Although not widely studied, behavioral host manipulation by various pathogens has been documented. Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host’s central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal’s saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.","Barton, Michael C.; Bennett, Kaylee V.; Cook, John R.; Gallup, Gordon G.; Platek, Steven M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109750,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1658,May patients receiving 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors be in higher risk of COVID-19 complications ?,"Abstract COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers. Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females. Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males. Background With increasing number of COVID-19 cases, an evident sex- dependent difference in disease outcomes can be observed. Based on published studies with short term follow-up, males have 65% higher mortality rate (1). The question remains, whether long term observational studies will confirm improved recovery in females.","Adamowicz, Jan; Juszczak, Kajetan; Drewa, Tomasz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109751,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109751,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109751,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1659,Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays as a rapid diagnostic for COVID-19,"Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has emerged, rapidly spreading and severely straining the capacity of the global health community. Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 hours to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ∼100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.","Kashir, Junaid; Yaqinuddin, Ahmed",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109786,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109786,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109786,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
1660,Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with covid-19?,"Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.","Carboni, Elena; Carta, Anna Rosa; Carboni, Ezio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

With the onset of COVID-19 we have noticed an increase in the number of patients who have presented with new onset of complete smell loss to the senior author’s practice in Tehran, Iran. This anosmia and the frequency with which patients present is highly unusual. Coronaviruses have been known to cause common cold symptoms. COVID-19 infections have been described as causing more severe respiratory infections and the symptoms reported by authors from Wuhan, China have not specifically included anosmia. We describe patients who have presented during a two-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic with complete loss of sense of smell. Most had either no symptoms or mild respiratory symptoms. Many had a normal otolaryngologic exam. A relationship between COVID-19 and anosmia should be considered during the pandemic. We hypothesize that the mechanism of injury is similar to that of other coronavirus infections that cause central and peripheral neurologic deficits.","Gilani, Sapideh; Roditi, Rachel; Naraghi, Mohsen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109757,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109757,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109757,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1664,Hydroxychloroquine as an aerosol might markedly reduce and even prevent severe clinical symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.","Klimke, A.; Hefner, G.; Will, B.; Voss, U.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109783,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109783,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109783,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

The crucial action to gain the force in the fight of COVID-19 is to have powerful monitoring of the site forming infected patients. Most of the initial tests rely on detecting the genetic material of the coronavirus, and they have a poor detection rate with the time-consuming operation. In the ongoing process, radiological imaging is also preferred where chest X-rays are highlighted in the diagnosis. Early studies express the patients with an abnormality in chest X-rays pointing to the presence of the COVID-19. On this motivation, there are several studies cover the deep learning-based solutions to detect the COVID-19 using chest X-rays. A part of the existing studies use non-public datasets, others perform on complicated Artificial Intelligent (AI) structures. In our study, we demonstrate an AI-based structure to outperform the existing studies. The SqueezeNet that comes forward with its light network design is tuned for the COVID-19 diagnosis with Bayesian optimization additive. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and augmented dataset make the proposed network perform much better than existing network designs and to obtain a higher COVID-19 diagnosis accuracy.","Ucar, Ferhat; Korkmaz, Deniz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109761,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109761,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109761,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1668,Airborne route and bad use of ventilation systems as non-negligible factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission,"Summary The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion. Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. However, transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions of from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, for example, also suggested airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities HVAC systems.","Correia, G.; Rodrigues, L.; Silva, MG.; Gonçalves, T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109781,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109781,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109781,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
1669,AI governance in the public sector: Three tales from the frontiers of automated decision-making in democratic settings,"Abstract The rush to understand new socio-economic contexts created by the wide adoption of AI is justified by its far-ranging consequences, spanning almost every walk of life. Yet, the public sector's predicament is a tragic double bind: its obligations to protect citizens from potential algorithmic harms are at odds with the temptation to increase its own efficiency - or in other words - to govern algorithms, while governing by algorithms. Whether such dual role is even possible, has been a matter of debate, the challenge stemming from algorithms' intrinsic properties, that make them distinct from other digital solutions, long embraced by the governments, create externalities that rule-based programming lacks. As the pressures to deploy automated decision making systems in the public sector become prevalent, this paper aims to examine how the use of AI in the public sector in relation to existing data governance regimes and national regulatory practices can be intensifying existing power asymmetries. To this end, investigating the legal and policy instruments associated with the use of AI for strenghtening the immigration process control system in Canada; “optimising” the employment services” in Poland, and personalising the digital service experience in Finland, the paper advocates for the need of a common framework to evaluate the potential impact of the use of AI in the public sector. In this regard, it discusses the specific effects of automated decision support systems on public services and the growing expectations for governments to play a more prevalent role in the digital society and to ensure that the potential of technology is harnessed, while negative effects are controlled and possibly avoided. This is of particular importance in light of the current COVID-19 emergency crisis where AI and the underpinning regulatory framework of data ecosystems, have become crucial policy issues as more and more innovations are based on large scale data collections from digital devices, and the real-time accessibility of information and services, contact and relationships between institutions and citizens could strengthen – or undermine - trust in governance systems and democracy.","Kuziemski, Maciej; Misuraca, Gianluca",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976,Elsevier,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

By analyzing the actual data from the Zhangjiakou fuel cell transit bus project, this research reveals it is economically feasible to commercialize FCV in areas with abundant renewable resources. Low electricity for water electrolysis, localization of H2 supply, and curtailed end price of H2 refueling effectively reduce the hydrogen production, delivery and refueling cost, and render a chance for the profitability of refueling stations.

Methods: COVID-19 literature review and consensus establishment between different Spanish ophthalmology societies in order to provide guidelines and recommendations of maximum resources primarily conditioned by the state of alert, confinement and social distancing that occurs in Spain since March 16, 2020. Results: The recommendations will promote the adoption of action and protection measures for eye care in outpatient clinics, surgical areas and hospitalization, for unconfirmed (asymptomatic and symptomatic) and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Measures must be adapted to the circumstances and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in each of the centers and Autonomous Communities, which will be updated according to the pandemic phases and the measures adopted by the Spanish Government. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, attention to the potential health risks to the population caused by coronavirus should prevail over the possible progression of the common eye diseases. Ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals must assume a possible progression of these diseases due to the impossibility of adequate patient follow-up.","Gegúndez-Fernández, José A; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier; Garay-Aramburu, Gonzaga; Muñoz-Negrete, Francisco J; Barrio, Javier Mendicute del; Pablo-Júlvez, Luis; García-Delpech, Salvador; López-Alemany, Antonio; Arnalich-Montiel, Francisco; Cordero-Coma, Miguel; Cárceles, Juan Antonio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oftal.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oftal.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.oftal.2020.04.002,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25

1684,An adaptive parareal algorithm,"Abstract In this paper, we consider the problem of accelerating the numerical simulation of time dependent problems by time domain decomposition. The available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel efficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive solver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the algorithm provides a solution that has the fine solver’s high-fidelity physics and high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiff ODEs, which are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is time and efficiency is affected by the cost of the coarse solver.","Maday, Y.; Mula, O.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2020.112915,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2020.112915,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cam.2020.112915,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09
1685,Assessment of preparedness against emerging infectious disease among private hospitals in a district of South India,"Abstract Background The emergence of many infectious diseases has been of serious public health implication in the 21st century. Hospital preparedness is a key step in strengthening a country’s ability to address any public health emergency of international concern caused by these diseases. In India, because 80% of the health-care utilization happens in the private hospitals, it is of at most importance to assess the preparedness level of these hospitals against emerging infectious diseases. Methods The study was a cross-sectional study, and hospitals which provided consent were included. The estimated participants for the study were 54. Results The results were expressed in a descriptive manner. For the purpose of analysis, the questionnaire was redistributed based on the monitoring and evaluation framework of International Health Regulations and its core capacities. It was found that there was a need to enhance the preparedness of the hospitals in the response against emerging infectious diseases. There were gaps in the implementation of various plans and protocols for staff training, risk communication, surge capacity, laboratory capacity, and infection control in the hospitals. Conclusion The findings were suggestive of a need for preparedness of the hospitals against the upsurge of emerging infectious diseases.","Ambat, Aishwarya S.; Vyas, Navya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.02.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.02.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.02.007,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

1688,Healthcare impact of COVID-19 epidemic in India: A stochastic mathematical model,"Abstract Background In India, the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 epidemic has grown to 1251 cases and 32 deaths as on 30 Mar 2020. The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied using a stochastic mathematical model. Methods A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirements, and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in more than 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at current growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (±18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (±3298) ICU admissions, and 13,447 (±1819) deaths. This would overwhelm India's healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (±33,735) total infections, 10,214 (±1649) hospitalizations, 2121 (±334) ICU admissions, and 1081 (±169) deaths. Conclusion At the current growth rate of epidemic, India's healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by the end of May. With the immediate institution of NPIs, total cases, hospitalizations, ICU requirements, and deaths can be reduced by almost 90%.","Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Chatterjee, Kaushik; Kumar, Arun; Shankar, Subramanian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

While these numbers are not comparable with values observed for the USA, Italy, or Spain, given the population of India, and the fact that the pandemic is now in an exponential stage of growth, the risks of a contagion that affects a large sector of the Indian population are real. There are no current effective strategies to prevent the spread, other than minimizing contact through social distancing, while no fully effective drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19 exist, although several candidate drugs and repurposed antiviral and immune-modulating pharmacotherapies are being tested or in compassionate use. One postexposure prophylaxis, convalescent (immune) plasma (CP), has shown some success in China and previously in the cure and therapy of other coronaviruses, SARS-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Drawn from current patients who are infected with COVID-19, its CP (human anti–SARS-CoV-2 plasma) might be one way to modulate the infectivity of this virus or its effects postinfection.","Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.04.006,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1692,Origin and transmission of Feline coronavirus type I in domestic cats from Northern Italy: a phylogeographic approach,"ABSTRACT Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is responsible, along with an inadequate immune response of the host, for Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), one of the most frequent and deadly infectious feline disease worldwide. This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of the spike (S) gene of 33 FCoVs circulating in Northern Italy between 2011 and 2015 in cats with or without FIP. In order to reconstruct the most probable places of origin and dispersion of FCoV among Italian cats, a phylogeographic approach was performed based on 106 FCoV S gene partial sequences from cats, including the 33 novel Italian sequences and 73 retrieved from public databases. Only FCoV type I was found in the Italian cats. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of FCoV was 2.4 × 10-2 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 1.3-3.7 × 10-2), confirming the high genetic variability in the circulating strains. All the isolates clustered in a unique highly significant clade that likely originated from USA between the 1950s and the 1970s, confirming the first descriptions of the disease in American cats. Our results suggest that from USA the virus likely entered Germany and thereafter spread to other European countries. Phylogeography showed that sequences segregated mainly by geographical origin. In the 2010s Italian sequences clustered in different subclades, confirming that different strains cocirculate in Italy. Further studies on archival samples and other genetic regions of FCoV are suggested in order to confirm the present results and to reconstruct a more in-depth detailed virus dispersion pattern for the definition of possible control measures.","Lauzi, Stefania; Stranieri, Angelica; Giordano, Alessia; Luzzago, Camilla; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Paltrinieri, Saverio; Ebranati, Erika",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108667,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108667,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108667,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12
1693,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"Abstract COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic. This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population – and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.","Grech, Victor",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

1696,Disease control through removal of population using Z-control approach,"Abstract Present study considers the situation where the removal of population is adopted as a prevention measure for isolating the susceptible population from an infected region to reduce the disease prevalence. To investigate the scenario, a dynamic error based method, Z-type control is applied in an SI type disease model with the aim of achieving a predetermined disease prevalence. The controlled system is designed by introducing a new compartment (the population in an infection-free region) in the uncontrolled system to capture the removal of susceptible population from the infected region to an infection free region. By performing numerical simulations, our study shows that using Z-control mechanism, the removal of susceptible to an infection free region can effectively achieve a predetermined disease prevalence. The removal rates required for achieving a specific reduction in infected population for different levels of disease endemicity are quantified. Furthermore, the global sensitivity analysis (PRCC) is also performed to have a more clear insights on the correlations of the control parameter with the model parameters.","Senapati, Abhishek; Panday, Pijush; Samanta, Sudip; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123846,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123846,Elsevier,10.1016/j.physa.2019.123846,15/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-15

1698,Anesthetic and surgical management of tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19,"Abstract Objective The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection causes severe respiratory dysfunction and has become an emergent issue for worldwide healthcare. Since COVID-19 spreads through contact and droplet infection routes, careful attention to infection control and surgical management is important to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Tracheostomy is an effective method to treat severe respiratory dysfunction with prolonged respiratory management and should be performed as a high-risk procedure Method The anesthetic and surgical considerations in this case involved difficult goals of the patient safety and the management of infection among health care workers. Our surgical procedure was developed based on the previous experiences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Results We described the management procedures for tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19, including the anesthesia preparation, surgical procedures, required medical supplies (a N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator, goggles, face shield, cap, double gloves, and a water-resistant disposable gown), and appropriate consultation with an infection prevention team. Conclusion Appropriate contact, airborne precautions, and sufficient use of muscle relaxants are essential for performing tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19.","Hiramatsu, Mariko; Nishio, Naoki; Ozaki, Masayuki; Shindo, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Katsunao; Yamamoto, Takanori; Fujimoto, Yasushi; Sone, Michihiko",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anl.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anl.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anl.2020.04.002,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

1700,Multi-sectorial research is paramount for preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases,"Abstract The social, economic and political consequences of emerging infectious disease (EID) may escape the sphere in which they first arise. In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.","Le Turnier, P.; Leport, C.; Martin, P.; Jadand, C.; Hoen, B.; Guégan, J.-F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. Objective We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. Methods Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. Result CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=−2.647, −2.171, P ˂0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, −2.177, P ˂0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=−0.068, −1.549, P ˂0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient=0.873, 0.734, P ˂0.001). Conclusion In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.","Wang, L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1706,Features of anosmia in COVID-19,"Abstract Background: Medical publications about anosmia with COVID-19 are scarce. We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients with anosmia between March 1 and March 17, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. Results: Fifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (±16) years; 67% were females and 37% were hospitalized. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (±1.6 [0-7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (±1.9 [1-8]) days after infection onset. The mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (±6.3 [1-21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 days. Conclusions: Anosmia was present in half of our European COVID-19 patients and was often associated with dysgeusia.","Klopfenstein, Timothée; Kadiane-Oussou, N’dri Juliette; Toko, Lynda; Royer, Pierre-Yves; Lepiller, Quentin; Gendrin, Vincent; Zayet, Souheil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medmal.2020.04.006,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

1710,Diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT?,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation. The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed. Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively). At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. Conclusion rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","Long, Chunqin; Xu, Huaxiang; Shen, Qinglin; Zhang, Xianghai; Fan, Bing; Wang, Chuanhong; Zeng, Bingliang; Li, Zicong; Li, Xiaofen; Li, Honglu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

Methods Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups (<18 years, 18–44 years, 45–59 years, ≥60 years) were compared. Results Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45–59 years and aged ≥60 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients <18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45–59 years, and ≥60 years, than in those aged <18 years, and aged 18–44 years. Conclusions Chest HRCT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are related to patient’s age, and HRCT signs may be milder in younger patients.","Chen, Zuhua; Fan, Hongjie; Cai, Jian; Li, Yunjiang; Wu, Baoliang; Hou, Yanchun; Xu, Shufeng; Zhou, Fei; Liu, Yongguang; Xuan, Weiling; Hu, Hongjie; Sun, Jihong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
1712,Imaging of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Chinese Expert Consensus Statement,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, mainly causing inflammatory lesions in the lungs, and can also cause damage to the intestine and liver. The rapid spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has posed complex challenges to global public health. Early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment are the most effective means of prevention and control. At present, the epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection has tended to be controlled in China, and it is still in a period of rapid rise in much of the world. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of coronavirus nucleic acids, but imaging has an important role in the detection of lung lesions, stratification, evaluation of treatment strategies, and differentiation of mixed infections. This Chinese expert consensus statement summarizes the imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia and may help radiologists across the world to understand this disease better.","Yang, Qi; Liu, Qiang; Xu, Haibo; Lu, Hong; Liu, Shiyuan; Li, Hongjun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109008,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

1714,"Early CT features and temporal lung changes in COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Abstract Purpose To analyse the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) early imaging features and the changing trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Materials and Methods Forty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. Results The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13% [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57% [32/46]) were found. Other ﬁndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calciﬁcation or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45%). At 22-31 days, the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients(28.57%). Conclusion The typical early CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are ground-glass opacity, and located peripheral or subpleural location, and with supply pulmonary artery dilation. Reticulation was evident after the 2nd week and persisted in half of patients evaluated in 4 weeks after the onset. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible ﬁbrosis.","Hu, Qiongjie; Guan, Hanxiong; Sun, Ziyan; Huang, Lu; Chen, Chong; Ai, Tao; Pan, Yueying; Xia, Liming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109017,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
1715,Evaluation of a PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry platform for detection and identification of fungal pathogens directly from prospectively collected bronchoalveolar lavage specimens,"Abstract The incidence of invasive fungal infections is on the rise worldwide due to the growth of the immunocompromised population. We report here the use of a diagnostic assay that utilizes a universal extraction method, broad spectrum PCR amplification and analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to detect and identify more than 200 pathogenic fungi directly from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in less than 8 hours. In this study, we describe both analytical and clinical performance of the assay, when run with prospectively collected clinical BAL specimens. In 146 patients with probable and possible fungal infections defined by EORTC/MSG (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group) criteria, the PCR/ESI-MS assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 76.4–96.9%) and a specificity of 82.3% (95% CI: 74.2–88.2%). This data demonstrates the utility of a non-culture based broad fungal targets molecular diagnostic tool for rapid and accurate diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in patients at risk of developing fungal diseases.","Jia, Bei; Lovari, Robert; Miller, Heather; Metzgar, David; Massire, Christian; Carolan, Heather; Toleno, Donna; D'Alessio, Franco; Rothman, Richard; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Zhang, Sean X.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,Elsevier,10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,15/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-15

First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become host or vectors of virus transmission.

In the midst of a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease, reality-based considerations comprise an important starting point for formulating clinical management pathways. The aim of these “crisis-driven” recommendations is (1) to ensure appropriate and timely treatment of SHD patients, (2) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare workers, and (3) to limit resource utilization under conditions of constraint. While the degree of disruption to usual practice will vary across the United States and elsewhere, we hope that early experiences from a Heart Team operating in the current global epicenter of COVID-19 may prove useful for others adapting their practice in advance of local surges of COVID-19.","Chung, Christine J.; Nazif, Tamim M.; Wolbinski, Mariusz; Hakemi, Emad; Lebehn, Mark; Brandwein, Russell; Rezende, Carolina Pinheiro; Doolittle, James; Rabbani, Leroy; Uriel, Nir; Schwartz, Allan; Biviano, Angelo; Wan, Elaine; Hathaway, Lisa; Hahn, Rebecca; Khalique, Omar; Hamid, Nadira; Ng, Vivian; Patel, Amisha; Vahl, Torsten; Kirtane, Ajay; Bapat, Vinayak; George, Isaac; Leon, Martin B.; Kodali, Susheel K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.009,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

1726,Clinical Implications of SARS-Cov2 Interaction with Renin Angiotensin System,"Abstract SARS-CoV2 host cell infection is mediated by the binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis downregulation, increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.","Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.028,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

In order to ensure provider safety, maximize efficiency, and optimize patient outcomes, health systems need to be agile. Critical care cardiologists may be uniquely positioned to treat the numerous respiratory and cardiovascular complications of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and support clinicians without critical care training who may be suddenly asked to care for critically ill patients. This manuscript draws upon the experiences of colleagues from heavily impacted regions of the United States and Europe as well as lessons learned from military mass casualty medicine. We offer pragmatic suggestions on how to implement scalable models for critical care delivery, cultivate educational tools for team training, and embrace technologies such as telemedicine to enable effective collaboration despite social distancing imperatives.","Katz, Jason N.; Sinha, Shashank S.; Alviar, Carlos L.; Dudzinski, David M.; Gage, Ann; Brusca, Samuel B.; Flanagan, M.

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, and of those with preexisting thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bikdeli, Behnood; Madhavan, Mahesh V.; Jimenez, David; Chuich, Taylor; Dreyfus, Isaac; Driggin, Elissa; Nigoghossian, Caroline Der; Ageno, Walter; Madjid, Mohammad; Guo, Yutao; Tang, Liang V.; Hu, Yu; Giri, Jay; Cushman, Mary; Quéré, Isabelle; Dimakakos, Evangelos P.; Gibson, C.

1730,Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The worldwide pandemic caused by the novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in a new and lethal disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although there is an association between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, the majority of patients who need cardiovascular care for the management of ischemic heart disease may not be infected with COVID-19. The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a ST-elevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.","Mahmud, Ehtisham; Dauerman, Harold L.; Welt, Frederick GP.; Messenger, John C.; Rao, Sunil V.; Grines, Cindy; Mattu, Amal; Kirtane, Ajay J.; Jauhar, Rajiv; Meraj, Perwaiz; Rokos, Ivan C.; Rumsfeld, John S.; Henry, Timothy D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.039,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.039,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. Conclusion This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","Chavez, Summer; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex; Liang, Stephen Y.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

1738,Are loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators safe during chest compression? A simulation study,"Abstract Background The application of appropriate personal protective equipment for respiratory protection to health care workers is a cornerstone for providing safe healthcare in emergency departments. We investigated the protective effect and usefulness of loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compression. Methods This was a single-center simulation study performed from May 2019 to July 2019 in a tertiary hospital. We measured the concentrations of ambient aerosol and particles inside the loose-fitting PAPR during chest compression, and this ratio was set as the simulated workplace protecting factor (SWPF). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulations, the assigned protection factor (APF) of loose-fitting PAPRs is 25. Thus, the loose-fitting PAPRs were assumed to have a protective effect when the SWPF were ≥ 250 (APF × 10). We measured the SWPF of PAPR in real time during chest compression and also investigated the problems encountered during its use. Results Ninety-one participants (median age 29 [interquartile range (IQR): 26–32] years; 74% female) completed the simulation. None of the participants failed with SWPF below 250 during three sessions of chest compression. The median (IQR) values of SWPF at three cycles were 17,063 (10,145-26,373), 15,683 (9477-32,394), and 16,960 (7695-27,279). There was no disconnection of equipment or mechanical failures during chest compression. In addition, most participants (83%) replied that they rarely or never experienced difficulty in verbal communication and felt that the loose-fitting PAPR was comfortable. Conclusions The loose-fitting PAPRs provided sufficient respiratory protection without disturbances during chest compression.","Park, Soo Hyun; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Lee, Guntak; Park, Jong Eun; Kim, Taerim; Shin, Tae Gun; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon; Kim, Seonwoo; Yoon, Hee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment. However, identifying features atypical for COVID-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of Computed Tomography Angiography among these patients. Hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13% of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among COVID-19 infections. Additionally, the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography (EKG) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with COVID-19 infections.","Casey, Kyla; Iteen, Alexander; Nicolini, Reese; Auten, Jonathan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.011,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

As such, EDs must be able to reorganize and reformat operations to meet the changing needs and staggering patient volume. This paper addresses ways to adapt departmental operations to better manage in times of elevated disease burden, specifically identifying areas of intervention to help limit crowding and spread. Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.","Whiteside, Tess; Kane, Erin; Aljohani, Bandar; Alsamman, Marya; Pourmand, Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.032,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1754,Pharmacotherapy in COVID-19; A narrative review for emergency providers,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines. With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. Objectives This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords “COVID 19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “treatment.” All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. Discussion There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Glucocorticoids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. Conclusion There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.","Mehta, Nikita; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Alkindi, Nour; Ali Pourmand, ",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.035,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.035,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1758,Cardiac injury is associated with mortality and critically ill pneumonia in COVID-19: A meta-analysis,"Abstract Background In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. Definition of cardiac injury follows that of the included studies, which includes highly sensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnl) >99th percentile.The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were ARDS, the need for ICU care, and severe COVID-19. ARDS and severe COVID-19 were defined per the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) of COVID-19. Results There were a total of 2389 patients from 13 studies. This meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (RR 7.95 [5.12, 12.34], p < 0.001; I2: 65%). Cardiac injury was associated with higher need for ICU care (RR 7.94 [1.51, 41.78], p = 0.01; I2: 79%), and severe COVID-19 (RR 13.81 [5.52, 34.52], p < 0.001; I2: 0%). The cardiac injury was not significant for increased risk of ARDS (RR 2.57 [0.96, 6.85], p = 0.06; I2: 84%). The level of hs-cTnI was higher in patients with primary + secondary outcome (mean difference 10.38 pg/mL [4.44, 16.32], p = 0.002; I2: 0%).

1759,Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study,"Abstract Objective The purpose of this study was to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 from those of other chest infectious diseases and evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged >18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests. The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups. Results A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative. The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively. The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P < .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%. Conclusions The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.","Miao, Congliang; Jin, Mengdi; Miao, Li; Yang, Xinying; Huang, Peng; Xiong, Huanwen; Huang, Peijie; Zhao, Qi; Du, Jiang; Hong, Jiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.051,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

As reported at previous Thredbo Conferences, this system has had several iterations and a number of failures, with one franchise (for the East Coast) having failed three times. This paper will use national level and operator specific data provided by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to review recent key trends in rail demand and supply. It will extend an existing modelling framework to determine the costs and benefits of rail franchising at the national level. It will also undertake case studies of two franchises, for the East Coast and South West. In advance of the on-going Williams Review, policy prescriptions will be suggested for both the commercial and the social railway with particular reference to contract specifications.","Preston, John; Bickel, Charles",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100846,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100846,Elsevier,10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100846,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19. The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views. It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented. This paper contributes to literature by understanding the human-technology relationship, and offers five practical observations for controlling virus transmissions during pandemics.","Kummitha, Rama Krishna Reddy",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2020.101481,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2020.101481,Elsevier,10.1016/j.giq.2020.101481,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

All sectors of the U.S economy have been significantly impacted including physicians. Physician groups of all specialties and sizes have experienced the financial impact of the pandemic. Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to handle emergencies and cover the cost of the disruption. However, many Vascular Surgeons are under great financial pressure because of postponement of all non-emergency procedures. The Federal Government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some expenses and loss of revenue. It is more than likely that unless the public health emergency subsides significantly, many practices will suffer dire consequences without additional financial assistance. We attempt to provide a concise listing of such programs and resources available to assist Vascular Surgeons who are small businesses in accessing these opportunities.","Satiani, Bhagwan; Zigrang, Todd A.; Bailey–Wheaton, Jessica L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.482,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.482,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.482,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
1787,Acute limb ischemia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,"Objectives The aim of our study is to describe the incidence and characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes of patients presenting and treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) in patients with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Methods This is a single center, observational cohort study. Data of all patients tested positive with COVID-19 and presented with ALI vascular diseases requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database. For this series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (<30 days) re-occlusion, or major amputation or death ≤24 hours. Primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (≤30 days) and late survival (≥30 days), postoperative (≤ 30 days) complications, and limb salvage. Results We evaluated 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19. Considering the period January-to-March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly higher than 2019 [23/141 (16.3%) vs. 3/163 (1.8%), P < 0.001)]. There were 18 (90%) male and 2 female patients. Mean age was 75 years ± 9 (range, 62-95). All patients had already been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Operative treatment was performed in 17 (85%) patients. Revascularization was successful in 12/17 (70.6%) patients. Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.622), no patients receiving intravenous heparin required reintervention. There were 8 (40%) in-hospital mortalities. Age was significantly higher in those who died (years, 81 ± 10 vs. 71 ± 5, P = 0.008). The use of continued postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.042). Conclusions In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardia region. Successful revascularization was lower than expected which we hypothesize is due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state. The use of prolonged systemic heparin may improve surgical treatment efficacy as well as improve limb salvage and overall mortality.","Bellosta, Raffaello; Luzzani, Luca; Natalini, Giuseppe; Pegorer, Matteo Alberto; Attisani, Luca; Cossu, Luisa Giuseppina; Ferrandina, Camillo; Fossati, Alessandro; Conti, Elena; Bush, Ruth L.; Piffaretti, Gabriele",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.483,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.483,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jvs.2020.04.483,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1789,Unpacking the black box: How to promote citizen engagement through government social media during the COVID-19 crisis,"Abstract During times of public crises, governments must act swiftly to communicate crisis information effectively and efficiently to members of the public; failure to do so will inevitably lead citizens to become fearful, uncertain and anxious in the prevailing conditions. This pioneering study systematically investigates how Chinese central government agencies used social media to promote citizen engagement during the COVID-19 crisis. Using data scraped from ‘Healthy China’, an official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China, we examine how citizen engagement relates to a series of theoretically relevant factors, including media richness, dialogic loop, content type and emotional valence. Results show that media richness negatively predicts citizen engagement through government social media, but dialogic loop facilitates engagement. Information relating to the latest news about the crisis and the government's handling of the event positively affects citizen engagement through government social media. Importantly, all relationships were contingent upon the emotional valence of each Weibo post.","Chen, Qiang; Min, Chen; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Ge; Ma, Xiaoyue; Evans, Richard",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106380,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106380,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106380,30/09/2020,NA,NA,2020-09-30

1803,Occupational Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Burns Treatment During the COVID-19 Epidemic: Specific Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol,"ABSTRACT Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results. As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50%) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.","Huang, Zhifeng; Zhuang, Donglin; Xiong, Bing; Deng, David Xingfei; Li, Hanhua; Lai, Wen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110176,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110176,Elsevier,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110176,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
1804,New understanding of the damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside the respiratory system,"Abstract Since early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown coronavirus infection were identified in Wuhan, China, and many additional cases were identified in other regions of China and in other countries within 3 months. Currently, more than 80,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, including more than 3,000 deaths. The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control. On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems. In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Yuhao; Geng, Xiuchao; Tan, Yanli; Li, Qiang; Xu, Can; Xu, Jianglong; Hao, Liangchao; Zeng, Zhaomu; Luo, Xianpu; Liu, Fulin; Wang, Hong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110195,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110195,Elsevier,10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110195,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framework and recommendations in this document will provide crucial guidance for clinicians and policy makers on the management of coronary and structural procedures in the CCL as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates and eventually abates.","Wood, David A.; Sathananthan, Janarthanan; Gin, Ken; Mansour, Samer; Ly, Hung Q.; Quraishi, Ata-ur-Rehman; Lavoie, Andrea; Lutchmedial, Sohrab; Nosair, Mohamed; Bagai, Akshay; Bainey, Kevin R.; Boone, Robert H.; Liu, Shuangbo; Krahn, Andrew; Virani, Sean; Mehta, Shamir R.; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Velianou, James L.; Dehghani, Payam; Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Asgar, Anita W.; Virani, Alice; Welsh, Robert C.; Webb, John G.; Cohen, Eric A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

1811,Management and Treatment of COVID-19: The Chinese Experience,"Abstract With over 1,800,000 cases and 110,000 deaths globally, COVID-19 is one of worst infectious disease outbreaks in history. The objective of this paper is to critically review the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience regarding COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hebei and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and non-essential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. While some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers and contacts, and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organized, proactive and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.","Peng, Fujun; Tu, Lei; Yang, Yongshi; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Hu, Qinyong; Cao, Feng; Jiang, Taijiao; Sun, Jinlyu; Xu, Guogang; Chang, Christopher",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.010,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
1812,An In-hospital Pathway for Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Initial Experience under Real-world Suboptimal Conditions,"Unstructured Abstract In Lombardy (Italy), due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need to manage cardiovascular emergencies, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with appropriate standards of care and dedicated preventive measures and pathways against the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this reason, the Government of Lombardy decided to centralize the treatment of ACS patients in a limited number of centers, including our University Cardiology Institute that in the last four weeks became a cardiovascular emergency referral center in a regional hub and spoke system. Thus, we rapidly developed a customized pathway in order to allocate patients to the appropriate hospital ward, and treat them according to the ACS severity and the risk of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We present here a protocol dedicated to ACS patients adopted in our center since March 13th 2020 and our initial experience in the management of ACS patients during the first four weeks of its use. Certainly, the protocol has room for further improvement as everyone's experience grows, but we hope that it could be a starting point, adaptable to different realities and local resources.","Cosentino, Nicola; Assanelli, Emilio; Merlino, Luca; Mazza, Mario; Bartorelli, Antonio L.; Marenzi, Giancarlo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.011,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, the majority of Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This “flattening of the curve” has inevitably prompted discussions around re-opening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions and resuming non-urgent health care delivery.","Hassan, Ansar; Arora, Rakesh C.; Lother, Sylvain A.; Adams, Corey; Bouchard, Denis; Cook, Richard; Gunning, Derek; Lamarche, Yoan; Malas, Tarek; Moon, Michael; Ouzounian, Maral; Rao, Vivek; Rubens, Fraser; Tremblay, Philippe; Whitlock, Richard; Moss, Emmanuel; Légaré, Jean-François",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.04.030,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1817,Immunofluorescence and molecular diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus in the naturally infected young cattle and buffaloes from India,"Abstract Pneumonia in bovines is a multifactorial disease manifestation leading to heavy economic losses. Infections of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPI-3) are among the important contributing factors for the development of pneumonia in young animals. These viral agents either primarily cause pneumonia or predispose animals to the development of pneumonia. Although, the role of BRSV and BPI-3 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia is well established, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV and BPI-3 from Indian cattle and buffaloes suffering from pneumonia. In the present investigation, we performed postmortem examinations of 406 cattle and buffaloes which were below twelve months of age. Out of 406 cases, twelve (2.95%) cases were positive for BRSV and fifteen (3.69%) cases were positive for BPI-3, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen having intracytoplasmic inclusions. The BRSV antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. In fifteen cases where BPI-3 was detected, bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the majority of cases with thickened alveolar septa by mild macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type-II pneumocytes and bronchiolar necrosis along with syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusions in the majority of cases were observed. The BPI-3 antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. RT-PCR amplicons of BRSV and BPI-3 obtained were sequenced and their analysis showed homology with already available sequences in the NCBI database. It is the first report of detection of BRSV and BPI-3 from pneumonic cases by RT-PCR and d-FAT from cattle and buffaloes of India, indicating the need for more epidemiological studies.","Kamdi, Bhupesh; Singh, Rajendra; Singh, Vidya; Singh, Shailendra; Kumar, Pawan; Singh, Karam Pal; George, Neethu; Dhama, Kuldeep",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
1818,Lithium chloride confers protection against viral myocarditis via suppression of coxsackievirus B3 virus replication,"Abstract Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a type of inflammation affecting myocardial cells caused by viral infection and has been an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) worldwide. Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl's antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.","Zhao, Yinxia; Yan, Kepeng; Wang, Yanqi; Cai, Jiamin; Wei, Lin; Li, Shuijun; Xu, Wei; Li, Min",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31
1819,Shell disorder analysis predicts greater resilience of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outside the body and in body fluids,"Abstract The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

1820,"Etiology and genetic evolution of canine coronavirus circulating in five provinces of China, during 2018–2019","Abstract As the outbreaks of COVID-19 in worldwide, coronavirus has once again caught the attention of people. Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV–I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions. In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.","He, Hai-Jian; Zhang, Wenyan; Liang, Jiawei; Lu, Meng; Wang, Ruyi; Li, Gairu; He, Jia-Wei; Chen, Jun; Chen, Jun; Xing, Gang; Chen, Ye",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104209,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104209,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104209,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

1823,The Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic by the Arthroplasty Divisions at Two Academic Referral Centers,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread changes across all of healthcare. The impacts on the delivery of orthopaedic services has been challenged as a result. In order to ensure and provide for adequate health care resources in terms of hospital capacity, personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), service lines such as adult reconstruction and lower limb arthroplasty have stopped or substantially limited elective surgeries and have been forced to re-engineer care processes for a high-volume of patients. Herein, we summarize the similar approaches by two arthroplasty divisions in high volume academic referral centers in 1) the cessation of elective surgeries, 2) workforce restructuring, 3) phased delivery of outpatient and inpatient care, and 4) educational restructuring.","Pelt, Christopher E.; Campbell, Kevin L.; Gililland, Jeremy M.; Anderson, Lucas A.; Peters, Christopher L.; Barnes, C.

1824,"The Past, Present, and Future of Orthopaedic Education: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic","Abstract The COVID-19 global pandemic has upended nearly every medical discipline, dramatically impacted patient care, and has had far-reaching effects on surgeon education. In many areas of the country, elective orthopaedic surgery has completely stopped to ensure that resources are available for the critically ill and to minimize the spread of disease. COVID-19 is forcing many around the world to reevaluate existing processes and organizations and adapt to carry out business, of which medicine and education are not immune. The majority of national and international orthopaedic conferences, training programs, and workshops have been postponed or canceled, and we are now critically evaluating the delivery of education to our colleagues as well as residents and fellows. This manuscript describes the evolution of orthopaedic education and significant paradigm shifts necessary to continue to teach ourselves and the future leaders of our noble profession.","Stambough, Jeffrey B.; Curtin, Brian M.; Gililland, Jeremy M.; Guild, George N.; Kain, Michael S.; Karas, Vasili; Keeney, James A.; Plancher, Kevin D.; Moskal, Joseph T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.032,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1825,Helmet Modification to PPE with 3D Printing During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Duke University Medical Center: A Novel Technique,"Abstract Care for patients during COVID-19 poses challenges that require the protection of staff with recommendations that health care workers wear at minimum, an N95 mask or equivalent while performing an aerosol-generating procedure with a face shield. The United States faces shortages of personal protective equipment, and surgeons who use loupes and headlights have difficulty using these in conjunction with face shields. Most arthroplasty surgeons use surgical helmet systems, but in the current pandemic, many hospitals have delayed elective arthroplasty surgeries and the helmet systems are going unused. As a result, the authors have begun retrofitting these arthroplasty helmets to serve as personal protective equipment (PPE). The purpose of this paper is to outline the conception, design, donning technique, and safety testing of these arthroplasty helmets being re-purposed as PPE.","Erickson, Melissa M.; Richardson, Eric S.; Hernandez, Nicholas M.; Bobbert, Dana W.; Gall, Ken; Fearis, Paul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.035,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.035,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1826,Educating Surgeons to Educate Patients About the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The spring of 2020 has been a trying time for the global medical community as it has faced the latest pandemic, COVID-19. This contagious and lethal virus has impacted patients and health care workers alike. Elective surgeries have been suspended, and the very core of our health care system is being strained. The following brief communication reviews pertinent details about the virus, delaying elective surgeries, and what patients can do during this time. The goal is to disseminate factual data that surgeons can then use to educate their patients.","Saxena, Arjun; Bullock, Matthew; Danoff, Jonathan R.; Rodd, Denise Smith; Fischer, Stuart J.; Stronach, Ben M.; Levine, Brett R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.037,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.037,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1827,Economic Recovery After the COVID-19 Pandemic: Resuming Elective Orthopedic Surgery and Total Joint Arthroplasty,"Abstract Background The economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis are not like anything the U.S. health care system has ever experienced. Methods As we begin to emerge from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to plan the sustainable resumption of elective procedures. We must first ensure the safety of our patients and surgical staff. It must be a priority to monitor the availability of supplies for the continued care of patients suffering from COVID-19. As we resume elective orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty, we must begin to reduce expenses by renegotiating vendor contracts, use ambulatory surgery centers and hospital outpatient departments in a safe and effective manner, adhere to strict evidence-based and COVID-19–adjusted practices, and incorporate telemedicine and other technology platforms when feasible for health care systems and orthopedic groups to survive economically. Results The return to normalcy will be slow and may be different than what we are accustomed to, but we must work together to plan a transition to a more sustainable health care reality which accommodates a COVID-19 world. Conclusion Our goal should be using these lessons to achieve a healthy and successful 2021 fiscal year.","O’Connor, Casey M.; Anoushiravani, Afshin A.; DiCaprio, Matthew R.; Healy, William L.; Iorio, Richard",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.038,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.038,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
1828,Personal Protective Equipment: Current Best Practices for Orthopaedic Teams,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is challenging healthcare providers across the world. Current best practices for personal protective equipment (PPE) during this time are rapidly evolving and fluid due to the novel and acute nature of the pandemic and the dearth of high-level evidence. Routine infection control practices augmented by airborne precautions are paramount when treating the COVID-19 positive patient. Best practices for PPE use in patients who have unknown COVID-19 status are a highly charged and emotional issue. The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources. This article also explores the concerns of surgeons regarding possible transmission to their own family members as a result of caring for COVID-19 patients.","Fillingham, Yale A.; Grosso, Matthew J.; Yates, Adolph J.; Austin, Matthew S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.046,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.046,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1829,Digital Orthopaedics. A Glimpse into the Future in The Midst of a Pandemic,"Abstract Background The response to COVID-19 catalyzed the adoption and integration of digital health tools into the healthcare delivery model for musculoskeletal patients. The change, suspension or relaxation of Medicare and federal guidelines enabled the rapid implementation of these technologies. The expansion of payment models for virtual care facilitated its rapid adoption. The authors aim to provide several examples of digital health solutions utilized to manage orthopaedic patients during the pandemic and discuss what features of these technologies are likely to continue to provide value to patients and clinicians following its resolution. Conclusion The widespread adoption of new technologies enabling providers to care for patients remotely has the potential to permanently change the expectations of all stakeholders about the way care is provided in orthopaedics. The new era of Digital Orthopaedics will see a gradual and non-disruptive integration of technologies that support the patient’s journey through the successful management of their musculoskeletal disease.","Bini, Stefano A.; Schilling, Peter L.; Patel, Shaun P.; Kalore, Niraj V.; Ast, Michael; Maratt, Joseph; Schuett, Dustin; Lawrie, Charles M.; Chung, Christopher; Steele, G.

The cessation of elective surgery, enacted in mid-March and necessary to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, would surely challenge the solvency of many of our members’ practices. While our advocacy efforts discussed below have helped, clearly more relief is needed. Fortunately, our mitigation efforts have led to a “flattening of the curve” and discussions have begun on when, where, and how to safely start elective surgery again.","Huddleston, James I.; Iorio, Richard; Bosco, Joseph A.; Kerr, Joshua M.; Bolognesi, Michael P.; Lowry Barnes, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.050,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.050,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.050,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1832,Resource Re-Allocation During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Suburban Hospital System: Implications for Outpatient Hip and Knee Arthroplasty,"Abstract The COVID pandemic of 2020 has emerged as a global threat to patients, healthcare providers and to the global economy. Due to this particular novel and highly infectious strain of coronavirus, the rapid community spread and clinical severity of the subsequent respiratory syndrome created a substantial strain on hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. The rapid surge of patients presenting over a small time period for emergent clinical care, admission to the hospital and intensive care units with many requiring mechanically assisted ventilators for respiratory support demonstrated the potential to overwhelm healthcare workers, hospitals and healthcare systems. The purpose of our article is to describe an effective system for re-deployment of healthcare supplies, resources and personnel to hospitals within a suburban academic hospital system to optimize the care of COVID patients, while treating orthopaedic patients in an equally ideal setting to maximize their surgical and clinical care. This article will provide a particular focus on the current and future role of a specialty hip and knee hospital and its partnering ambulatory surgery center in the context of an outpatient arthroplasty program.","Michael Meneghini, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.051,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.051,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1833,Understanding Antibody Testing for COVID-19,"Abstract The orthopedic community has seen the COVID-19 pandemic decimate elective surgical volumes in most geographies. Patients and essential workers, such as healthcare providers, remain rightfully concerned about how to appropriately begin to return to work and community activity in a safe and responsible manner. Many believe that testing for the presence of antibodies on a widespread scale could help drive evidence-based decision making, both on an individual and societal scale. Much information, and an equal amount of misinformation, has been produced on antibody testing. Education about the role and science of such testing is critically important for programs to be effectively understood and managed.","Jacofsky, David; Jacofsky, Emilia M.; Jacofsky, Marc",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.055,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
1834,How Has COVID-19 affected Our Orthopaedic Implant Industry Partners? Implications for the Surgeon-Industry Relationship in 2020 and Beyond,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching societal and financial consequences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS Industry Partners and the Surgeon-Industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the 2nd half of 2020. Methods AAHKS Industry Partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS Member Surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. Results AAHKS Industry Partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for Regional, ‘Other National,’ and AAHKS Annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30% respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on Site of Service/Outpatient TJA and Covid-19 related Safety Measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40%, 60% respectively). Discussion The COVID-19 Pandemic has altered the orthopaedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS Industry Partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with and increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19 related safety measures were significant. Articulating optimal mechanisms to aid Industry in supporting surgeons with different practice models to meet demand during the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be critical.","Warth, Lucian C.; Noiseux, Nicolas O.; Duncan, Stephen T.; Bradley Daines, S.; Mahoney, Craig R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.063,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the U.S. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multihospital health care system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the health care system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multifaceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, intensive care units, and acute care services. The strategy focuses on key content areas, including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members. Conclusion Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our health care systems. We share our experiences of developing such a strategy to help other institutions conduct and adapt such strategies more quickly.","Fausto, James; Hirano, Lianne; Lam, Daniel; Mehta, Amisha; Mills, Blair; Owens, Darrell; Perry, Elizabeth; Curtis, J.

1848,Palliative Care Pandemic Pack: a Specialist Palliative Care Service response to planning the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Abstract: Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic. Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations. Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid up-skilling of non-specialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care. It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively.","Ferguson, Lana; Barham, Deborah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
1849,Crisis Symptom Management and Patient Communication Protocols Are Important Tools for All Clinicians Responding to COVID-19,"Abstract Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While palliative care specialists have training in these skills, many front-line clinicians from other specialties do not. It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.","Bowman, Brynn A.; Esch, Andrew E.; Back, Anthony L.; Marshall, Nadine",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
1850,The role and response of palliative care and hospice services in epidemics and pandemics: a rapid review to inform practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity. This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to ‘systems’ (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), ‘staff’ (deployment, skill mix, resilience), ‘space’ (community provision, use of technology) and ‘stuff’ (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non-specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.","Etkind, Simon N.; Bone, Anna E.; Lovell, Natasha; Cripps, Rachel L.; Harding, Richard; Higginson, Irene J.; Sleeman, Katherine E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

1852,"Symptom Cluster of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China","Abstract Objective In treating highly infectious COVID-19 pneumonia, ICU nurses face a high risk of developing somatic symptom disorder (SSD). The present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of SSD of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia. The research results are expected to provide evidence for the establishment of a better management strategy. Methods This study enrolled a total of 140 ICU nurses who were selected by Jiangsu Province Hospital to work in Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China) on 3rd February 2020. A questionnaire “Somatic Symptom Disorders for ICU Nurses in Wuhan No.1 Hospital” was designed based on the “International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health” (ICF). Exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms, and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms. Results Five major symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation (31.4%), dyspnea (30.7%), nausea (21.4%), headache (19.3%), and dizziness (17.9%). In exploratory factor analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and pain (nausea, headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, chest-discomfort-and-palpitation). In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors. Conclusion The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters. Based on the characteristics of their SSDs, specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of ICU nurses.","Yifan, Tang; Ying, Liu; Chunhong, Gao; Jing, Song; Rong, Wang; Zhenyu, Li; Zejuan, Gu; Peihung, Liao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
1853,Rapid De-Escalation and Triaging Patients in Community-Based Palliative Care,"Abstract Context The COVID-19 pandemic created a rapid and unprecedented shift in our medical system. Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? Measures The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. Conclusions/Lessons Learned We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting. An understanding of infection risk, mutual consent between designated providers, patients, and their families are crucial to maintaining safety while delivering community-based palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tran, David; Lai, Steve; Salah, Ramy; Wong, Angela; Bryon, Jill; McKenna, Meghan; Chan, Yvonne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
1854,"Which Melbourne metropolitan areas are vulnerable to COVID-19 based on age, disability and access to health services? Using spatial analysis to identify service gaps and inform delivery","Abstract Ageing adults (65+) with disability are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and upon contracting, are a cohort most likely to require palliative care. Therefore, it is very important that health services - particularly health services providing palliative care - are proximately available. Treating the Melbourne metropolitan area as a case-study, a spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of ageing adults (65+) with disability, and high barriers to accessing primary health services. After, travel times from priority areas to (i) palliative medicine, and (ii) hospital services were calculated. The geographic dispersion of areas with people vulnerable to COVID-19 with poor access to palliative care and health services are clarified. Unique methods of health service delivery are required to ensure that vulnerable populations in under-serviced metropolitan areas receive prompt and adequate care. The spatial methodology employed can be implemented in different contexts to support evidence-based COVID-19 and pandemic palliative care service decisions.","Lakhani, Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
1855,Rapid Implementation of Inpatient Telepalliative Medicine Consultations during COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract As COVID-19 cases increase throughout the country and healthcare systems grapple with the need to decrease provider exposure and minimize personal protective equipment (PPE) use while maintaining high quality patient care, our specialty is called upon to consider new methods of delivering inpatient palliative care. Telepalliative medicine has been used to great effect in outpatient and home-based palliative care, but has had fewer applications in the inpatient setting. As we plan for decreased provider availability due to quarantine and redeployment and seek to reach increasingly isolated hospitalized patients in the face of COVID-19, the need for telepalliative medicine in the inpatient setting is now clear. We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of telepalliative medicine consultation for our inpatient palliative care teams and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for programs considering similar care models.","Humphreys, Jessi; Schoenherr, Laura; Elia, Giovanni; Saks, Naomi Tzril; Brown, Chelsea; Barbour, Susan; Pantilat, Steven Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.001,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1857,"A comparison of burnout frequency among oncology physicians and nurses working on the front lines and usual wards during the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China","Abstract Context The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China and has now spread worldwide. In the affected countries, physicians and nurses are under heavy workload conditions and are at high risk of infection. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of burnout between physicians and nurses on the front line and those working in usual wards. Methods A survey with 49 questions total was administered to 220 medical staff members from the COVID-19 front lines and usual wards, with a ratio of 1:1. General information such as age, gender, marriage status, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Medical Personnel (MBI), were gathered and compared. Results The group working on the front lines had a lower frequency of burnout (13% versus 39%, P < .0001), and were less worried about being infected compared to the usual ward group. Conclusion Compared to medical staff working on their usual wards for uninfected patients, medical staff working on the COVID-19 front line had a lower frequency of burnout. These results suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, both front line and usual ward staff should be considered when policies and procedures to support the well-being of health care workers are devised.","Wu, Yuan; Wang, Jun; Luo, Chenggang; Hu, Sheng; Lin, Xi; Anderson, Aimee E.; Bruera, Eduardo; Yang, Xiaoxin; Wei, Shaozhong; Qian, Yu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.008,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
1858,Grief During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Considerations for Palliative Care Providers,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to continue spreading widely across the globe throughout 2020. To mitigate the devastating impact of COVID-19, social distancing and visitor restrictions in health care facilities have been widely implemented. Such policies and practices, along with the direct impact of the spread of COVID-19, complicate issues of grief that are relevant to medical providers. We describe the relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic to anticipatory grief, disenfranchised grief, and complicated grief for individuals, families, and their providers. Furthermore, we provide discussion regarding countering this grief through communication, advance care planning, and self-care practices. We provide resources for health care providers, in addition to calling on palliative care providers to consider their own role as a resource to other specialties during this public health emergency.","Wallace, Cara L.; Wladkowski, Stephanie P.; Gibson, Allison; White, Patrick",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.012,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
1859,Family-Centered Care During the COVID-19 Era,"Abstract Family support is more, not less, important during crisis. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining public safety necessitates restricting the physical presence of families for hospitalized patients. In response, health systems must rapidly adapt family-centric procedures and tools to circumvent restrictions on physical presence. Strategies for maintaining family integrity must acknowledge clinicians’ limited time and attention to devote to learning new skills. Internet-based solutions can facilitate the routine, predictable, and structured communication which is central to family-centered care. But the reliance on technology may compromise patient privacy and exacerbate racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities for populations that lack access to reliable internet access, devices or technological literacy. We provide a toolbox of strategies for supporting family-centered inpatient care during physical distancing responsive to the current clinical climate. Innovations in the implementation of family involvement during hospitalizations may lead to long-term progress in the delivery of family-centered care.","Hart, Joanna L.; Turnbull, Alison E.; Oppenheim, Ian M.; Courtright, Katherine R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.017,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
1860,"Characteristics, symptom management and outcomes of 101 patients with COVID-19 referred for hospital palliative care","Abstract Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID-19 response but data are lacking. We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 in-patients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care. Patients (64 male, median [IQR] age 82 [72-89] years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 6 [2-10], Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status 20 [10-20]), were most frequently referred for end of life care or symptom control. Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1-12] days. Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23) and delirium (24). Fifty-eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion. Frequently used medicines (median-maximum dose/24h) were opioids (morphine, 10-30mg; fentanyl, 100-200mcg; alfentanil 500-1000 mcg) and midazolam (10-20mg). Infusions were assessed as at least partially effective for 40/58 patients, while 13 patients died before review. Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1–4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2–5] contacts across patient, family and clinicians. At March 30 2020, 75 patients had died, 13 been discharged back to team, home or hospice, and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care. Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID-19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working. Breathlessness and agitation are common but respond well to opioids and benzodiazepines. Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential. An international minimum dataset for palliative care would accelerate finding answers to new questions as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.","Lovell, Natasha; Maddocks, Matthew; Etkind, Simon N.; Taylor, Katie; Carey, Irene; Vora, Vandana; Marsh, Lynne; Higginson, Irene J.; Prentice, Wendy; Edmonds, Polly; Sleeman, Katherine E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.015,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1861,Convalescent Plasma: Therapeutic Hope or Hopeless Strategy in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,"Abstract As the world faces the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, extensive efforts have been applied to identify effective therapeutic agents. Convalescent plasma collected from recovered patients has been a therapeutic modality employed for over a hundred years for various infectious pathogens. Specifically, it has been used in the treatment of many viral infections with varying degrees of clinical efficacy. As we consider the use of convalescent plasma in the battle against this new strain of coronavirus, it is prudent to review what is known from past experiences. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to examine in detail studies of convalescent plasma used during previous viral outbreaks and pandemics with particular focus on hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, and other coronaviruses. The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population. By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.","Sullivan, H.

1865,Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: Methods and implications,"Abstract The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.","Yin, Changchuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.04.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.04.016,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.04.016,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
1866,Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study,"Abstract The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.","Kang, Lijun; Ma, Simeng; Chen, Min; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Bai, Hanping; Cai, Zhongxiang; Xiang Yang, Bing; Hu, Shaohua; Zhang, Kerang; Wang, Gaohua; Ma, Ci; Liu, Zhongchun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

Very recently, coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological diseases. It is reported that CoV can be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid.

Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider psychological resilience but also to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.","Kim, Sung-Wan; Su, Kuan-Pin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

Now, just eight years later, the program has been so successful in advancing the science of psychoneuroimmunology that it has expanded to the whole of Asia-Oceania. In 2017, PNIRS China became PNIRS Asia-Pacific . Between 2012 and 2019, this outreach affiliate of PNIRS organized seven symposia at major scientific meetings in China as well as nine others in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. This paper summarizes the remarkable growth of PNIRS Asia-Pacific . Here, regional experts who have been instrumental in organizing these PNIRS Asia-Pacific symposia briefly review and share their views about the past, present and future state of psychoneuroimmunology research in China, Taiwan, Australia and Japan. The newest initiative of PNIRS Asia-Pacific is connecting Asia-Pacific laboratories with those in Western countries through a simple web-based registration system. These efforts not only contribute to the efforts of PNIRS to serve a truly global scientific society but also to answer the imperative call of increasing diversity in our science.","Kelley, Keith W.; Peng, Yu-Ping; Liu, Quentin; Chang, Hui-Chih; Spencer, Sarah J.; Hutchinson, Mark R.; Shimada, Atsuyoshi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.026,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1880,Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Emily A.; Kohn, Jordan N.; Hong, Suzi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13

1883,A Longitudinal Study on the Mental Health of General Population during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China,"Abstract In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 second-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p<0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p>0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.","Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Choo, Faith N.; Tran, Bach; Ho, Roger; Sharma, Vijay K.; Ho, Cyrus",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
1884,"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Abstract Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Nicholas W.S.; Lee, Grace K.H.; Tan, Benjamin Y.Q.; Jing, Mingxue; Goh, Yihui; Ngiam, Nicholas J.H.; Yeo, Leonard L.L.; Ahmad, Aftab; Ahmed Khan, Faheem; Napolean Shanmugam, Ganesh; Sharma, Arvind K.; Komalkumar, R.N.; Meenakshi, P.V.; Shah, Kenam; Patel, Bhargesh; Chan, Bernard P.L.; Sunny, Sibi; Chandra, Bharatendu; Ong, Jonathan J.Y.; Paliwal, Prakash R.; Wong, Lily Y.H.; Sagayanathan, Renarebecca; Chen, Jin Tao; Ying Ng, Alison Ying; Teoh, Hock Luen; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Ho, Cyrus S.; Ho, Roger C.; Sharma, Vijay K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality. WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet. Thus, now more than ever, wider access to healthy foods should be a top priority and individuals should be mindful of healthy eating habits to reduce susceptibility to and long-term complications from COVID-19.","Butler, Michael J.; Barrientos, Ruth M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.040,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.040,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

1888,"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n=500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p<0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p<0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p=0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p=0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p=0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p=0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p=0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p=0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p=0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p=0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Moccia, Lorenzo; Janiri, Delfina; Pepe, Maria; Dattoli, Luigi; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Janiri, Luigi; Fiorillo, Andrea; Sani, Gabriele; Di Nicola, Marco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
1889,Current status of potential therapeutic candidates for the COVID-19 crisis,"Abstract As of April 15, 2020, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 1,870,000 individuals, posing an unprecedented threat to international health and the economy. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness.","Zhang, Jiancheng; Xie, Bing; Hashimoto, Kenji",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.046,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.046,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

1892,Is Returning to Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic Stressful? A Study on Immediate Mental Health Status and Psychoneuroimmunity Prevention Measures of Chinese Workforce,"Abstract This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. More than 95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p<0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p<0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Wanqiu; Hao, Fengyi; McIntyre, Roger S.; Jiang, Li; Jiang, Xiaojiang; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; Zhang, Zhisong; Lai, Andre; Ho, Roger; Tran, Bach; Ho, Cyrus; Tam, Wilson",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

1894,Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry,"Abstract This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.","Hao, Fengyi; Tan, Wanqiu; Jiang, Li; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; Jiang, Xiaojiang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Tran, Bach; Sun, Jiaqian; Zhang, Zhisong; Ho, Roger; Ho, Cyrus; Tam, Wilson",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

Loss, as a more encompassing theme, interweaves many aspects of people’s life in this challenging time. Failure to address the pressing needs of those experiencing loss and grief may result in poor mental and physical health.

1897,Ayurveda and COVID-19: where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Most patients with COVID-19 present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms, some patients present with atypical symptoms including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms. Here we present a series of four COVID-19 patients with acute stroke as a presenting symptom. Methods We searched the hospital databases for patients presenting with acute strokes and suspected COVID-19 features. All patients that had imaging confirmed strokes and PCR confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients admitted to the hospital with PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease whose hospital course was complicated with acute stroke while inpatient were excluded from the study. Retrospective patient data were obtained from electronic medical records. Informed consent was obtained. Results We identified four patients presenting with imaging confirmed acute strokes and PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course. Conclusions Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke. Stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and dawn appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient. Further studies are urgently needed for a comprehensive understanding of the neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system.","Avula, Akshay; Nalleballe, Krishna; Narula, Naureen; Sapozhnikov, Steven; Dandu, Vasuki; Toom, Sudhamshi; Glaser, Allison; Elsayegh, Dany",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.077,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.077,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.077,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

At the moment no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. Case report A 67-year old male patient, undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft six years before, was admitted to the Emergency Department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite. Conclusion Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID19 infection. In COVID19 patients with prosthetic graft an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.","Giacomelli, Elena; Dorigo, Walter; Fargion, Aaron; Calugi, Gianmarco; Cianchi, Giovanni; Pratesi, Carlo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.04.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.04.040,Elsevier,10.1016/j.avsg.2020.04.040,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1914,Development and evaluation of a rapid detection assay for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus based on reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification,"Abstract Rapid detection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is crucial for its control and surveillance. In this study, a rapid isothermal real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed for the detection of SFTSV. The detection limit at 95% probability was 241 copies per reaction. A test of 120 serum samples of suspected severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay was approximately 96.00% (95%CI: 80.46%–99.79%) and 98.95% (95% CI: 94.28%–99.95%), respectively; the kappa value was 0.9495 (P＜0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 87.50% of the different data points were located within the 95% limits of agreement, indicating a good correlation between the results from RT-RPA assays and those of RT-qPCR assays. In conclusion, the rapid and efficient RT-RPA assay can be a promising candidate for point-of-care detection method of SFTSV.","Zhou, Jingyu; Wang, Qiujing; Zhu, Lijun; Li, Shibo; Li, Wei; Fu, Yongfeng; Cheng, Xunjia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101580,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101580,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101580,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

However, PCR-based tests are still considered the “golden standard” for many clinical applications. Here, we designed a qPCR-based platform with fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide probes for assessing human gut microbiome composition. The system allows conducting qualitative and semiquantitative analysis for 12 prokaryotic taxa that are prevalent in the human gut and associated with diseases, diet, age and other factors. The platform was validated by comparing microbiome profile data obtained with two different methods - the platform and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing - across 42 stool samples. The test can form the basis for precise and cost-efficient microbiome assay for large-scale surveys including clinical trials with interventions related to diet and disease risks.","Kurina, Irina; Popenko, Anna; Klimenko, Natalia; Koshechkin, Stanislav; Chuprikova, Liubov; Filipenko, Maxim; Tyakht, Alexander; Alexeev, Dmitry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101570,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101570,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mcp.2020.101570,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1922,"Echo in Pandemic: Front Line Perspective, Expanding Role of Ultrasound and Ethics of Resource Allocation","Abstract The grave clinical context of the pandemic must be understood. Italy is immersed in COVID-19. Most of the world will soon follow. The United States currently has the most documented cases of COVID-19 of any nation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated acute cardiomyopathy is common in critical care patients and is associated with a high mortality. COVID-19 patients frequently require mechanical support for adequate oxygenation. A severe shortfall of ventilators is predicted. Of equal concern is the projected shortage of trained professionals required to care for patients on mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography is proving to be a valuable tool for identifying the pulmonary manifestations and progression of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound also facilitates successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography of the lung, pleura and diaphragm are easily mastered by experienced echocardiographers. Echocardiography has an established role for optimal fluid management and recognition of cardiac disease including SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy. Cardiologists, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and all providers should be prepared to commit their full spectrum of skills to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. We should also be prepared to collaborate and cross-train to expand professional services as necessary. During a declared health care crisis, providers must be familiar with the ethical principles, organizational structure, practical application, and gravity of limited resource allocation.","Drake, Daniel H.; De Bonis, Michele; Covella, Michele; Agricola, Eustachio; Zangrillo, Alberto; Zimmerman, Karen G.; Cobey, Frederick C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.echo.2020.04.007,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

1931,Recommendations for coronavirus infection in rheumatic diseases treated with biologic therapy,"Abstract The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.","Ceribelli, Angela; Motta, Francesca; De Santis, Maria; Ansari, Aftab A.; Ridgway, William M.; Gershwin, M.

1932,Can we use interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS)?,"Abstract The emergent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids, commonly utilized antiinflammatory agents, to treat COVID-19-induced CRS is controversial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-induced CRS, compare the CRS in COVID-19 with that in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and summarize the existing therapies for CRS. We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application.","Liu, Bingwen; Li, Min; Zhou, Zhiguang; Guan, Xuan; Xiang, Yufei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102452,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102452,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102452,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
1933,Assessing ACE2 expression patterns in lung tissues in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,"Abstract It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Li, Guoping; He, Xiang; Zhang, Lei; Ran, Qin; Wang, Junyi; Xiong, Anying; Wu, Dehong; Chen, Feng; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102463,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102463,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102463,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
1934,The anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs: Lessons from COVID-19,"Abstract The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed the world at a pandemic risk. Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization. This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection. Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect. The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Perricone, Carlo; Triggianese, Paola; Bartoloni, Elena; Cafaro, Giacomo; Bonifacio, Angelo F.; Bursi, Roberto; Perricone, Roberto; Gerli, Roberto",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
1935,Characteristics and prognostic factors of disease severity in patients with COVID-19: The Beijing experience,"Abstract COVID-19 has become one of the worst infectious disease outbreaks of recent times, with over 2.1 million cases and 120,000 deaths so far. Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3–85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function test including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality. In a binary logistic regression model, C-reactive protein level (OR 1.073, [CI, 1.013–1.136]; p = 0.017), CD8 T lymphocyte counts (OR 0.989, [CI, 0.979–1.000]; p = 0.043), and D-dimer (OR 5.313, [CI, 0.325–86.816]; p = 0.241) were independent predictors of disease severity.","Sun, Ying; Dong, Yanli; Wang, Lifeng; Xie, Huan; Li, Baosen; Chang, Christopher; Wang, Fu-sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102473,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102473,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102473,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
1936,Portable chest X-ray in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): A pictorial review,"Abstract/introduction As the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) progresses, many physicians in a wide variety of specialties continue to play pivotal roles in diagnosis and management. In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing. The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic.","Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

We find that initial CT findings of 4 patients were positive within one week after the onset of symptoms and 1 patient was negative before the onset of symptoms. Two asymptomatic patients had typical CT abnormalities. The initial CT imaging manifestations are mainly peripheral or subpleural ground-glass opacities and ground-glass with consolidation.

1940,Custom-made 3D-printed face masks in case of pandemic crisis situations with a lack of commercially available FFP2/3 masks,"Abstract In the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur. A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

1947,Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: Report of three cases and a review of literature,"ABSTRACT Background Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized. Objective This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 through three case reports and a literature review. Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Google search engines for original and review articles. Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included. Results Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review. Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies. The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred after the onset of respiratory symptoms or before COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions.

1948,"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients: A retrospective case study in three hospitals within Wuhan, China","Abstract Background Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010). Conclusions Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.

Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.","Baron, Sophie Alexandra; Devaux, Christian; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Rolain, Jean-Marc",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,13/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-13

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","Gautret, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Parola, Philippe; Hoang, Van Thuan; Meddeb, Line; Mailhe, Morgane; Doudier, Barbara; Courjon, Johan; Giordanengo, Valérie; Vieira, Vera Esteves; Dupont, Hervé Tissot; Honoré, Stéphane; Colson, Philippe; Chabrière, Eric; La Scola, Bernard; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]. At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.

1964,The cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of severe COVID-19 and Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist Tocilizumab may be the key to reduce the mortality,"Abstract Since December 2019, a viral pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has swept the world. Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19.

1966,Structural and molecular modelling studies reveal a new mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"ABSTRACT The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a worldwide pandemic. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111–158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.","Fantini, Jacques; Di Scala, Coralie; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are especially vulnerable to cluster outbreaks, since it is difficult to find facilities and healthcare personnel for their separate isolation care in a large outbreak situation. Although several drugs have been proposed as treatment regimens, there are no data on the effectiveness and safety of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. After a large COVID-19 exposure event in a LTCH in Korea, PEP using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was conducted to 211 persons including 189 patients and 22 careworkers, whose baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 were negative. PEP was completed in 184 (97.4%) patients and 21 (95.5%) careworkers without serious adverse events. At the end of 14 days of quarantine, follow-up PCR tests were all negative.

In this study, we found that DCI was positively correlated with incidence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.01, 95% [confidence interval, CI] = 1.00-1.02, p < 0.01). Higher correlation between mortality and DCI (mortality rate: r = 0.397, p = 0.018; mortality per 1,000,000 people: r = 0.0.428, p = 0.004) was observed than disease incidence. DCI remained statistically associated with mortality per 1,000,000 people after adjustment of Health Care Index (aRR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) or Healthcare Access and Quality Index (aRR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01-1.04, p < 0.01. Reducing DCI through strict infection control measures can help slow the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and further improve outcome in COVID-19 patients.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106001,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

1979,Exercise-induced immune system response: Anti-inflammatory status on peripheral and central organs,"Abstract A wide array of molecular pathways has been investigated during the past decade in order to understand the mechanisms by which the practice of physical exercise promotes neuroprotection and reduces the risk of developing communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases. While a single session of physical exercise may induce a transient imbalance of cell homeostasis, repeated physical exercise sessions will improve immunosurveillance and immunocompetence. Additionally, immune cells from the central nervous system will acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype, protecting central functions from age-induced cognitive decline. This review highlights the exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect on the prevention or treatment of common chronic clinical and experimental settings. It also suggests the use of pterins in biological fluids as sensitive biomarkers to follow the anti-inflammatory effect of physical exercise.","da Luz Scheffer, Débora; Latini, Alexandra",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165823,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165823,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbadis.2020.165823,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
1980,The rippled newsvendor: A new inventory framework for modeling supply chain risk severity in the presence of risk propagation,"Abstract How should managers take into account the propagation of supply chain disruptions and risks (i.e. the ripple effect) when they design their inventory policies? For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model – the ”Rippled Newsvendor” – with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and ”wear-and-tear” (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently.","Garvey, Myles D.; Carnovale, Steven",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,31/10/2020,NA,NA,2020-10-31
1981,"Operational resilience, disruption, and efficiency: Conceptual and empirical analyses","Abstract This research develops the notion of operational resilience and investigates its relationship with operational efficiency under differing conditions of operational disruption. Operational resilience is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of two theoretically distinct components (i.e., disruption absorption and recoverability), which are argued to have unique effects on operational efficiency under varying operational disruption conditions. The study's hypotheses are empirically tested on primary data from a sample of 259 firms in a sub-Saharan African economy. Using structural equation modeling as an analytical tool, the study finds that both disruption absorption and recoverability have positive effects on operational efficiency. Additionally, the study finds that while the effect of disruption absorption on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of high operational disruption, the effect of recoverability on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of low operational disruption. A major implication of these findings is that the nature of operational resilience and the disruption circumstances under which it is deployed shape its efficiency value, thus advancing knowledge on the nuances associated with how and when operational resilience influences operational efficiency.","Essuman, Dominic; Boso, Nathaniel; Annan, Jonathan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107762,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107762,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107762,30/11/2020,NA,NA,2020-11-30
1982,Initial impacts of global risk mitigation measures taken during the combatting of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract This paper presents an analysis of risk mitigation measures taken by countries around the world facing the current COVID-19 outbreak. In light of the current pandemic the authors collated and clustered (using harmonised terminology) the risk mitigation measures taken around the globe in the combat to contain, and since March 11 2020, to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known to cause the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This overview gathers lessons learnt, providing an update on the current knowledge for authorities, sectors and first responders on the effectiveness of said measures, and may allow enhanced prevention, preparedness and response for future outbreaks. Various measures such as mobility restrictions, physical distancing, hygienic measures, socio-economic restrictions, communication and international support mechanisms have been clustered and are reviewed in terms of the nature of the actions taken and their qualitative early-perceived impact. At the time of writing, it is still too premature to express the quantitative effectiveness of each risk mitigation cluster, but it seems that the best mitigation results are reported when applying a combination of voluntary and enforceable measures.","Bruinen de Bruin, Yuri; Lequarre, Anne-Sophie; McCourt, Josephine; Clevestig, Peter; Pigazzani, Filippo; Zare Jeddi, Maryam; Colosio, Claudio; Goulart, Margarida",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104773,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104773,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104773,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
1983,An approach to the photocatalytic mechanism in the TiO2-nanomaterials microorganism interface for the control of infectious processes,"Abstract The approach of this timely review considers the current literature that is focused on the interface nanostructure/cell-wall microorganism to understand the annihilation mechanism. Morphological studies use optical and electronic microscopes to determine the physical damage on the cell-wall and the possible cell lysis that confirms the viability and microorganism death. The key parameters of the tailoring the surface of the photoactive nanostructures such as the metal functionalization with bacteriostatic properties, hydrophilicity, textural porosity, morphology and the formation of heterojunction systems, can achieve the effective eradication of the microorganisms under natural conditions, ranging from practical to applications in environment, agriculture, and so on. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the microorganism/nanomaterial interface approach has rarely been conducted. The final remarks point the ideal photocatalytic way for the effective prevention/eradication of microorganisms, considering the resistance that the microorganism could develop without the appropriate regulatory aspects for human and ecosystem safety.","Rodríguez-González, Vicente; Obregón, Sergio; Patrón-Soberano, Olga A.; Terashima, Chiaki; Fujishima, Akira",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,05/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-05
1984,"Schinus terebenthifolius Raddi extracts: from sunscreen activity toward protection of the placenta to Zika virus infection, new uses for a well-known medicinal plant","Abstract Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi is a well-known medicinal plant native of South America. This species has demonstrated important biological activities such as antihypertensive and vasodilator, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, no studies have been, so far, reported with the fruits of S. terebinthifolius as a protector of the placenta against Zika virus infection and as sunscreen agents. The present study aimed to investigate new uses for the ethanolic fruit extracts of S. terebinthifolius, from fruits’peel (STPE) and from the whole fruits (STWFE). Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to several fetal malformations, such as microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. Thus, the potential of these natural extracts against ZIKV infection was evaluated, using an in vitro method. The photoprotective potential, determined by spectrometry, along with phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chemical composition of both extracts were also evaluated. The chemical composition of the extracts was evaluated by HPLC-UV / vis. The cytotoxicity of peel and whole fruit extracts in vero E6 cell lines, in placental cell lines and placental explant cultures were evaluated by the MTT assay. The infectivity of placental cells and explants was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the effects of extracts on ZIKV infection were investigated using HTR-8/SVneo cells, pre-treated with 100 μg mL-1 of STWFE for 1 h, and infected with MR766 (AD) or PE243 (EH) ZIKV strains. STFE and STWFE were well-tolerated by both placental-derived trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo as well as by term placental chorionic villi explants, which indicate absence of cytotoxicity in all analysed concentrations. Two strains of ZIKV were tested to access if pre-treatment of trophoblast cells with the STWFE would protect them against infection. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that STWFE extract greatly reduced ZIKV infection. The extracts were also photoprotective with SPF values equivalent to the standard, benzophenone-3. The formulations prepared in different concentrations of the extracts (5-10%) had shown maximum SPF values of 32.21. STWFE represents a potential natural mixture to be used in pregnancy in order to restrain placental infection by ZIKV and might potentially protect fetus against ZIKV-related malformations. The extracts exhibited photoprotective activity and some of the phenolic compounds, mainly resveratrol, catechin and epicatechin, are active ingredients in all assayed activities. The development of biotechnological/medical products, giving extra value to products from family farming, is expected, with strong prospects for success.","dos Santos Oliveira, Mônika Bezerra; Valentim, Iara Barros; dos Santos Rocha, Tauane; Santos, Jaqueline Correia; Nobre Pires, Keyla Silva; Lira Tanabe, Eloiza Lopes; Cruz Borbely, Karen Steponavicius; Borbely, Alexandre Urban; Fonseca Goulart, Marília Oliveira",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112503,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112503,Elsevier,10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112503,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. Methods We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Results Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. Conclusion COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.","Chang, Tu-Hsuan; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Chang, Luan-Yin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.007,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

Methods This study was conducted on 136 patients with COVID-19 in main district of Chongqing from Jan 25 to Feb 20, 2020. Data of patients included demographic, epidemiological, clinical features, chest radiographs of imported cases, local cases, second-generation cases and third-generation cases. Student's t-test was adopted for quantitative variables while Pearson Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Results The median age was 47 years and common symptoms of illness were cough (50.7%), fever (47.1%) and fatigue (14.0%). The time from contact symptomatic case to illness was 7.7 days, and 88 patients (64.7%) were cluster cases, radiological evidence found bilateral lung involvement was common (57.4%).Compared with the imported cases, the local cases were significantly older, the proportion of men is lower. There was higher proportion of cluster cases in local cases. Unlike imported cases, which fever was the dominant symptom, the local cases have more cough patients, with a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. The third-generation cases have a significant higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. Conclusions We concluded the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases andsuggested to take more comprehensive measures for screening patients, especially for elderly person, avoid family gatherings, and implement more closely surveillance of suspect patients and their close contacts.","Chen, Peng; Zhang, Ying; Wen, Yongsheng; Guo, Jinjun; Jia, Jinwei; Ma, Yu; Xu, Yi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jfma.2020.04.019,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2008,Clinical Guidance for the Management of Patients with Urothelial Cancers During the COVID-19 Pandemic – Rapid Review,"Abstract The current COVID-19 pandemic presents a substantial obstacle to cancer patient care. Data from China as well as risk models suppose that cancer patients, particularly those on active, immunosuppressive therapies are at higher risks of severe infection from the illness. In addition, staff illness and restructuring of services to deal with the crisis will inevitably place treatment capacities under significant strain. These guidelines aim to expand on those provided by NHS England regarding cancer care during the coronavirus pandemic by examining the known literature and provide guidance in managing patients with urothelial and rarer urinary tract cancers. In particular, they address the estimated risk and benefits of standard treatments and consider the alternatives in the current situation. As a result, it is recommended that this guidance will help form a framework for shared decision making with patients. Moreover, they do not advise a one-size-fits-all approach but recommend continual assessment of the situation with discussion within and between centres.","Patel, Karan; Choudhury, Ananya; Hoskin, Peter; Varughese, Mohini; James, Nicholas; Huddart, Robert; Birtle, Alison",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.005,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
2009,Personal View: Managing The Covid-19 Pandemic As A National Radiation Oncology Centre In Singapore,"Abstract COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. It has impacted the world medically, financially, politically and socially, with countries such as China and Italy adopting a full lockdown of their cities to mitigate the transmission. The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide. The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate. As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline. Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill. At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental. Here, we describe our experience as a large radiation oncology department in Singapore, including the challenges we encountered and how we managed our patient flow.","Tan, Boon Fei; Loong Tuan, Jeffrey Kit; Yap, Swee Peng; Ho, Shaun Zhirui; Chek Wang, Michael Lian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clon.2020.04.006,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2013,A close-up on COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases,"Abstract Aims To analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data Synthesis COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis. The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide. It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population. It targets human’s lung and causes serious damage of lungs. Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious. It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. In addition, some of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in China. As characteristic analysis of COVID-19 patients, hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity [1] and mortality of COVID-19 patients [2]. Therefore, to better understand the development of COVID-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of COVID-19 patients.","Li, Gang; Hu, Rui; Gu, Xuefang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
2014,Cardiovascular disease potentially contributes to the progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19,"Abstract Background A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused pneumonia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), outbroke in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and spread all over the world. Patients with COVID-19 showed huge differences in the hospital stays, progression and prognosis. As reported, the comorbidities may play an important role in COVID-19. Here, we aim to address the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods 83 confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into the CVD (n=42) and non-CVD (n=41) group according to their medical history. Medical records information including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT) as well as treatment measures were collected, analyzed and compared between two groups. Results COVID-19 patients with CVD showed: (1) more severe pathological changes in the lung, (2) elevated injury-related enzymes including α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HDBH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (3) significantly increased uncontrolled inflammation related markers, such as c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum amyloid A (SAA), (4) serious hypercoagulable status reflected by increased D-dimer and serum fibrinogen (FIB), and (5) higher mortality, compared to COVID-19 patients without CVD. Conclusions Our data indicated that CVD is a strong risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive medical care should be applied to patients with CVD to prevent rapid deterioration of the disease.","Li, Mingyue; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Haijun; Guo, Weina; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Tian, Chunxia; Du, Keye; Zhu, Rui; Wang, Li; Zhao, Lei; Fan, Heng; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.013,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
2015,"Adjuvant herbal therapy for targeting susceptibility genes to Kawasaki disease: An overview of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of Kawasaki disease","Abstract Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limiting acute systemic vasculitis occur mainly in infants and young children under 5 years old. Although the use of acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the standard therapy to KD, the etiology, genetic susceptibility genes and pathogenic factors of KD are still un-elucidated. Purpose Current obstacles in the treatment of KD include the lack of standard clinical and genetic markers for early diagnosis, possible severe side effect of AAS (Reye's syndrome), and the refractory KD cases with resistance to IVIG therapy, therefore, this review has focused on introducing the current advances in the identification of genetic susceptibility genes, environmental factors, diagnostic markers and adjuvant pharmacological intervention for KD. Results With an overall update in the development of KD from different aspects, our current bioinformatics data has suggested CASP3, CD40 and TLR4 as the possible pathogenic factors or diagnostic markers of KD. Besides, a list of herbal medicines which may work as the adjunct therapy for KD via targeting different proposed molecular targets of KD have also been summarized. Conclusion With the aid of modern pharmacological research and technology, it is anticipated that novel therapeutic remedies, especially active herbal chemicals targeting precise clinical markers of KD could be developed for accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","Tang, Bin; Lo, Hang Hong; Lei, Cheng; U, Ka In; Hsiao, Wen-Luan Wendy; Guo, Xiaoling; Bai, Jun; Wong, Vincent Kam-Wai; Law, Betty Yuen-Kwan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
2016,Vanadium: Risks and possible benefits in the light of a comprehensive overview of its pharmacotoxicological mechanisms and multi-applications with a summary of further research trends,"Abstract Background Vanadium (V) is an element with a wide range of effects on the mammalian organism. The ability of this metal to form organometallic compounds has contributed to the increase in the number of studies on the multidirectional biological activity of its various organic complexes in view of their application in medicine. Objective This review aims at summarizing the current state of knowledge of the pharmacological potential of V and the mechanisms underlying its anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-hypercholesterolemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective activity as well as the mechanisms of appetite regulation related to the possibility of using this element in the treatment of obesity. The toxicological potential of V and the mechanisms of its toxic action, which have not been sufficiently recognized yet, as well as key information about the essentiality of this metal, its physiological role, and metabolism with certain aspects on the timeline is collected as well. The report also aims to review the use of V in the implantology and industrial sectors emphasizing the human health hazard as well as collect data on the directions of further research on V and its interactions with Mg along with their character. Results and Conclusions Multidirectional studies on V have shown that further analyses are still required for this element to be used as a metallodrug in the fight against certain life-threatening diseases. Studies on interactions of V with Mg, which showed that both elements are able to modulate the response in an interactive manner are needed as well, as the results of such investigations may help not only in recognizing new markers of V toxicity and clarify the underlying interactive mechanism between them, thus improving the medical application of the metals against modern-age diseases, but also they may help in development of principles of effective protection of humans against environmental/occupational V exposure.","Scibior, Agnieszka; Pietrzyk, Lukasz; Plewa, Zbigniew; Skiba, Andrzej",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126508,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126508,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126508,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12
2017,NetNCSP: Nonoverlapping closed sequential pattern mining,"Abstract Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations.","Wu, Youxi; Zhu, Changrui; Li, Yan; Guo, Lei; Wu, Xindong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,Elsevier,10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
2018,DNA vaccines: prime time is now,"Recently newer synthetic DNA vaccines have been rapidly advanced to clinical study and have demonstrated an impressive degree of immune potency and tolerability. Improvements in DNA delivery over prior needle and syringe approaches include jet delivery, gene gun delivery, among others. Among the most effective of these new delivery methods, advanced electroporation (EP), combined with other advances, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in both preventative as well as therapeutic studies. Advancements in the design of the DNA inserts include leader sequence changes, RNA and codon optimizations, improved insert designs, increased concentrations of DNA, and skin delivery, appear to complement newer delivery strategies. These advances also provide a framework for the in vivo production of synthetic DNA biologics. In this review, we focus on recent studies of synthetic DNA vaccines in the clinic for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases with a focus on adaptive electroporation for delivery, and briefly summarize novel preclinical data advancing the in vivo delivery of DNA-encoded antibody-like biologics.","Gary, Ebony N; Weiner, David B",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

Several concepts in structure-based vaccine design have been put into practice and are are well along preclinical and clinical implementation. Testing of these designed immunogens will provide key insights into the ability to induce the desired immune responses, namely neutralizing antibodies. Many of these immunogens in human clinical trials represent only the first wave of designs and will likely require continued tweaking and elaboration to achieve the ultimate result of ever increasingly breadth and potency. Considerable effort is now being invested in germline targeting, epitope focusing, and improved immune presentation such as multivalent nanoparticle incorporation. This review highlights some of the recent advances in these areas as we prepare for the next generation of immunogens for subsequent rounds of iterative vaccine development.","Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.coi.2020.03.013,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Pathogens in turn encode numerous factors that inhibit nearly all steps of cGAS–STING signal transduction. From masking of cytosolic DNA ligands, to post-translational modification of cGAS and STING, and degradation of the nucleotide second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP, pathogens have evolved convergent mechanisms to evade cGAS–STING sensing. Here we examine pathogen inhibitors of innate immunity in the context of newly discovered regulatory features controlling cellular cGAS–STING activation. Comparative analysis of these strategies provides insight into mechanisms of action and suggests aspects of cGAS–STING regulation and immune evasion that remain to be discovered.","Eaglesham, James B; Kranzusch, Philip J",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002,31/10/2020,NA,NA,2020-10-31

2024,Strategies for daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract We performed a narrative review to explore the economics of daily operating room management decisions for ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is anticipated that there will be a substantive fraction of patients who will be contagious, but asymptomatic at the time of surgery. Use multimodal perioperative infection control practices (e.g., including patient decontamination) and monitor performance (e.g., S. aureus transmission from patient to the environment). The consequence of COVID-19 is that such processes are more important than ever to follow because infection affects not only patients but the surgery center staff and surgeons. Dedicate most operating rooms to procedures that are not airway aerosol producing and can be performed without general anesthesia. Increase throughput by performing nerve blocks before patients enter the operating rooms. Bypass the phase I post-anesthesia care unit whenever possible by appropriate choices of anesthetic approach and drugs. Plan long-duration workdays (e.g., 12-h). For cases where the surgical procedure does not cause aerosol production, but general anesthesia will be used, have initial (phase I) post-anesthesia recovery in the operating room where the surgery was done. Use anesthetic practices that achieve fast initial recovery of the brief ambulatory cases. When the surgical procedure causes aerosol production (e.g., bronchoscopy), conduct phase I recovery in the operating room and use multimodal environmental decontamination after each case. Use statistical methods to plan for the resulting long turnover times. Whenever possible, have the anesthesia and nursing teams stagger cases in more than one room so that they are doing one surgical case while the other room is being cleaned. In conclusion, this review shows that COVID-19 will markedly affect daily ambulatory workflow for patients undergoing general anesthesia, with potentially substantial economic impact for some surgical specialties.","Dexter, Franklin; Elhakim, Mohamed; Loftus, Randy W.; Seering, Melinda S.; Epstein, Richard H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109854,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109854,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jclinane.2020.109854,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2032,The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Spanevello, Antonio; Angeli, Fabio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

2038,"Diagnostic performance between CT and initial real-time RT-PCR for clinically suspected 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients outside Wuhan, China","Abstract Introduction Chest CT is thought to be sensitive but less specific in diagnosing the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre—Wuhan, China. Materials and methods Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). Conclusions Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.","He, Jian-Long; Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhen-Dong; Lyu, Jian-Xun; Ng, Ming-Yen; Shen, Xin-Ping; Wen, Zhibo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

2040,Practical strategies for a safe and effective delivery of aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19,"Abstract The COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe. It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze. Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus. This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy. Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.","Ari, Arzu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105987,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105987,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105987,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
2041,Association between chest CT features and clinical course of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Abstract Purpose This retrospective study aims to illustrate the radiographic characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the correlation with the clinical course. Methods 195 hospitalized patients confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 at First Hospital of Changsha, Hunan Province from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020 were enrolled. Chest computed tomography scan, clinical data and laboratory tests results were collected accordingly. Variable characteristics were recorded, radiographic evolution and outcome were analyzed along with the time course. Representative laboratory tests results were analyzed based on the image findings. Results Majority of the patients showed bilateral (73.8%), multiple lobes involvements (75.9%), peripheral distribution (83.1%), ground-glass opacification (41.0%), increased vascular margins (63.1%), long axis parallelism (55.9%), patchy ground-glass opacities beneath the pleura (51.3%) and consolidation (45.6%). According to the repeated radiology analysis, patients of improving/stable group tended to have younger age compared with worsening group (45.3 ± 15.0 VS. 59.3 ± 13.5, P = 0.001). Based on the laboratory test results, patients with positive image findings shared elder age, 46.0 (35.0–60.0)VS.31.0 (12.0–37.0) P < 0.001, and higher chance developing fever(P < 0.05); higher level of lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase; lower level of white blood cells, neutrophil and albumin(P < 0.001). Conclusions There are several specific image changes along with the disease progression may be helpful in early recognition and differential diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019. Comprehensive assessments of both imaging feature and laboratory test results may offer an intact knowledge of Coronavirus Disease 2019.","Luo, Zhibing; Wang, Na; Liu, Ping; Guo, Qian; Ran, Linyu; Wang, Feilong; Tang, Yuling; Li, Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105989,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105989,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105989,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are broadly reviewed in terms of transduction elements, biorecognition elements, electrochemical techniques, and biosensor performance. Transduction elements are discussed in terms of electrode material and form factor. Biorecognition elements for pathogen detection, including antibodies, aptamers, and imprinted polymers, are discussed in terms of availability, production, and immobilization approach. Emerging areas of electrochemical biosensor design are reviewed, including electrode modification and transducer integration. Measurement formats for pathogen detection are classified in terms of sample preparation and secondary binding steps. Applications of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of pathogens in food and water safety, medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and bio-threat applications are highlighted. Future directions and challenges of electrochemical biosensors for pathogen detection are discussed, including wearable and conformal biosensors, detection of plant pathogens, multiplexed detection, reusable biosensors for process monitoring applications, and low-cost, disposable biosensors.","Cesewski, Ellen; Johnson, Blake N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112214,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112214,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bios.2020.112214,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01
2045,Does public ownership of utilities matter for local government water policies?,"Abstract What differentiates local governments that implement water policies on equity and the environment? Analyzing a 2015 national survey of 1,897 U.S. municipalities, we find municipalities that own their water utilities are more likely to report policies to protect low-income residents from disconnection and implement water resource management. Respondents from 8% of municipalities report protecting residents from disconnection. State economic regulation of publicly owned utilities and Democrat-majority municipal governments are positively associated with local policies to protect low-income households from shutoffs but bear no association with resource management. Both local public ownership of utilities and state economic regulation may play a role in meeting certain local water policy goals.","Homsy, George C.; Warner, Mildred E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jup.2020.101057,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jup.2020.101057,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jup.2020.101057,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2050,Flash Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Pediatric Patients on anti-Cancer Treatment,"Abstract Introduction Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemics, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. Aim and methods We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. Results We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; del Pozo Carlavilla, María; Valerio Alonso, Maria Eli; Domínguez Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; Ten Bosch van der Werff, J.; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Juh Yeoh, Allen Eng; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Marisa; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

2052,Reorganization of Medical Oncology Departments during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Nationwide Italian Survey,"Abstract The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic is a global health problem, which started to affect China by the end of year 2019. In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.","Indini, Alice; Aschele, Carlo; Bruno, Daniele; Cavanna, Luigi; Clerico, Mario; Fiorentini, Giammaria; Fioretto, Luisa; Giordano, Monica; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ortega, Cinzia; Pinotti, Graziella; Scanni, Alberto; Zamagni, Claudio; Blasi, Livio; Grossi, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

2056,"The experience on COVID-19 and cancer from an oncology hub institution in Milan, Lombardy Region","Abstract The rapid outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 related disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19. Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organization’s progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our Institution. As of April 2nd, 2020, 110 574 COVID-19 cases and 13 157 deaths have been described in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19, of whom 16.5% were cancer patients. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple co-morbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no co-morbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard of care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range: 42–79 years), and patients carried a median of one co-morbid condition (0–2); two out of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 presentation, and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of cancer patients to treatments, prioritizing the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value, and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including in clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the Global Response Agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as ‘One Community’ working for ‘One Health’s.","Trapani, D.; Marra, A.; Curigliano, G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.04.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.04.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.04.017,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2058,SBDiEM: A new Mathematical model of Infectious Disease Dynamics,"Abstract A worldwide multi-scale interplay among a plethora of factors, ranging from micro-pathogens and individual or population interactions to macro-scale environmental, socio-economic and demographic conditions, entails the development of highly sophisticated mathematical models for robust representation of the contagious disease dynamics that would lead to the improvement of current outbreak control strategies and vaccination and prevention policies. Due to the complexity of the underlying interactions, both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models are built upon incomplete information regarding the infectious network. Hence, rigorous mathematical epidemiology models can be utilized to combat epidemic outbreaks. We introduce a new spatiotemporal approach (SBDiEM) for modeling, forecasting and nowcasting infectious dynamics, particularly in light of recent efforts to establish a global surveillance network for combating pandemics with the use of artificial intelligence.

We incorporated the governments’ interventions (stay-at-home advises/orders, lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing) against COVID-19 into consideration. Our analysis allowed us to make a statistical prediction on the turning point (the time that the daily new cases peak), the duration (the period that the outbreak lasts) and the attack rate (the percentage of the total population that will be infected over the course of the outbreak) for these countries.","Zhang, Xiaolei; Ma, Renjun; Wang, Lin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109829,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109829,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109829,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
2060,Surgical decision-making and prioritization for cancer patients at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: A multidisciplinary approach,"Abstract In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governmental agencies, state medical boards, and healthcare organizations have called for restricting “elective” operations to mitigate the risk of transmission of the virus amongst patients and healthcare providers and to preserve essential resources for potential regional surges of COVID patients. While the fear of delaying surgical care for many of our patients is deeply challenging for us as cancer care providers, we must balance our personal commitment to providing timely and appropriate oncologic care to our cancer patients with our societal responsibility to protect our patients (including those on whom we are operating), co-workers, trainees, families, and community, from undue risks of contracting and propagating COVID-19. Herein, we present guidelines for surgical decision-making and case prioritization developed among all adult disease specialties in the MD Anderson Cancer Center Departments of Surgical Oncology and Breast Surgical Oncology in Houston, Texas.","Tzeng, Ching-Wei D.; Tran Cao, Hop S.; Roland, Christina L.; Teshome, Mediget; Bednarski, Brian K.; Ikoma, Naruhiko; Graham, Paul H.; Keung, Emily Z.; Scally, Christopher P.; Katz, Matthew H.G.; Gershenwald, Jeffrey E.; Lee, Jeffrey E.; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2020.04.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2020.04.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.suronc.2020.04.029,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2062,Probable Pangolin Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Summary An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusively, this study suggests that pangolin species are a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs.","Zhang, Tao; Wu, Qunfu; Zhang, Zhigang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19

2064,Mitigation of emerging implications of climate change on food production systems,"Abstract Crops, livestock and seafood are major contributors to global economy. Agriculture and fisheries are especially dependent on climate. Thus, elevated temperatures and carbon dioxide levels can have large impacts on appropriate nutrient levels, soil moisture, water availability and various other critical performance conditions. Changes in drought and flood frequency and severity can pose severe challenges to farmers and threaten food safety. In addition, increasingly warmer water temperatures are likely to shift the habitat ranges of many fish and shellfish species, ultimately disrupting ecosystems. In general, climate change will probably have negative implications for farming, animal husbandry and fishing. The effects of climate change must be taken into account as a key aspect along with other evolving factors with a potential impact on agricultural production, such as changes in agricultural practices and technology; all of them with a serious impact on food availability and price. This review is intended to provide critical and timely information on climate change and its implications in the food production/consumption system, paying special attention to the available mitigation strategies.","Gomez-Zavaglia, A.; Mejuto, J.C.; Simal-Gandara, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109256,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109256,Elsevier,10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109256,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2069,Informal motorbike taxi drivers and mobility injustice on Hanoi's streets. Negotiating the curve of a new narrative,"Abstract The central government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Hanoi's municipal authorities are enthusiastically embracing a series of plans and policies for the capital city to create a sustainable mega-city. This state imaginary privileges ‘modern’ mobilities, championing highways, a bus rapid transport system, and an elevated metro, while so called ‘traditional’ means of moving around the city such as motorbikes, bicycles, or cyclos are being strongly discouraged and increasingly marginalised. For example, Hanoi officials are implementing a step-wise ban on motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030, while the majority of the urban population travels by motorbike, with about five million motorbikes plying the city's streets. While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe ôm). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi's xe ôm drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe ôm drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security. We thus see how marginalised individuals are counteracting policies they consider unjust, even when this urban agenda is embedded in a politically socialist context.","Turner, Sarah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102728,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102728,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102728,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2073,Using serology to anticipate measles post-honeymoon period outbreaks,"Abstract Measles vaccination is a public health ‘best buy’, with the highest cost of illness averted of any vaccine-preventable disease [1]. In the last decades, substantial reductions have been made in the number of measles cases, with an estimated 20 million deaths averted from 2000 to 2017 [2]. Yet, an important feature of epidemic dynamics is that large outbreaks can occur following years of apparently successful control [3]. Such ‘post-honeymoon period’ outbreaks are a result of the non-linear dynamics of epidemics [3]. Anticipating post-honeymoon outbreaks could lead to substantial gains in public health, helping to guide the timing, age-range and location of catch-up vaccination campaigns [4]. Theoretical conditions for such outbreaks are well-understood for measles, yet the information required to make these calculations policy-relevant is largely lacking. We propose that a major extension of serological studies to directly characterize measles susceptibility is a high priority.","Metcalf, C.J.E.; Wesolowski, A.; Winter, A.K.; Lessler, J.; Cauchemez, S.; Moss, W.J.; McLean, A.R.; Grenfell, B.T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tim.2020.04.009,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
2074,Severe cerebral involvement in adult-onset hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"Abstract The diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with cerebral involvement is challenging given the rarity of HLH and its resemblance to the much more common severe sepsis. Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare. HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction. Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19. Background Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015). Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).

2075,Guillain Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: A case report,"Abstract Novel outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019. Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.","Sedaghat, Zahra; Karimi, Narges",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

2077,Decades-old renin inhibitors are still struggling to find a niche in antihypertensive therapy. A fleeting look at the old and the promising new molecules,"Abstract Hypertension is a diverse illness interlinked with cerebral, cardiovascular (CVS) and renal abnormalities. Presently, the malady is being treated by focusing on Renin- angiotensin system (RAS), voltage-gated calcium channels, peripheral vasodilators, renal and sympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular and renal abnormalities are associated with the overactivation of RAS, which can be constrained by angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II (Ang-II) -AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. The latter is a new player in the old system. The renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang-I). This can be overcome by inhibiting renin, a preliminary step, eventually hinders the occurrence of the cascade of events in the RAS. Various peptidomimetics, the first-generation renin inhibitors developed six decades ago have limited drug-like properties as they suffered from poor intestinal absorption, high liver first-pass metabolism and low oral bioavailability. The development of chemically diverse molecules from peptides to nonpeptides expanded the horizon to achieving direct renin inhibition. Aliskiren, a blockbuster drug that emerged as a clinical candidate and got approved by the US FDA in 2007 was developed by molecular modeling studies. Aliskiren indicated superior to average efficacy and with minor adverse effects relative to other RAS inhibitors. However, its therapeutic use is limited by poor oral bioavailability of less than 2% that is similar to first-generation peptidic compounds. In this review, we present the development of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) from peptidic to nonpeptidics that lead to the birth of aliskiren, its place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and its limitations.","Ramya, Krishnappa; Suresh, Ramalingam; Kumar, Honnavalli Yogish; Kumar, B.R.

2083,Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations of COVID-19,"Abstract The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV,-2 has continued to progress, and increasing information is becoming available about the incidence of digestive symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected. These are postulated to be related to the virus’s use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","Agarwal, Amol; Chen, Alan; Ravindran, Nishal; To, Chau; Thuluvath, Paul J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

This document was prepared by the French speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM) in the emergency of the health crisis by a group of experts, based on the national and international recommendations available in the field of malnutrition, critical illness, metabolic stress and intensive care medicine on March 23, 2020. We hope that this article will bring to healthcare professionals, especially those not specialized in nutrition, useful landmarks to help them to manage hospitalized patients, infected or not by Covid-19 in the context of epidemic and intrahospital confinement.","Thibault, Ronan; Quilliot, Didier; Seguin, Philippe; Tamion, Fabienne; Schneider, Stéphane; Déchelotte, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.001,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
2089,Adaptations de la prise en charge des patients en Nutrition Artificielle à Domicile au cours de l’épidémie virale COVID-19 en France: avis du Comité de Nutrition à Domicile de la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme (SFNCM),"Résumé La nutrition artificielle à domicile, entérale ou parentérale, s’adresse à des malades chroniques fragiles. La situation actuelle de pandémie COVID-19 peut compromettre leur prise en charge à plusieurs niveaux : difficultés d’accès aux établissements de santé largement réorientés vers la prise en charge des malades COVID-19, possible pénurie d’infirmières à domicile, forte réduction des visites des prestataires de service à domicile, tensions sur les solutions hydro-alcooliques, les masques et les régulateurs de débit. Le but de ces recommandations établies par le Comité de Nutrition à Domicile de la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme est, d’une part, de préciser la prise en charge minimale de ces patients, tant en termes de suivi que de matériels, mais surtout de s’adapter aux tensions actuelles relatives aux personnes et aux matériels, afin de poursuivre une prise en charge de qualité et de ne pas compromettre l’état de santé des patients en nutrition artificielle à domicile pendant la crise. Abstract Home artificial nutrition, whether enteral or parenteral, is provided to chronic and fragile patients. The current COVID-19 epidemics may compromise their care at several levels: difficulties to access to hospitals mainly focused on treating COVID-19 patients, possible lack of nurses at home, strong reduction of visits by homecare providers, tended flow or lack of hand sanitizers, surgical masks and pumps. The aim of these recommendations put together by the French-speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM)’s Home Artificial Nutrition Committee is to define in terms of healthcare resources the minimum care to provide to these patients. We also aim to help cope with the possible tensions, in order to secure the care we must provide to home artificial nutrition patients during this crisis.","Schneider, Stéphane M.; Albert, Véronique; Barbier, Nathalie; Barnoud, Didier; Bouteloup, Corinne; Chambrier, Cécile; Fayemendy, Philippe; Flori, Nicolas; Goulet, Olivier; Guimber, Dominique; Jirka, Adam; Joly, Francisca; Lescut, Dominique; Neuville, Sébastien; Piquet, Marie-Astrid; Poullenot, Florian; Quilliot, Didier; Séguy, David; Stocco, Jeanick; Thibault, Ronan; Déchelotte, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

2091,Les nouveaux traitements de la stéatohépatite non-alcoolique,"Résumé La stéatohépatite non-alcoolique (NASH) est une maladie du foie responsable de complications et de mortalité de cause hépatique (fibrose, cirrhose, hépatocarcinome) et extra-hépatique (insulinorésistance, maladies cardiovasculaires). Actuellement, il n’existe pas de traitement approuvé dans cette indication. Toutefois, une perte de poids de 5 à 10% du poids initial permet d’améliorer l’histologie hépatique. Cet objectif est cependant soit difficile à atteindre chez tous les patients soit peu efficace ou pas indiqué en cas de diagnostic de la maladie à un stade de cirrhose irréversible. Différents médicaments à notre disposition dans le contexte dysmétabolique sont présentés (statines, metformine,…) avec leur impact sur la maladie hépatique. Récemment, de nombreux traitements à l’étude ont donné des résultats modestes mais encourageants. Plusieurs composés testés en phase 2 sont expliqués dans cet article dont les agonistes FXR et TGR5, agonistes PPARα/δ/γ, le FGF21 recombinant, l’analogue du FGF19, l’agoniste du récepteur thyroïdien β1, les agonistes GLP-1, les inhibiteurs de la lipogenèse, l’antagoniste CCR2/5… Les résultats les plus avancés concernent l’évaluation intermédiaire de l’étude de phase 3 de l’acide obéticholique (agoniste FXR) qui a notamment confirmé une régression de la fibrose hépatique avec ce traitement. Quatre autres composés sont actuellement également testés en phase 3. L’article fait également le point sur le bénéfice potentiel d’une combinaison de traitements. D’autres pistes thérapeutiques comme la chirurgie de l’obésité, la modulation du microbiote et l’endoscopie bariatrique sont exposés. Abstract Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease responsible for complications and mortality from hepatic (fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) and extrahepatic (insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases) causes. Currently, there is no approved treatment for this indication. However, a weight loss of 5 to 10% of the initial body weight is able to improve liver histology. However, it is difficult to achieve in all patients or ineffective / not indicated if the disease is diagnosed at an irreversible cirrhosis stage. Different drugs available in the dysmetabolic context are presented (statins, metformin, etc.) with their impact on liver disease. Recently, numerous agents have shown modest but positive results. Several compounds tested in phase 2 trials are explained in this article including FXR or TGR5 agonists, PPARα/δ/γ agonists, recombinant FGF21, FGF19 analog, thyroid receptor agonist β1, GLP-1 agonists, inhibitors of lipogenesis, CCR2/5 antagonist… The most advanced results concern the interim analysis of the phase 3 study on obeticholic acid (FXR agonist) which notably confirmed a regression of hepatic fibrosis with this treatment. Four other compounds are also currently tested in phase 3 trials. The multi-mechanistic strategy of a combination therapy is also discussed. Other therapeutic approaches such as obesity surgery, microbiota modulation and bariatric endoscopy are exposed.","Lanthier, Nicolas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nupar.2020.04.003,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
2092,Conduite à tenir devant un enfant fébrile au retour de voyage,"Résumé Les pathologies le plus fréquentes au retour de voyage à l’étranger sont les infections gastro-intestinales, les maladies fébriles et les problèmes dermatologiques. L’évaluation d’un enfant fébrile de retour de voyage est clinique : vérification des antécédents et des vaccinations, recherche d’autres cas au contact, signes fonctionnels et physiques, caractéristiques du voyage. Un bilan paraclinique de débrouillage complète souvent l’évaluation pour une orientation syndromique. Si les causes de fièvre sont surtout cosmopolites, la gravité des pathologies exotiques doit les faire rechercher en priorité. Le paludisme doit être évoqué devant toute fièvre en provenance d’Afrique subsaharienne. Le diagnostic repose sur l’association d’un frottis sanguin et d’un test sensible (goutte épaisse, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) ou d’un test de diagnostic rapide (pour Plasmodium [P]. falciparum). Les critères clinicobiologiques de gravité sont essentiels pour orienter et traiter le patient. En cas d’accès non compliqué à P. falciparum, le traitement repose sur une thérapie combinée à base d’artémisinine (ACT), artéméther-luméfantrine ou arténimol-pipéraquine. Les accès graves sont traités par l’artésunate intraveineux, puis un ACT oral. Dengue, chikungunya et infection à virus Zika ont des caractéristiques cliniques communes (association fièvre-éruption-arthralgies, traitement symptomatique). En cas de dengue, il faut surveiller l’apparition de signes d’alerte qui pourraient faire craindre une évolution péjorative. Le chikungunya est grave en cas de transmission per partum, avec un risque d’encéphalite néonatale. Chez l’enfant, le Zika est a- ou peu symptomatique. Mais en cas d’infection pendant une grossesse, le risque est celui d’une embryofœtopathie. Le diagnostic de ces arboviroses repose sur la PCR à la phase aiguë et la sérologie secondairement. La symptomatologie de la typhoïde est peu spécifique, justifiant la pratique d’hémocultures systématiques devant une fièvre du retour. Son traitement repose sur les céphalosporines de troisième génération ou la ciprofloxacine, mais les résistances augmentent. Au total, la diversité des étiologies d’une fièvre de retour et la gravité potentielle des infections importées imposent une réflexion sur le parcours de soins de ces patients, en particulier vis-à-vis du risque de fièvre hémorragique.","Minodier, P.; Imbert, P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpp.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpp.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpp.2020.04.002,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

2098,Approaches to the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Oral and maxillofacial surgery is correlated with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively. Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.","Zimmermann, Matthias; Nkenke, Emeka",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
2099,Portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet light disinfection in a teaching hospital animal laboratory in China,"Abstract An animal laboratory in a teaching hospital is a possible cause of cross infection. We aimed to assess the infection control in our animal laboratory and evaluate the disinfectant effects of a portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) machine. Samples were taken from the surface of research tables, other high touch places, such as doorknobs, weighing scales, and handles of trolleys, and from air in the barrier system pre- and post-manual cleaning and post-PX-UV disinfection. The bacteria types were identified. We found that routine manual cleaning significantly reduced bacterial colony form unit (CFU)/cm2 (P = .02), and the median of CFU/cm2 reduced from 0.5 pre-cleaning to zero post-cleaning. PX-UV disinfection also significantly reduced residual bacterial counts (P = .002), with the highest counts 10 pre-PX-UV disinfection and 1 afterwards. Without manual cleaning, PX-UV disinfected surfaces significantly (P < .001), median count 6 pre-PX-UV disinfection and zero afterwards. PX-UV significantly reduced bacterial colony counts in the air with the median count falling from 6 to zero (P < .001). Some of the 21 species of pathogens we identified in the current study are pathogenic, resistant to antibiotics, and able to cause nosocomial infections and zoonosis. PX-UV reduced counts of most of the pathogens. PX-UV is an effective agent against these pathogens.","Li, Jing-Jing; Wang, Shan-Ni; Qiao, Jiao-Jiao; Chen, Li-Hua; Li, Yu; Wu, Yong; Ding, Yan-Xia; Wang, Mei-Mei; Tian, Yun; Liu, Yun-Bo; Yan, Chen; Zhang, Chen; Gao, Chang-Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
2100,Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients’ in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients’ management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit. It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.","Alharbi, Ali; Alharbi, Saad; Alqaidi, Shahad",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
2101,Biological and Epidemiological Trends in the Prevalence and Mortality due to Outbreaks of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19,"Abstract The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2=0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Usmani, Adnan Mahmood; Meo, Anusha Sultan; Klonoff, David C.; Hoang, Thanh D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jksus.2020.04.004,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease. According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations. Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population. In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.

(2017). The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. Methods The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Results LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells. Conclusions LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.","Runfeng, Li; Yunlong, Hou; Jicheng, Huang; Weiqi, Pan; Qinhai, Ma; Yongxia, Shi; Chufang, Li; Jin, Zhao; Zhenhua, Jia; Haiming, Jiang; Kui, Zheng; Shuxiang, Huang; Jun, Dai; Xiaobo, Li; Xiaotao, Hou; Lin, Wang; Nanshan, Zhong; Zifeng, Yang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

2111,"NSAIDs in patients with viral infections, including Covid-19: victims or perpetrators?","Abstract Taking anti-inflammatory drugs, including non-steroidal (NSAIDs), during Covid-19 infection, how much is risky? The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections. Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.","Capuano, Annalisa; Scavone, Cristina; Racagni, Giorgio; Scaglione, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104849,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104849,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104849,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
2112,Candidate drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19,"Abstract Outbreak and pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020 will challenge global health for the future. Because a vaccine against the virus will not be available in the near future, we herein try to offer a pharmacological strategy to combat the virus. There exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit infection with and replication of SARS-CoV-2. Such drugs comprise inhibitors of TMPRSS2 serine protease and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Blockade of ACE2, the host cell receptor for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of TMPRSS2, which is required for S protein priming may prevent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Further, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and off-label antiviral drugs, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs arbidol and favipiravir as well as antiviral phytochemicals available to date may prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic.","McKee, Dwight L.; Sternberg, Ariane; Stange, Ulrike; Laufer, Stefan; Naujokat, Cord",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104859,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104859,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104859,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2114,Effects of public health policies on the health status and medical service utilization of Chinese internal migrants,"Abstract This paper examines the effects of the “Equalization Program of Basic Public Health and Family Planning Services for Migrants” (EHFPSM), a novel internal migrant-targeted public health policy, of China implemented in 2013. By combining the individual-level data from the “China Migrants Dynamic Survey” and city-level statistical data, we find that EHFPSM contributes to a 6.9% statistically significant increase in the probability of electronic health records coverage and a 7.2% increase in the probability of reimbursement in the last inpatient visit, as well as a 1.2% decrease in the probability of one-year prevalence. The mechanism test shows that this program promotes the migrants' understanding of the policies and social insurance coverage to enhance their health status. EHFPSM brings about more significant decreases in disease prevalence for male and less-educated migrants, and higher reimbursement probability for urban hukou migrants. Our paper facilitates better understanding of the role of public health policies in promoting the internal migrants' health from the perspective of China.","Fu, Minghui; Liu, Chuanjiang; Yang, Mian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101464,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101464,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101464,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2116,New paths for sustainable solutions to tackle global and emerging infectious threats,"Abstract With the dramatic background of a newly emerged virus (SARS-CoV-2) spreading around the world, Coronavirus and other infectious health threats for the human and animal populations were illustrated and debated in excellent presentations at the IABS meeting 26–28 of February 2020. Historical evidence of pandemics and lessons learned from recent epidemics or epizootics caused by many pathogens (e.g., Ebola, Zika, and African Swine Fever viruses) illustrated the overarching need for close international cooperation. New and old technologies in vaccine development and their use were presented, resulting in a call for greater interaction between the human and the veterinary fields in order to leverage the expertise and knowledge in both human and animal medicine. The One Health concept was also emphasized for eliminating the 59,000 fatal human rabies cases annually attributed to unvaccinated dogs. For preventable, infectious diseases commonly spreading in the poorer regions of the world, a new regulatory approach and governance structure was called for to give access to affordable vaccines. Vaccines were touted as one of the most successful health invention ever introduced; on a similar level to health improvements due to clean water.","Holm, Anja",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.04.003,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

2119,Recombinant expression of nanobodies and nanobody-derived immunoreagents,"Abstract Antibody fragments for which the sequence is available are suitable for straightforward engineering and expression in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. When produced as fusions with convenient tags, they become reagents which pair their selective binding capacity to an orthogonal function. Several kinds of immunoreagents composed by nanobodies and either large proteins or short sequences have been designed for providing inexpensive ready-to-use biological tools. The possibility to choose among alternative expression strategies is critical because the fusion moieties might require specific conditions for correct folding or post-translational modifications. In the case of nanobody production, the trend is towards simpler but reliable (bacterial) methods that can substitute for more cumbersome processes requiring the use of eukaryotic systems. The use of these will not disappear, but will be restricted to those cases in which the final immunoconstructs must have features that cannot be obtained in prokaryotic cells. At the same time, bacterial expression has evolved from the conventional procedure which considered exclusively the nanobody and nanobody-fusion accumulation in the periplasm. Several reports show the advantage of cytoplasmic expression, surface-display and secretion for at least some applications. Finally, there is an increasing interest to use as a model the short nanobody sequence for the development of in silico methodologies aimed at optimizing the yields, stability and affinity of recombinant antibodies.","de Marco, Ario",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2020.105645,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2020.105645,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pep.2020.105645,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

2128,Anesthesia Management and Perioperative Infection Control in Patients With the Novel Coronavirus,Anesthesiologists have a high risk of infection with COVID-19 during perioperative care and as first responders to airway emergencies. The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross-contamination to other patients and staff. The authors have presented a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into 1 of 3 risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources.

2142,Circulating Exosomes from Human Lung Transplant Recipients Having Respiratory Viral Infections Contain Nucleic Acids and Activate Signaling Pathways CGAS/STING and RIG-1,"Purpose Exosomes are membrane bound vesicles are released by cells into body fluids. Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K-α Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Methods Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem's library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Results Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFNβ) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.","Bansal, S.; Limaye, A.; Bharat, A.; Bremner, R.; Smith, M.; Omar, A.; Mohanakumar, T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,Elsevier,10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

2144,"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS DURING THE 2019 CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN WUHAN, CHINA: A DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY REPORT","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. 21.3% recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia and 87.2% of recipients had therapeutic tacrolimus concentration (5-12ng/ml). 5 and 6 recipients had liver and kidney insufficiency respectively. CONCLUSION HTx recipients that practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to COVID-19. These early data will require confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.","Ren, Zong-Li; Hu, Rui; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Zhang, Min; Ruan, Yong-Le; Wu, Zhi-Yong; Wu, Hong-Bing; Hu, Xiao-Ping; Hu, Zhi-Peng; Ren, Wei; Li, Luo-Cheng; Dai, Fei-Feng; Liu, Huan; Cai, Xin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.healun.2020.03.008,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

As of mid-March, Singapore remains in a containment mode with enhanced surveillance and limited community spread. Within this context, our service for pediatric eating disorder care has had to make significant adaptations to our models of service delivery as well as respond to the changing psychosocial needs of our patients. Given infection control requirements, we have instituted modular staffing for our inpatient and outpatient settings, necessitating task shifting and an increased use of technology for communication. Due to reduced outpatient capacity and the need to minimize non-urgent trips to the hospital, we have implemented telemedicine and have leveraged on partnerships with school counselors and other community partners. “Coronaphobia” has influenced our patients’ willingness to attend visits and worsened existing health anxiety for some. Responsiveness to families’ and patients’ health and financial concerns has been essential. As COVID-19 impacts more countries, our institution’s experience can provide insight into challenges and possible adaptations to providing ongoing care for eating disorder patients in this environment.","Davis, Courtney; Chong, Ng Kee; Oh, Jean Yin; Baeg, Amerie; Rajasegaran, Kumudhini; Elaine Chew, Chu Shan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

Initially, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death. Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications. Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function. Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.","Geng, Yong-Jian; Wei, Zhi-Yao; Qian, Hai-Yan; Huang, Ji; Lodato, Robert; Castriotta, Richard J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107228,Elsevier,10.1016/j.carpath.2020.107228,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","Ross, Samuel Wade; Lauer, Cynthia W.; Miles, William S.; Green, John M.; Christmas, A Britton; May, Addison K.; Matthews, Brent D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

In conjunction with our infection disease experts, we developed our guidelines based upon potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure and conservation of PPE. Results A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing. Conclusion Despite COVID-19 being a new threat, we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision tree algorithm for the interventional platform teams, we can ensure optimal healthcare worker safety.","Forrester, Joseph D.; Nassar, Aussama K.; Maggio, Paul M.; Hawn, Mary T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Prior to this, our children’s hospital proactively implemented an incident command structure which allowed for collaborative creation of safety measures, policies and procedures for both patients, families, staff and providers. Although the treatment and protective standards are continuously evolving, this commentary shares our thoughts on how an institution, specifically surgical services may develop collaborative process improvement to accommodate for rapid and ongoing change. Specific changes outlined include [1] early establishment of incident command [2] personal protective equipment conservation, [3] workforce safety, [4] surgical and ambulatory patient triage, and [5] optimization of trainee education. Please note that the contents of this manuscript are shared in the interest of providing collaborative information and are under continuous development as our regional situation changes. We recognize the limitations of this commentary and do not suggest that our approaches represent validated best practices.","Parikh, Sanjay R.; Avansino, Jeffrey R.; Dick, Andre AS.; Enriquez, Brianna K.; Geiduschek, Jeremy M.; Martin, Lynn D.; McDonald, Ruth A.; Yandow, Suzanne M.; Zerr, Danielle M.; Ojemann, Jeffrey G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.012,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11
2187,Novel Approach to Reduce Transmission of COVID-19 During Tracheostomy,"ABSTRACT Severe infection involving the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome that subsequently requires patients to be intubated and dependent on mechanical ventilation. In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients. With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff. As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions. In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient. Importantly, this technique is functional, easy to set up, and can be used for additional operations that involve risk of aerosolization or droplet exposure to operating room staff.","Foster, Peter; Cheung, Tiffany; Craft, Patrick; Baran, Kelsey; Kryskow, Mark; Knowles, Ross; Toia, Alyssa; Galvez, Christian; Bowling, Adam; DiSiena, Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.014,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

In the US, N95 respirator supply chains are severely strained and conservation strategies are needed. A multidisciplinary team at the Washington University School of Medicine, Barnes Jewish Hospital, and BJC Healthcare was formed to implement a program to disinfect N95 respirators. The process described extends the life of N95 respirators using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) disinfection and allows healthcare workers to retain their own N95 respirator across a large metropolitan health care system.","Grossman, Julie; Pierce, Andrew; Mody, Jessica; Gagne, Jason; Sykora, Carol; Sayood, Sena; Cook, Susan; Shomer, Nirah; Liang, Stephen Y.; Eckhouse, Shaina",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.029,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

It has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and caused more than 43,000 deaths globally. Here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges. Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic. Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses.

2192,Imaging Features of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Evaluation on Thin-Section CT,"Rationale and Objectives To retrospectively analyze the chest imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on thin-section CT. Materials and Methods Fifty-three patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection underwent thin-section CT examination. Two chest radiologists independently evaluated the imaging in terms of distribution, ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, air bronchogram, stripe, enlarged mediastinal lymph node, and pleural effusion. Results Fourty-seven cases (88.7%) had findings of COVID-19 infection, and the other six (11.3%) were normal. Among the 47 cases, 78.7% involved both lungs, and 93.6% had peripheral infiltrates distributed along the subpleural area. All cases showed GGO, 59.6% of which were round and 40.4% patchy. Other imaging features included “crazy-paving pattern” (89.4%), consolidation (63.8%), and air bronchogram (76.6%). Air bronchograms were observed within GGO (61.7%) and consolidation (70.3%). Neither enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes nor pleural effusion were present. Thirty-three patients (62.3%) were followed an average interval of 6.2 ± 2.9 days. The lesions increased in 75.8% and resorbed in 24.2% of patients. Conclusion COVID-19 showed the pulmonary lesions in patients infected with COVID-19 were predominantly distributed peripherally in the subpleural area.","Guan, Chun Shuang; Lv, Zhi Bin; Yan, Shuo; Du, Yan Ni; Chen, Hui; Wei, Lian Gui; Xie, Ru Ming; Chen, Bu Dong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

2217,Point of care and intensive care lung ultrasound: A reference guide for practitioners during COVID-19,"Abstract Objectives Current events with the recent COVID-19 outbreak are necessitating steep learning curves for the NHS workforce. Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required. The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. Key findings Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. Conclusion Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. Implications for practice The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.","Moore, S.; Gardiner, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.005,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

2219,"Management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, in the radiology department","Abstract Objectives From December 2019, a novel coronavirus named COVID-19 was reported in China. Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Key Findings The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. Conclusion In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. Implications for practice An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.","Zanardo, Moreno; Chiara Martini, MSc; Monti, Caterina Beatrice; Cattaneo, Federica; Ciaralli, Carmine; Cornacchione, Patrizia; Durante, Stefano",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.radi.2020.04.010,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

2223,American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Position Statement on Pharmacy Practice Management and Clinical Management for COVID-19 in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Patients in the United States,"Abstract The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a significant risk to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant or cellular therapy. The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) or cellular therapy pharmacy services utilizing telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient setting to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice but minimizing viral spread in a high risk, immunocompromised population. Additionally, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy patients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 increase, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT patients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDI) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already shown potential stress to usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged every member of the healthcare team and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations and remain committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients receiving HCT and cellular therapies.","Mahmoudjafari, Zahra; Alexander, Maurice; Roddy, Julianna; Shaw, Ryan; Shigle, Terri Lynn; Timlin, Colleen; Culos, Katie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbmt.2020.04.005,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

2225,Manipulation of autophagy by (+) RNA viruses,"Abstract Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process central to host metabolism. Among its major functions are conservation of energy during starvation, recycling organelles, and turnover of long-lived proteins. Besides, autophagy plays a critical role in removing intracellular pathogens and very likely represents a primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism. More recent findings indicate that it has not only retained its ability to degrade intracellular pathogens, but also functions to augment and fine tune antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, viruses have also co-evolved strategies to manipulate this pathway and use it to their advantage. Particularly intriguing is infection-dependent activation of autophagy with positive stranded (+)RNA virus infections, which benefit from the pathway without succumbing to lysosomal degradation. In this review we summarise recent data on viral manipulation of autophagy, with a particular emphasis on +RNA viruses and highlight key unanswered questions in the field that we believe merit further attention.","Wong, Ho Him; Sanyal, Sumana",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.07.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.07.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.07.013,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
2226,Direct trafficking pathways from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane,"Abstract In eukaryotic cells, protein sorting is a highly regulated mechanism important for many physiological events. After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and trafficking to the Golgi apparatus, proteins sort to many different cellular destinations including the endolysosomal system and the extracellular space. Secreted proteins need to be delivered directly to the cell surface. Sorting of secreted proteins from the Golgi apparatus has been a topic of interest for over thirty years, yet there is still no clear understanding of the machinery that forms the post-Golgi carriers. Most evidence points to these post-Golgi carriers being tubular pleomorphic structures that bud from the trans-face of the Golgi. In this review, we present the background studies and highlight the key components of this pathway, we then discuss the machinery implicated in the formation of these carriers, their translocation across the cytosol, and their fusion at the plasma membrane.","Stalder, Danièle; Gershlick, David C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.001,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
2227,Cellular evasion strategies of Helicobacter pylori in regulating its intracellular fate,"Abstract Helicobacter pylori colonizes human stomach mucosa and its infection causes gastrointestinal diseases with variable severity. Bacterial infection stimulates autophagy, which is a part of innate immunity used to eliminate intracellular pathogens. Several intracellular bacteria have evolved multipronged strategies to circumvent this conserved system and thereby enhance their chance of intracellular survival. Nonetheless, studies on H. pylori have produced inconsistent results, showing either elevated or reduced clearance efficiency of intracellular bacteria through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the mechanisms involved in autophagy induced by H. pylori and the fate of intracellular bacteria.","Sit, Wei Yang; Chen, Yu-An; Chen, Yu-Lun; Lai, Chih-Ho; Wang, Wen-Ching",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04

We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients, making up the entirety of such deliveries at our hospital. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by very focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular Complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.","Mulvey, J.

2244,Evaluation of the performance of DiaSorin molecular Pneumocystis jirovecii-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay from bronchoalveolar lavage samples,"Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR (PJ-CMV PCR) assay (DiaSorin Molecular LLC, USA) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples compared to direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii and assess CMV and P. jirovecii co-infection rate in immunosuppressed patients with suspected pneumonia. A total of 125 BAL samples from immunosuppressed patients submitted for PJP-IFA were tested. Surplus samples were saved and further tested by using the PJ-CMV PCR assay. Among the 125 samples, P. jirovecii was detected in 31.2% (39/125) and in 40% (50/125) of the specimens using IFA and PJ-CMV PCR respectively. Eleven of the PJ-CMV PCR positive samples were negative by direct IFA for P. jirovecii. All samples positive by direct IFA were also positive by PJ-CMV PCR. Using the direct IFA as a gold standard, the PJ-CMV PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of P. jirovecii were 100%, 87.2%, 78% and 100%, respectively. However, after reviewing the clinical diagnosis, the specificity and PPV increased to 100%. Of the 50 P. jirovecii samples positive by PJ-CMV PCR, 18 (36%) were also positive for CMV by the PJ-CMV PCR. The co-infection rate was found to be 37.5% (6/16) and 35.2% (12/34) in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. This study indicated that the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay has higher sensitivity than direct IFA for detection of P. jirovecii and provides rapid detection of PJ and CMV infection in BAL samples.","Kilic, A.; Elliott, S.; Hester, L.; Palavecino, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

2249,COVID19 pandemic impact on anxiety of French urologists in training: outcomes from a national survey,"Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak in France is disturbing our health system. Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. Material and Methods: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF).The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. Results: 275 (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR =1.76, IC95= [1.01-3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR=2.31, IC95= [1.20-4.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR =2.57, IC95= [1.31-5.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR=1.85, IC95= [0.98-3.59]) were additional risk factors. Conclusion: COVID19 pandemic has a negative impact on young French urologists in training and on their work and training quality. Managing their psychosocial well-being during this time is as important as managing their physical health.","Abdessater, Maher; Rouprêt, Morgan; Misrai, Vincent; Matillon, Xavier; Tellier, Bastien Gondran; Freton, Lucas; Vallée, Maxime; Dominique, Inès; Felber, Margaux; Khene, Zine-Eddine; Fortier, Edouard; Lannes, François; Michiels, Clément; Grevez, Tristan; Szabla, Nicolas; Boustany, Johnny; Bardet, Florian; Kaulanjan, Kevin; Seizilles de Mazancourt, Emilien; Ploussard, Guillaume; Pinar, Ugo; Pradere, Benjamin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2020.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2020.04.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.purol.2020.04.015,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2251,Rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the emergency department,"Abstract Background Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for infectious diseases, with a turn-around time <2 hours, are promising tools that could improve patient care, antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention in the emergency department (ED) setting. Numerous RDTs have been developed but not necessarily for the ED environment. Their successful implementation in the ED relies on their performance and impact on patient management. Objectives The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of currently available RDTs for infectious diseases in the ED. Sources PubMed was searched through August 2019 for available studies on RDTs for infectious diseases. Inclusion criteria included: commercial tests approved by the FDA or CE-IVD with data on clinical samples, ability to run on fully-automated systems and result delivery within 2 hours. Content A non-exhaustive list of representative commercially available FDA or CE approved assays was categorized by clinical syndrome: pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, meningitis and encephalitis, fever in the returning traveler and sexually-transmitted infection including HIV. The performance of tests was described based on clinical validation studies. Further, their impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based studies. Implications Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED workflow should be pre-planned considering local constraints of given settings. Additional clinical studies are needed to further evaluate their clinical and cost effectiveness.","Bouzid, Donia; Zanella, Marie-Céline; Kerneis, Solen; Visseaux, Benoît; May, Larissa; Schrenzel, Jacques; Cattoir, Vincent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29

2253,Lower respiratory tract infection in the community: associations between viral aetiology and illness course,"Abstract Objectives This study determined associations between respiratory viruses and subsequent illness course in primary care adult patients presenting with acute cough and/or suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Methods A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. Results The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration. Conclusions In healthy, working adults from the general community presenting at the general practitioner with acute cough and/or suspected LRTI respiratory viruses other than influenza impose an illness burden comparable to influenza.

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. Aims To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Sources The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. Content COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0–2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7–1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. Implications There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.","Petrosillo, N.; Viceconte, G.; Ergonul, O.; Ippolito, G.; Petersen, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28

2259,Rapid and visual detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) by a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"Abstract Objective To evaluate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and compare it with RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay. And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. Results The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) time was 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2×101 copies and 2×102 copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in the mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. Conclusion These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples.

However, the characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement and mortality are unclear. Methods All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Results A total of 663 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Among those, 247 (37.3%) had at least one kind of chronic disease. A total of 0.5% (n=3) of patients were diagnosed with mild COVID-19, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were in moderate, severe, and critical condition, respectively. In our hospital during follow-up, 251 of 663 (37.9%) patients were improved and 25 patients died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77%. Older patients (>60 years old) and those with chronic diseases were prone to have severe and critical COVID-19 conditions, show unimprovement, and die (P < 0.001, < 0.001).

Umifenovir (Arbidol®) is an antiviral drug being used to treat influenza in Russia and China. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir for COVID-19. Methods A retrospective study was performed in non-ICU Ward in Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to March 20, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into umifenovir group and control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes were the negative rate of pharyngeal swab’s test for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week after admission, as well as the duration for virus turning negative. The negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if the nucleid acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for 2 consecutive tests. Results A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in umifenovir group and 36 in control group. Baseline clinical, laboratory characteristics were comparable between two groups. 33/45 (73.3%) patients in umifenovir group were tested negative in SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36 (77.8%) in control group (p=0.19). The median time from onset of symtoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative were 18 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12-21) in umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR, 11-21) in control group (p= 0.42). Patients in umifenovir group had longer hospital stay than patients in control group (13 days [IQR, 9-17] vs 11 days [IQR, 9-14], p=0.04). No deaths or severe adverse reaction were found in both groups. Conclusions Umifenovir might not improve the prognosis or accelerate the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in non-ICU patients.

Methods The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. Results We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age. Conclusions Our results indicate early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","Shim, Eunha; Tariq, Amna; Choi, Wongyeong; Lee, Yiseul; Chowell, Gerardo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

2270,"Epidemiological, clinical characteristics of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal imaging findings","Abstract Purpose To investigate the epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings. Methods Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection of Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 8 underwent CT or x-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological, clinical data were analyzed between those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. Results Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients affected more than two lobes. The median radiograph score was 2.0 and there’s negative correlation between the score and oxygenation index (ρ=-0.657,P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with higher rate of coexisting condition(28.8%), lower rate of exposure history and longer time between onset and confirmation(5d) than non-pneumonia patients(all P < 0.05). Higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration, and headache, lower lymphocytes, albumin, serum sodium levels and higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels and lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels and higher serum creatinine and radiograph score at admission were predictive factors for severe/critical subtype. Conclusion Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiograph score can effectively predict severe/critical type.","Zhang, Xiaoli; Cai, Huan; Hu, Jianhua; Lian, Jiangshan; Gu, Jueqing; Zhang, Shanyan; Ye, Chanyuan; Lu, Yingfeng; Jin, Ciliang; Yu, Guodong; Jia, Hongyu; Zhang, Yimin; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Yida",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.040,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.040,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
2271,The enlightenment from two cases of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2: is it safe after 14 days of isolation?,"Abstract From 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found 2 asymptomatic infections. One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation.","Mao, Zhi-Qun; Wan, Ren; He, Li-Yi; Hu, Yue-Chun; Chen, Wei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.041,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.041,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
2272,Delivery of infection from asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in a familial cluster,"Abstract Objectives With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, it has become a worldwide health concern. One previous study reported a family cluster with asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers. Methods A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families. Results Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhoea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities. All the cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein. Conclusions Our findings indicate that COVID-19 can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period.","Ye, Feng; Xu, Shicai; Rong, Zhihua; Xu, Ronghua; Liu, Xiaowei; Deng, Pingfu; Liu, Hai; Xu, Xuejun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.042,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.042,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.042,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02
2273,Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients,"Abstract Background There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. Methods We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. Results Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between two group (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. Conclusions Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence IgG antibody production.","Zheng, Changcheng; Wang, Jinquan; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Ma, Yan; Zhu, Yuyou; Xia, Daqing; Wang, Yinzhong; He, Hongliang; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Yong; Fei, Mingming; Yin, Yihong; Zheng, Mao; Xu, Yehong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
2274,COVID-19: Four Paediatric Cases in Malaysia,"Abstract Objective This is a brief report of 4 paediatric cases of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia Background COVID-19, a coronavirus, first detected in Wuhan, China has now spread rapidly to over 60 countries and territories around the world, infecting more than 85000 individuals. As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease. Cases In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China. The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness. The cases were managed symptomatically. None required antiviral therapy. Discussion There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children. Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma. Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results. These issues have implications for infection control. Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children.","See, K.C.; Liew, S.M.; Ng, David C.E.; Chew, E.L.; Khoo, E.M.; Sam, C.H.; Sheena, D.; Zahilah Filzah, M.Z.; Chin, S.Y.; Lee, P.Y.; Tan, L.P.; Najwa, Z.

2275,Monitoring Transmissibility and Mortality of COVID-19 in Europe,"Abstract Objectives As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective was to report real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) case fatality rate (CFR). Methods Data were mainly obtained from WHO website, up to 9 March 2020. R(t) was estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time dependent (TD) methods. “R0” package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjust CFR (aCFR) were estimated. Results In EG method, R(t) was 3.27 [3.17-3.38] for Italy, 6.32 [5.72-6.99] for France, 6.07 [5.51-6.69] for Germany, 5.08 [4.51-5.74] for Spain. With TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 [2.21-4.11] for Italy, 6.56 [2.04-12.26] for France, 4.43 [1.83-7.92] for Germany, and 3.95 [0-10.19] for Spain.

Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiological assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Results The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-dimer, LDH and lactate levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.

2278,Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus — an updated intrim review and lessons from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,"Abstract Background The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).

It was recognized as a global health hazard. Methods 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. Results Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P <0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P <0.05). Conclusions Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dai, Hui; Zhang, Xin; Xia, Jianguo; Zhang, Tao; Shang, Yalei; Huang, Renjun; Liu, Rongrong; Wang, Dan; Li, Min; Wu, Jinping; Xu, Qiuzhen; Li, Yonggang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

To explore the impacts of the input population and quarantine strategies on the disease variations at different scenarios, four time points were assumed as Feb 6, Feb 16, Feb 24 and Mar 5 2020. The major results suggest that our model can well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. The simulated peak value of the confirmed cases is 1002 at Feb 10, 2020 which is mostly close to the reported number of 1007 at Feb 9, 2020. The disease will become extinction with peak value of 1397 at May 11, 2020. Moreover, the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Increasing the input population and decreasing the quarantine strategy together around the time point of the peak value of the confirmed cases, may lead to the second outbreak.","Hu, Zengyun; Cui, Qianqian; Han, Junmei; Wang, Xia; Sha, Wei E.I.; Teng, Zhidong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.010,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential. Methods We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Results Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308). Conclusion In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wang, Xiong; Tan, Li; Wang, Xu; Liu, Weiyong; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
2284,Changes in testing rates could mask the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) growth rate,"Abstract Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in China, it has rapidly propagated to around the world, leading to one of the most significant pandemic events of recent history. Deriving reliable estimates of the COVID-19 epidemic growth rate is quite important to guide the timing and intensity of intervention strategies. Indeed, many studies have quantified the epidemic growth rate using time-series of reported cases during the early phase of the outbreak to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0. Using daily time series of COVID-19 incidence, we illustrate how epidemic curves of reported cases may not always reflect the true epidemic growth rate due to changes in testing rates, which could be influenced by limited diagnostic testing capacity during the early epidemic phase.","Omori, Ryosuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.021,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
2285,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection of hospital isolation wards hygiene monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak in a Chinese hospital,"Abstract Objectives The aim of this paper was to monitor the presence of SARS-Cov-2 among hospital environment surfaces, sewage, and personal protective equipment (PPE) of staffs in isolation wards in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Methods Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant. Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Results During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. Conclusions Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards.","Wang, Jie; Feng, Haiting; Zhang, Sheng; Ni, Zuowei; Ni, Lingmei; Chen, Yu; Zhuo, Lixin; Zhong, Zifeng; Qu, Tingting",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.024,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
2286,Specific ACE2 Expression in Small Intestinal Enterocytes may Cause Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Injury after 2019-nCoV Infection,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.","Zhang, Hui; Li, Hong-Bao; Lyu, Jian-Rui; Lei, Xiao-Ming; Li, Wei; Wu, Gang; Lyu, Jun; Dai, Zhi-Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.027,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.027,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
2287,"Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infection in adult primary care patients: association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and illness course","Abstract Objectives To better target new vaccines and treatments being developed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (influenza), we studied the association of age with prevalence, diagnostic features and course of illness of these infections in primary care patients. Methods Secondary analysis of observational data on the aetiology, diagnosis and prognosis in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough in 12 European countries (2007-2010) using regression analyses corrected for clustering of patients within countries. Age groups were 18-59 years, 60-74 years, and 75 years and older (75+). Results Nasopharyngeal swabs for 144 (4.6%), 169 (5.4%) and 104 (3.4%) out of 3104 patients were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for RSV, influenza A and influenza B, respectively. RSV-prevalence in patients 75+ (8.5%) was twice the prevalence in those under 60 years (4.2%). Influenza prevalence was not associated with age. Diagnostic features for these viruses were not associated with age. Symptom duration was associated with age for RSV and influenza B, but not for influenza A. The odds of unresolved symptoms after 28 days was associated with age for RSV only. Illness deterioration was associated with age for RSV, with patients 75+ at increased risk, but not for influenza. Conclusion In adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, the diagnostic features of RSV or influenza infection are not associated with age. For RSV both the prevalence and illness course are significantly worse at higher age, for influenza only the illness course is.","Bruyndonckx, Robin; Coenen, Samuel; Butler, Chris; Verheij, Theo; Little, Paul; Hens, Niel; Beutels, Philippe; Ieven, Margareta; Goossens, Herman",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.020,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

2289,Epidemic update of COVID-19 in Hubei Province compared with other regions in China,"Abstract Aims & Background The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world. The aims of this study to help health workers better understand the epidemic of the COVID-19 and provide different control strategies toward Hubei Province and other regions in China. Methods A comprehensive search of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention official websites and announcements was performed between 20 Jan 2019 and 29 Feb 2020. The relevant data of the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results& findings Up to 29 Feb 2020, 79,824 confirmed cases with the COVID-19 including 66,907 in Hubei Province and 12,377 in other administrative regions were reported. The SARS-COV-2 showed faster epidemic trends compared with the 2003-SARS-CoV. A total of 2,870 deaths have been reported nationwide among 79,824 confirmed cases, with a mortality of 3.6%. The mortality of the COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei Province than that in other regions(4.1% versus 0.84%). Since 1 Feb 2020 the number of discharged cases exceeded the number of the dead. By 29 Feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which exceeded the number of hospitalized patients, and the trend has further increased. Conclusions The infection of the SARS-COV-2 is spreading and increasing nationwide, and Hubei Province is the main epidemic area, with higher mortality. The outbreak is now under initial control especially in other regions outside of Hubei Province. Due to the different epidemic characteristics between Hubei Province and other regions, we should focus on different prevention and control strategies.","Du, Wenjun; Han, Shaolei; Li, Qiang; Zhang, Zhongfa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.031,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.031,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
2290,Association of the COVID-19 pandemic with Internet Search Volumes: A Google TrendsTM Analysis,"Abstract Objectives To assess the association of public interest in coronavirus infections with the actual number of infected cases for selected countries across the globe. Methods We performed a Google TrendsTM search for “Coronavirus” and compared Relative Search Volumes (RSV) indices to the number of reported COVID-19 cases by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) using time-lag correlation analysis. Results Worldwide public interest in Coronavirus reached its first peak end of January when numbers of newly infected patients started to increase exponentially in China. The worldwide Google TrendsTM index reached its peak on the 12th of March 2020 at a time when numbers of infected patients started to increase in Europe and COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. At this time the general interest in China but also the Republic of Korea has already been significantly decreased as compared to end of January. Correlations between RSV indices and number of new COVID-19 cases were observed across all investigated countries with highest correlations observed with a time lag of -11.5 days, i.e. highest interest in coronavirus observed 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases. This pattern was very consistent across European countries but also holds true for the US. In Brazil and Australia, highest correlations were observed with a time lag of -7 days. In Egypt the highest correlation is given with a time lag of 0, potentially indicating that in this country, numbers of newly infected patients will increase exponentially within the course of April. Conclusions Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Public interest is on average highest 11.5 days before the peak of newly infected cases.","Effenberger, Maria; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il; Mayer, Gert; Tilg, Herbert; Perco, Paul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.033,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.033,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

Methods Experts from different countries experiencing Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) review evidence and country specific approaches and results of their interventions. Results Three key factors are important: 1. Reintroduction from countries with ongoing community transmission; 2. The need for extensive testing capacity and widespread community testing, and 3. Adequate supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, to protect health care workers. Lifting social distancing is discussed at length. How to open manufacturing, construction and logistics. The opening og higher educational institutions and schools. The use of electronic surveillance is discussed. Conclusion Each country has to decide what is the best path forward.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work. Methods The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan. All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none one of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died. Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section. All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery. Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed. Conclusions Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period. And COVID-19 is not an indication of cesarean section.","Cao, Dongmei; Yin, Heng; Chen, Jun; Tang, Fei; Peng, Min; Li, Ruobing; Xie, Hui; Wei, Xiaoying; Zhao, Yun; Sun, Guoqiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.047,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China was analyzed in this paper. Methods Various statistical and network analysis methods were employed. Results We found that COVID-19 patients show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; The estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; The epidemic in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients recently return from Wuhan; Network analysis revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected and various people's Hospitals are the main force in treating COVID-19. Conclusions The incubation period was statistical estimated and the proposed state transition diagram can well explore the epidemic stages of emerging infectious disease. We suggest that though the quarantine measures are gradually at work, strong measures might be still needed for a period of time, since ∼7.45% patients may have very long incubation periods. Migrant workers or college students are with high risk. State transition diagram can help us to recognize the time-phased nature of epidemic.

2295,Estimating instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China,"Abstract Objective The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate instant case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. Methods We collected 82735 confirmed cases released officially by Chinese authorities from Dec 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Afterward, instant fatality rate was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. Results In China, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from Jan 1 to Jan 17, and then gradually declined and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average case fatality rate in China was 6.1%±2.9%. While, the case fatality rate was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei. The cure rates of COVID-19 were 93.9%±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0%±0.4% in China except Hubei. Conclusion The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was much higher than that in China except Hubei. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was underestimated.","Mi, Yan-ni; Huang, Ting-ting; Zhang, Jun-xia; Qin, Qi; Gong, Ya-xin; Liu, Si-yu; Xue, Hui-min; Ning, Chang-hua; Cao, Lei; Cao, Yong-xiao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.055,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

The ACE system is not uniformly expressed in all the human races, and current differences could hypothesize some geographical discrepancies of infection around the world. However, animal studies showed that ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection. Because two third of the hypertensive patients take ACE-i/ARB, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current drugs.

2299,Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy,"Abstract Objectives This study aims to compare clinical course and outcomes between pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19 and assess the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Methods Medical records of pregnant and reproductive-aged non-pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 15 to March 15, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The severity of disease, virus clearance time, and length of hospital stay were measured as the primary interest and the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 was also assessed. Results Eighty-two patients (28 pregnant women, 54 reproductive-aged non-pregnant women) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Univariate regression indicated no association between pregnancy and the severity of disease (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.08-5.15; p =0.76), virus clearance time (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65-2.01; p =0.62), and length of hospital stay (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.66-1.84; p =0.71). There were 22 pregnant women delivered 23 live births either by cesarean section (17, 60.7%) or vaginal delivery (5, 17.9%) and no neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions Pregnant women have comparable clinical course and outcomes compared with reproductive-aged non-pregnant women when infected with SARS-CoV-2. No evidence supported vertical transmission of COVID-19 in the late stage of pregnancy including vaginal delivery.","Qiancheng, Xu; Jian, Shen; Lingling, Pan; Lei, Huang; Xiaogan, Jiang; Weihua, Lu; Gang, Yang; Shirong, Li; Zhen, Wang; GuoPing, Xiong; Lei, Zha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.065,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.065,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.065,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
2300,COVID-19 and Nigeria: Putting the realities in context,"Abstract Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was previously known as 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported in Wuhan,China in December, 2019. As at today the disease has evolved into a serious global emergency leading to its declaration as a pandemic recently. Body On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic having recorded her index case in February, 2020 with an increasing number of cases by the day and current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April, 2020. Although the recorded cases may albeit seem low, it has been forecasted that Africa will have a fair share of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into Intensive care units (ICUs) for Acute Respiratory Diseases (ARDs) and SARS COV-2 pnuemonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria especially as increased cases that may require critical care looms. The provision of quarantine or isolation facilities can also be a challenge in Africa and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease. Conclusion There is an urgent need to put in perspective the realities peculiar to Nigeria, and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the Coronavirus pandemic.","Ohia, Chinenyenwa; Bakarey, Adeleye S.; Ahmad, Tauseef",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.062,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.062,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.062,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

The current pandemic impacts on the duration of radiotherapy if patients under treatments and synchronously suffering from COVID-19. The models used to compensate the total dose in case of temporary treatment interruption are well known but it is of importance in that pandemic context to update and homogenize clinical practice in order to improve local control without increasing normal tissue complications.","Azria, David; Hennequin, Christophe; Giraud, Philippe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.001,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
2313,Organisation d’un service de radiothérapie pendant l’épidémie de COVID-19 : expérience du centre hospitalier de Mulhouse,"Résumé L’épidémie de COVID-19 continue de croître de manière exponentielle dans notre pays. Si la majorité des formes sont bénignes, les patients atteints de cancer sont à risque de voir se développer une forme grave de la maladie. Les services de radiothérapie sont un lieu à potentiel de contamination en raison du nombre de patients traités et de personnels présent. Leur organisation pendant la période épidémique vise à assurer la continuité des soins tout en limitant le risque de décès dû à une contamination par le SARS-CoV-2 (virus responsable de la COVID-19). Dans le service de radiothérapie du groupe hospitalier de la région de Mulhouse et Sud-Alsace, cette organisation s’articule en cinq points : la protection des personnels médicaux et paramédicaux, la protection des patients en cours de traitement, la détection des patients suspects d’être atteints de COVID-19 et leur prise en charge, la réorganisation du circuit patient et les mesures concernant l’organisation du système qualité du service. Nos pistes de réflexion, débutée dès le début de l’épidémie dans notre département, nous permettent de préserver au maximum l’accès aux soins radiothérapiques en anticipant le risque de diffusion du virus. Grâce à des réunions bihebdomadaires, nous continuons à nous adapter à l’évolution épidémique dans notre service, en tenant compte de nos moyens matériels. La possibilité de réaliser des tests de diagnostic chez tous les patients suspects nous permettrait également d’affiner nos procédures. Summary The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country. Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease. Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present. Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19. In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management. This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus. Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources. The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.","Ohnleiter, Thomas; Piot, Luc; Rogenmuser, Agathe; Noirclerc, Monique; Hamlaoui, Rabah; Grandgirard, Alain",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.canrad.2020.04.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

2315,Predicting the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) utilizing capability as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia pandemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiu, Ye; Zhao, Yuan-Bo; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Liao, Ce-Heng; Ge, Xing-Yi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19

2318,Comparative computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein epitopes in taxonomically related coronaviruses,"Abstract Several research lines are currently ongoing to address the multitude of facets of the pandemic COVID-19. In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenetic mechanisms; thus, helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures. The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins. Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins. These evidence provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.","Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Musella, Vincenzo; Britti, Domenico; Bonizzi, Luigi; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.002,14/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-14
2319,Chloroquine paradox may cause more damage than help fight COVID-19,"Abstract Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most recent health care crisis without specific prophylactic or therapeutic drugs. Antimalarial drug chloroquine (CHL) and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCHL) have been proposed to be repurposed to treat SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. CHL/HCHL have anti-inflammatory activity and are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and lupus. Although, CHL/HCHL have an anti-viral activity against several viruses in cell-cultures, the anti-viral activity in-vivo is questionable. Repurposing of CHL/HCHL to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is appealing. However, there is empirical evidence from animal studies with other viruses suggesting that CHL/HCHL may have an untoward paradoxical effect. One thus cannot exclude the possibility that CHL may increase the severity of the disease and prove deleterious both for the patients and public health efforts to contain the highly contagious and explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Sharma, Anuj",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.004,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
2320,The Potential Role of Th17 Immune Responses in Coronavirus Immunopathology and Vaccine-induced Immune Enhancement,"Abstract Increasing evidence points to host Th17 inflammatory responses as contributing to the severe lung pathology and mortality of lower respiratory tract infections from coronaviruses. This includes host inflammatory and cytokine responses to COVID-19 caused by the SARS-2 coronavirus (SARS CoV2). From studies conducted in laboratory animals, there are additional concerns about immune enhancement and the role of potential host immunopathology resulting from experimental human COVID-19 vaccines. Here we summarize evidence suggesting there may be partial overlap between the underlying immunopathologic processes linked to both coronavirus infection and vaccination, and a role for Th17 in immune enhancement and eosinophilic pulmonary immunopathology. Such findings help explain the link between viral-vectored coronavirus vaccines and immune enhancement and its reduction through alum adjuvants. Additional research may also clarify links between COVID-19 pulmonary immunopathology and heart disease.","Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Corry, David B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.005,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

2323,Influence of fireworks emission on aerosol aging process at lower troposphere and associated health risks in an urban region of eastern central India,"Abstract To study the influence of fireworks in atmospheric aerosols and their effect on health during the extreme firework days, fireworks tracer metals and carbonaceous species in size-distributed aerosols in the lower troposphere at Raipur in eastern central India were investigated during the 2018 Deepawali festival. Aerosol samples were collected, before Deepawali period (BDP, n = 5), during Deepawali period (DDP, n = 5) and after Deepawali period (ADP, n = 5). Bimodal size-distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. Bimodal distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K during DDP. The bimodal size distribution of K was found common for other events because of biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP indicated mixed sources from biomass burning and fireworks. During DDP, K and Ca were well correlated (r2 = 0.93) together. Strong metal-metal correlations were found between the following pairs, Zn–Fe, Cu–Fe and Cu–Ca, which indicated the similar firecrackers burning source. The atmospheric aging of aerosols was also found significantly high during fireworks days. Aging of aerosols were higher because of heterogeneous reactions of SO2 and NOx on aerosols directly emitted from fireworks. The observed high values of inhalation dose of elemental carbon during DDP period imposed higher risk of respiratory diseases. This study has provided carbonaceous fractions composition data as a tool to detect the aging processes of fireworks in ultra-fine, fine and coarse mode particles during the extreme firework days. Inhalation doses were calculated to establish potential influence on human health.","Mahilang, Mithlesh; Deb, Manas Kanti; Nirmalkar, Jayant; Pervez, Shamsh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apr.2020.04.009,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
2324,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Emergence, History, Basic and Clinical Aspects","Abstract In late December 2019, the world woke to a reality of a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), elicited by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to a group of β-coronavirus. The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In the last two decades, this is the 3rd deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date. Globally and as of April 1st 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities. While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China. SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats. Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures. This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.","Al-Qahtani, Ahmed A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.04.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.04.033,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.04.033,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
2325,Establishment of method for dual simultaneous detection of PEDV and TGEV by combination of magnetic micro-particles and nanoparticles,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are the main pathogens causing viral diarrhea in pig, mixed infections of these two viruses are very common in intensive pig rearing. However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect.","Luo, Le; Chen, Jing; Li, Xiaomin; Qiao, Dan; Wang, Zhenyu; Wu, Xingchen; Du, Qian; Tong, Dewen; Huang, Yong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
2326,"A sporadic COVID-19 pneumonia treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in Tokyo, Japan: A case report","Abstract Introduction An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has become a global threat. While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care. Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings. Case A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19. His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. Conclusions Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures. We need to be well prepared to secure healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases and nosocomial spread, as well as to provide necessary intensive care.","Nakamura, Kazuha; Hikone, Mayu; Shimizu, Hiroshi; Kuwahara, Yusuke; Tanabe, Maki; Kobayashi, Mioko; Ishida, Takuto; Sugiyama, Kazuhiro; Washino, Takuya; Sakamoto, Naoya; Hamabe, Yuichi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiac.2020.03.018,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

Systemic corticosteroid has been sometimes administered to severe infectious diseases combined with the specific treatment. However, as lack of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, systemic steroid treatment has not been recommended for COVID-19. We report here three cases of the COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with ciclesonide inhalation. Rationale of the treatment is to mitigate the local inflammation with inhaled steroid that stays in the lung and to inhibit proliferation of the virus by antiviral activity.

2333,Therapeutic or detrimental mobilities? Walking groups for older adults,"Abstract The health benefits of walking through greenspace have earned widespread academic attention in recent years and have been termed ‘therapeutic mobilities’. As a result, walking groups are actively encouraged by health professionals as a way to promote ‘healthy ageing’. This paper examines whether the promotion of community-led walking groups relies upon overly optimistic understandings that portray walking in greenspace as an inherently therapeutic practice. Accordingly, this paper introduces the concept of ‘detrimental mobilities’ to explore how the shared movement promoted via walking groups may not always be inherently therapeutic and may have some detrimental impacts on the individuals who take part in these activities. Drawing on findings from in-depth walking interviews with older members of the ‘Walking for Health’ scheme in Southampton, England, this paper examines how mobilities have the potential to disable, as much as they enable, health and wellbeing.","Paddon, Laura Isobel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102346,Elsevier,10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102346,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2335,Viroporins and inflammasomes: A key to understand virus-induced inflammation,"Abstract Viroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1β was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1β is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1β, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K+, H+ and Ca2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Particularly, CXCL17 is produced along the epithelium of the airways both at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17 emphasizing its clinical potential in respiratory disorders.","Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Thirunavukkarasu, Shyamala; Zúñiga, Joaquín; Khader, Shabaana A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.004,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
2337,Cytokine storm intervention in the early stages of COVID-19 pneumonia,"Abstract Clinical intervention in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated a strong upregulation of cytokine production in patients who are critically ill with SARS-CoV2-induced pneumonia. In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30th, 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality. The cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 illness is also an important component of mortality in other viral diseases, including SARS, MERS and influenza. In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.","Sun, Xinjuan; Wang, Tianyuan; Cai, Dayong; Hu, Zhiwei; Chen, Jin’an; Liao, Hui; Zhi, Liming; Wei, Hongxia; Zhang, Zhihong; Qiu, Yuying; Wang, Jing; Wang, Aiping",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.04.002,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25

In addition, dendrimers are well-defined nano-sized symmetric polymeric molecules. In this review, we provide an analysis of the use of dendrimers modified with aptamers as nonviral vectors to specifically target tumor cells. Various anticancer agents have been encapsulated with dendrimers complexing with aptamers, including epirubicin, camptothecin, Bcl-xL short hairpin (sh)RNA, and 5-fluorouracil rhodamine-labeled dextran.

2340,Viral replicons as valuable tools for drug discovery,"RNA viruses can cause severe diseases such as dengue, Lassa, chikungunya and Ebola. Many of these viruses can only be propagated under high containment levels, necessitating the development of low containment surrogate systems such as subgenomic replicons and minigenome systems. Replicons are self-amplifying recombinant RNA molecules expressing proteins sufficient for their own replication but which do not produce infectious virions. Replicons can persist in cells and are passed on during cell division, enabling quick, efficient and high-throughput testing of drug candidates that act on viral transcription, translation and replication. This review will explore the history and potential for drug discovery of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and norovirus replicon and minigenome systems.","Hannemann, Holger",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

There is a strong sense of déjà vu because there are still no effective treatments. In the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a new virus, there are already drugs suggested as active in in vitro assays that are being repurposed in clinical trials.

2343,Pharmaceutical patents: reconciling the human right to health with the incentive to invent,"In developed countries that protect core aspects of the fundamental human right to the highest attainable standard of health, how does that right intersect with intellectual property rights? Here, the human rights implication of providing access to all cancer drugs recommended by experts in a developed country is considered in the context of conflict between the incentive to invent and the rights of others to access medicines. Effective incentives to innovate in developed countries can lead to global improvements in access to medicine if the intellectual property system is calibrated to permit this. This depends partly on the usefulness of compulsory licensing and alternative mechanisms facilitating global access to drugs. This review considers tensions between fundamental rights to access essential medicines and rights of the inventor and investors, including the pharmaceutical industry.","Khachigian, Levon M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.drudis.2020.04.009,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

2345,Potential applications of plant biotechnology against SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for an ongoing human pandemic (COVID-19). There is a massive international effort underway to develop diagnostic reagents, vaccines and antiviral drugs in a bid to slow down the spread of the disease and save lives. One part of that international effort involves the research community working with plants, bringing researchers from all over the world together with commercial enterprises in order to achieve the rapid supply of protein antigens and antibodies for diagnostic kits, and scalable production systems for the emergency manufacturing of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Here we look at some of the ways in which plants can and are being used in the fight against COVID-19.","Capell, Teresa; Twyman, Richard M.; Armario-Najera, Victoria; Ma, Julian K.-C.; Schillberg, Stefan; Christou, Paul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tplants.2020.04.009,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
2346,Bioenergy in China: Evaluation of domestic biomass resources and the associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials,"Abstract As bioenergy produces neutral or even negative carbon emissions, the assessment of biomass resources and associated emissions mitigation is a key step toward a low carbon future. However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (−26.6%, 39.7%) and (−27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020–2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73–5859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78–1344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China's untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change.","Kang, Yating; Yang, Qing; Bartocci, Pietro; Wei, Hongjian; Liu, Sylvia Shuhan; Wu, Zhujuan; Zhou, Hewen; Yang, Haiping; Fantozzi, Francesco; Chen, Hanping",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

2349,Innovative “Bring-Service-Near-Your-Home” Operations under Corona-Virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak: Can Logistics Become the Messiah?,"Abstract The corona virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has created serious disruptions to many business operations. Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the “static service operations” to become the “bring-service-near-your-home” mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers. Finally, we study the optimal safety technology investment problem.","Choi, Tsan-Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101961,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101961,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101961,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2351,The COVID-19 pandemic: Important considerations for contact lens practitioners,"Abstract A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).","Jones, Lyndon; Walsh, Karen; Willcox, Mark; Morgan, Philip; Nichols, Jason",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

Methods A social-media survey was carried out, asking 257 optometrists and opticians in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (i) which PPE they intended to use in the future (after lockdown and before herd immunity and / or vaccine availability) and (ii) what they would ask the patient to do in terms of this. Results 75% of the ECPs planned on wearing masks during refractions and 69% when fitting contact lens. 62% of the ECPs also expected their patients to wear masks in these tasks. This number is higher than for distance tasks such as fitting frames. Around 90% of the ECPs would, in addition to hand washing, disinfect their hands and around 80% expected their patients to do so too. Less than one third of ECPs favoured wearing safety spectacles, gloves and / or protective facial shields. 73% planed on disinfecting frames after they would have been tried on by customers. Conclusions In summary, most ECPs planed on continuing to use higher standards of PPE. Those, who intended to wear masks themselves, would ask their patients to also do so, combined with hand disinfection.","Pult, Heiko",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clae.2020.04.006,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

2362,Head and neck oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Reconsidering traditional treatment paradigms in light of new surgical and other multilevel risks,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms. Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: 1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; 2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; 3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; 4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; 5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.

2375,What Dentists Need to Know about COVID-19,"Abstract This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by now. In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China. There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human. The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients’ saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19. There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive. Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life. As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.","Fini, Maryam Baghizadeh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104741,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104741,Elsevier,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104741,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2378,Distinctive Cellular Response to Aluminum Based Adjuvants,"Abstract Aluminum-based adjuvants (ABAs) are used in human vaccines to enhance the magnitude of protective immune responses elicited against specific pathogens. One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvant’s effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 µg/mL) of the adjuvants for 24 h or 72 h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72 h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.","Nies, Isaac; Hidalgo, Krisha; Bondy, Stephen C.; Campbell, Arezoo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404,Elsevier,10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
2379,Electrostatic Charged Nanofiber Filter for Filtering Airborne Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Nano-aerosols,"Abstract The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300nm. The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50-500nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases.","Woon Fong Leung, Wallace; Sun, Qiangqiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116886,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116886,Elsevier,10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116886,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22

As a result of the pandemic, medical healthcare providers are under an enormous amount of workload pressure along with increased total health expenditures. The overwhelming burden of COVID-19 illness could lead to caregiver burnout. Direct-to-consumer telemedicine can enable patients to connect with their healthcare provider at a distance. This virtual platform could be used by smartphones or webcam-enabled computers and allows physicians to effectively screen patients with early signs of COVID-19 before they reach to hospital.","Moazzami, Bobak; Razavi-Khorasani, Niloofar; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Farokhi, Ermia; Rezaei, Nima",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104345,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104345,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104345,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
2381,"Dynamic profile of RT-PCR findings from 301 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","Abstract Background With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its effect on society is amplified. We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. Results Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30% of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. Conclusions This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years.","Xiao, Ai Tang; Tong, Yi Xin; Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Yu Jie; Zhang, Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104346,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104346,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104346,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

2384,Epidemiological and initial clinical characteristics of patients with family aggregation of COVID-19,"Abstract Background Since December 2019, a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and rapidly spread throughout China, however, confirmed cases are still increasing worldwide. Objectives To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. Study design Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). Results Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2–14 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients Conclusions Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.","Xia, Xiao-ying; Wu, Jing; Liu, He-lei; Xia, Hong; Jia, Bei; Huang, Wen-xiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
2385,The clinical course and its correlated immune status in COVID-19 pneumonia,"Abstract Objectives To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID-19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results All Patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135). Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3 + T cell, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, B cell (CD19+) and NK cell (CD16 + 56+), were significantly lower in severe group (P＜0.001). The dynamic levels of T lymphocytes in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level. The cut-off value of the counts of CD3+ (576), CD4+ (391) and CD8+ (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19. Conclusion Our results shown that the decrease of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8 + T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases. The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The application of glucocorticoid should be cautious in severe cases.","He, Ruyuan; Lu, Zilong; Zhang, Lin; Fan, Tao; Xiong, Rui; Shen, Xiaokang; Feng, Haojie; Meng, Heng; Lin, Weichen; Jiang, Wenyang; Geng, Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104361,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104361,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104361,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12

Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. Objectives We aimed to provide a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2. Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. Results We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020- 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-COV-2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2.

2388,Multi-Stage Group Testing Improves Efficiency of Large-Scale COVID-19 Screening,"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 test kits are in critical shortage in many countries. This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. Objective Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. Study design We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. Results We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. Conclusion These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eberhardt, J.N.; Breuckmann, N.P.; Eberhardt, C.S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104382,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104382,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104382,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2390,"Gastrointestinal, Hepatobiliary, and Pancreatic Manifestations of COVID-19","Abstract There is an increasing number of confirmed cases and deaths caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contributing to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. At this point, the need for further disease characterization is critical. COVID-19 is well established as a respiratory tract pathogen; however, recent studies have shown an increasing number of patients reporting gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital presentation is often delayed compared to that of respiratory symptoms. It has been noted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic. In this article, SARS-CoV-2 and its disease COVID-19 will be reviewed with consideration of the latest literature about gastrointestinal symptomatology, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and the possibility of viral replication contributing to a fecal-oral route of transmission.","Patel, Kishan P.; Patel, Puja A.; Vunnam, Rama R.; Hewlett, Alexander T.; Jain, Rohit; Jing, Ran; Vunnam, Srinivas R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104386,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104386,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104386,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
2391,Detection of low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs using three commercial molecular assays,"Abstract In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been rapidly developed and broadly deployed in laboratories worldwide. Although these assays have been reported to correlate well, we sought to compare the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 to the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 or the Lightmix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene assay for nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs with low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thirty-seven NP swabs were studied, including 10 samples with a moderate cycle threshold (Ct) between 30-33.9, and 22 with Ct≥34, and 5 negative for SARS-CoV-2. Overall concordance on initial comparison was 86.5% (32/37), which was 100% concordance for samples with Ct values ranging between 30-33.9. Discordance amongst samples showing a Ct ≥34 was 22.7% (5/22). Endpoint value analysis on the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 within the discordant samples noted two with an endpoint value >5, which were detected by the cobas® or Lightmix®. Testing of SARS-CoV-2 on the three commercial assays was comparable for NP swabs with moderate Ct values, while high Ct values were less concordant. Importantly, analysis of Xpert® endpoint values improved interpretation of discrepant results.","Lowe, Christopher F.; Matic, Nancy; Ritchie, Gordon; Lawson, Tanya; Stefanovic, Aleksandra; Champagne, Sylvie; Leung, Victor; Romney, Marc G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104387,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104387,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104387,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2393,Clinical evaluation of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay on a fully automated system for rapid on-demand testing in the hospital setting,"Abstract Background The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a unique challenge for diagnostic laboratories around the world. Automation of workflows in molecular diagnostics is instrumental for coping with the large number of tests ordered by clinicians, as well as providing fast-tracked rapid testing for highly urgent cases. In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. Methods A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. Results The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/ml and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100% and 99.2% respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3%. Conclusion The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay. Due to its random-access workflow concept and rapid time-to-result of about 80 minutes, the system is very well suited for providing fast-tracked SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for urgent clinical samples in the hospital setting.","Nörz, Dominik; Fischer, Nicole; Schultze, Alexander; Kluge, Stefan; Mayer-Runge, Ulrich; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104390,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104390,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104390,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
2394,"Predictive factors for disease progression in hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China","Abstract Background A few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear. Objective Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Study design This is a single-center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. Results Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00–5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C‐reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/ml [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

2396,The Diagnosis of Pandemic Coronavirus Pneumonia: A Review of Radiology Examination and Laboratory Test,"Abstract Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemic prevention strategies have been implemented worldwide. For the sake of controlling the infectious coronavirus pneumonia, early diagnosis and quarantine play an imperative role. Currently, the mainstream diagnostic methods are imaging and laboratory diagnosis, which differ in their efficacy of diagnosis. To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis. The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697). Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.","Zheng, Zhong; Yao, Zhixian; Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104396,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104396,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104396,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2402,COVID-19: a meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy of commercial assays registered in Brazil,"Abstract The accuracy of commercially available tests for COVID-19 in Brazil remains unclear. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil. Future studies addressing the diagnostic performance of tests for COVID-19 in the Brazilian population are urgently needed.","Castro, Rodolfo; Luz, Paula M; Wakimoto, Mayumi D; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Perazzo, Hugo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bjid.2020.04.003,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have demonstrated a strong safety profile and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but whether these therapies are effective for treating respiratory virus-induced ARDS is unknown. According to the WHO ICTRP and the NIH clinicaltrials.gov databases, 27 clinical investigations of MSC-based cell therapy approaches have begun in China since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as a growing number of academic and industry trials elsewhere. Several recent published reports have suggested potential efficacy; however, the available data presented is either anecdotal or from incomplete, poorly controlled investigations. Therefore, while there may be a potential role for MSCs and other cell-based therapies in treatment of COVID-19, these need to be investigated in a rationally designed, controlled approach if safety and efficacy are to be demonstrated accurately. We urge that the field proceeds by finding balance between swift experimentation and communication of results, and scientifically coherent generation and analysis of clinical data.","Khoury, Maroun; Rocco, Patricia R.M.; Phinney, Donald G; Krampera, Mauro; Martin, Ivan; Viswanathan, Sowmya; Nolta, Jan A.; LeBlanc, Katarina; Galipeau, Jacques; Weiss, Daniel J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.089,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcyt.2020.04.089,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
2410,"Invasive alien plant species: Their impact on environment, ecosystem services and human health","Abstract Ecological perturbations caused by biotic invasion have been identified as a growing threat to global sustainability. Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.","Kumar Rai, Prabhat; Singh, J.S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Such pre-vaccine assessment might allow not only population-based, but also more personalized vaccination strategies (‘precision vaccination’). If baseline immune signatures are predictive, the underlying mechanism they reflect may also determine vaccination outcome. Thus, baseline signatures might contribute to identifying interventional targets to be modulated prior to vaccination in order to improve vaccination responses. This concept has the potential to transform vaccination strategies and usher in a new approach to improve global health.","Tsang, John S.; Dobaño, Carlota; VanDamme, Pierre; Moncunill, Gemma; Marchant, Arnaud; Othman, Rym Ben; Sadarangani, Manish; Koff, Wayne C.; Kollmann, Tobias R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

AID thus potentiates the humoral response to clear pathogens. Marking the 20th anniversary of the discovery of AID, we synthesize the current understanding of AID function. We discuss AID biochemistry and how error-free forms of DNA repair are co-opted to prioritize mutagenesis over accuracy during antibody diversification. We discuss the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathway during class switch recombination. We describe genomic targeting of AID as a multilayered process involving chromatin architecture, cis and trans-acting factors, and determining mutagenesis -- distinct from AID occupancy at loci that are spared from mutation.","Feng, Yuqing; Seija, Noé; Di Noia, Javier; Martin, Alberto",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.it.2020.04.009,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.","Sun, Jiumeng; He, Wan-Ting; Wang, Lifang; Lai, Alexander; Ji, Xiang; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Li, Gairu; Suchard, Marc A.; Tian, Jin; Zhou, Jiyong; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,21/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-21

2429,After corona: there is life after the pandemic,"Abstract The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has focused the attention of medical-care providers away from non-life-threatening diseases, including infertility. Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life. Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are age-dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do not transmit COVID-19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.","Tesarik, Jan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

Time to egg collection and drop-out rates are parameters critical to scheduling treatments once the curve of infections has peaked and plateaued in each country. In order to reduce both parameters, infertile patients now require even more support from their IVF team: urgent oocyte collection for oncologic patients must be guaranteed, and oocyte retrievals for women of advanced maternal age and/or reduced ovarian reserve cannot be postponed indefinitely.

Methylene blue-plasma (MBP) has been used for over 20 years, but its efficacy in this setting remains controversial. Patients and methods: this is a comparative analysis of the experience of two Centres, with different plasma products, to evaluate their efficacy in TTP. One centre used quarantine plasma (QP), and MBP the other. We performed a retrospective longitudinal study, analysing the clinical files of TTP patients of a 13-year data evaluation period. Duration of treatment and transfusion parameters, medical record, laboratory testing, concomitant medication, and survival rate, were assessed for every episode. Results During the study period, 12 (55.5 %) and 10 (45.5 %) new cases were treated with QP and MBP, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of TPE processes, days elapsed from diagnosis to TPE, and plasma volume transfused. The QP TPE episodes of treatment were significantly associated with an increased time to recovery compared with MBP episodes of treatment (p = 0.004). Conclusion MBP was as effective as QP in the treatment of TTP patients. Since recovery was more favourable when MBP was used, we consider MBP remains a suitable alternative to treat TTP patients.","Rodríguez, José L.

2436,Disease X: accelerating the development of medical countermeasures for the next pandemic,"Summary WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no, or insufficient, medical countermeasures. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures. We intend to cover these topics in future publications.","Simpson, Shmona; Kaufmann, Michael C; Glozman, Vitaly; Chakrabarti, Ajoy",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,Elsevier,10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17

2438,"Safety and immunogenicity of a candidate Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus viral-vectored vaccine: a dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial","Summary Background Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection continue to rise in the Arabian Peninsula 7 years after it was first described in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans. Methods This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 109 viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 1010 viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 1010 viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578. Findings Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 × 1010 viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66–81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18–33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11–17·42], p<0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p<0·003) and IgG (p<0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19–73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58–93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. Interpretation ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

2439,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Summary Background Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. Methods We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R 0] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R 0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. Findings For the baseline scenario, when R 0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000–320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000–776 000) when R 0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000–1 249 000) when R 0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R 0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R 0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 −94·4) when R 0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R 0 of 1·5. Interpretation Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

2440,"Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","Summary Background In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29–34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. Interpretation The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

2446,Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study,"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. Findings Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95% CI −0·19 to −0·11; R 2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R 2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. Interpretation Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

2447,"Clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhejiang, China: an observational cohort study","Summary Background Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Findings From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

2448,Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series,"Summary Background On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Methods In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. Findings The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. Interpretation We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

2452,"Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China","Summary Background The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Findings The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22–64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5–4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22–67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18–68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0–42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

2453,"Evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei province, China: a descriptive and modelling study","Summary Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R t) at the provincial level. Findings We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33–56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0–14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0–9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8–12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3–11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74–1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32–2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. Interpretation Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

2460,Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis,"Summary Background In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. Findings Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–7·6) in those aged 80 years or older. Interpretation These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

2464,"Safety and immunogenicity of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine candidate for Middle East respiratory syndrome: an open-label, phase 1 trial","Summary Background The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a respiratory disease with a case fatality rate of up to 35%. Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. Methods This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18–55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5–30·0 kg/m2 and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 × 107 plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1 × 108 PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 Findings From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime–boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1–3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% CI 0·6960–0·9427], p=0·0001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. Interpretation Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime–boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose–effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

2477,Connecting clusters of COVID-19: an epidemiological and serological investigation,"Summary Background Elucidation of the chain of disease transmission and identification of the source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections are crucial for effective disease containment. We describe an epidemiological investigation that, with use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological assays, established links between three clusters of COVID-19. Methods In Singapore, active case-finding and contact tracing were undertaken for all COVID-19 cases. Diagnosis for acute disease was confirmed with RT-PCR testing. When epidemiological information suggested that people might have been nodes of disease transmission but had recovered from illness, SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology testing was used to establish past infection. Findings Three clusters of COVID-19, comprising 28 locally transmitted cases, were identified in Singapore; these clusters were from two churches (Church A and Church B) and a family gathering. The clusters in Church A and Church B were linked by an individual from Church A (A2), who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 infection to the primary case from Church B (F1) at a family gathering they both attended on Jan 25, 2020. All cases were confirmed by RT-PCR testing because they had active disease, except for A2, who at the time of testing had recovered from their illness and tested negative. This individual was eventually diagnosed with past infection by serological testing. ELISA assays showed an optical density of more than 1·4 for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain antigens in titres up to 1/400, and viral neutralisation was noted in titres up to 1/320. Interpretation Development and application of a serological assay has helped to establish connections between COVID-19 clusters in Singapore. Serological testing can have a crucial role in identifying convalescent cases or people with milder disease who might have been missed by other surveillance methods.

2482,"Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study","Summary Background Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. Methods From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6). Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Healthcare professionals are forced to make decisions in patient prioritization throughout specialties. Most pediatric urology pathologies do not require immediate or urgent care, however, delay may compromise future renal function or fertility. Contact with patients and parents, either physical in safe conditions or by (video)telephone must continue. The Paediatric-Urology-Guidelines-panel of the EAU proposes recommendations on prioritization of care. Pediatric-Urology program directors must ensure education, safety and attention for mental health of staff. Upon resumption of care, adequate prioritization must ensure minimal impact on outcome.","Quaedackers, Josine S.L.T.; Stein, Raimund; Bhatt, Nikita; Dogan, Hasan Serkan; Hoen, Lisette; Nijman, Rien J.M.; Radmayr, Christian; Silay, Mesrur Selcuk; Tekgul, Serdar; Bogaert, Guy",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpurol.2020.04.007,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

Method We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. Results Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. Conclusion Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.","Amrane, Sophie; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Doudier, Barbara; Eldin, Carole; Hocquart, Marie; Mailhe, Morgane; Dudouet, Pierre; Ormières, Etienne; Ailhaud, Lucie; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Brouqui, Philippe; Zandotti, Christine; Ninove, Laetitia; Luciani, Léa; Boschi, Céline; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier; Million, Matthieu; Colson, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

2523,YouTube as source of information on 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak: a cross sectional study of English and Mandarin content,"Abstract Background The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is rapidly evolving. YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and Mandarin languages. Methods YouTube was searched using the terms ‘2019 novel coronavirus’, ‘Wuhan virus’ and ‘武汉病毒’ (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. Results These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). Conclusions YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal International health agencies are underrepresented.

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Method Utilization of the available sequence information, homology modeling, and in slico docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 two main drug targets, the spike glycoprotein, and the 3CL protease. Results Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir show potential as and 3CLPRO main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment for COVID-19. Conclusion Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3CLPRO main proteinase. It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no “specific drug” available. Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”. China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.","Cao, Yu-chen; Deng, Qi-xin; Dai, Shi-xue",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia. Methods For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group. Conclusions This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation.

2537,"Epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus in Jiangsu Province, China after wartime control measures: A population-level retrospective study","Abstract Background A novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, and human-to-human transmission was previously identified. This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province. Methods Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020. Results The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases. The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%–58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined. The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou. The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people). The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province. The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases. Conclusion The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined. This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.","Wang, Ke-wei; Gao, Jie; Wang, Hua; Wu, Xiao-long; Yuan, Qin-fang; Guo, Fei-yu; Zhang, Zhi-jie; Cheng, Yang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05

2542,"Incidence of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China","Abstract Background Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in December, Chinese government has implemented various measures including travel bans, centralized treatments, and home quarantines to slowing the transmission across the country. In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. Results: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5‰ (95% CI: 0.31‰–4.37‰). Conclusion: Home quarantine has been effective in preventing the early transmission of COVID-19, but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of COVID-19 infection.","Wang, Jingzhong; Liao, Yi; Wang, Xiaoyang; Li, Yichong; Jiang, Dan; He, Jianfan; Zhang, Shunxiang; Xia, Junjie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101660,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101660,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101660,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Methods We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.","Gautret, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Parola, Philippe; Hoang, Van Thuan; Meddeb, Line; Sevestre, Jacques; Mailhe, Morgane; Doudier, Barbara; Aubry, Camille; Amrane, Sophie; Seng, Piseth; Hocquart, Marie; Eldin, Carole; Finance, Julie; Vieira, Vera Esteves; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé Tissot; Honoré, Stéphane; Stein, Andreas; Million, Matthieu; Colson, Philippe; La Scola, Bernard; Veit, Véronique; Jacquier, Alexis; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Drancourt, Michel; Fournier, Pierre Edouard; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

The laboratory investigations showed leukopenia and lymphopenia as well as increased creatinine and CRP levels. The first chest X-ray (faint bilateral patchy opacities) and CT scan (some faint subpleural ground-glass opacities associated with pleural thickening) were not typical for initial COVID-19 pulmonary infection, however, the treatment for COVID-19 was started. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation. After a while, the fetus was born with Apgar score of 0 and did not react to the neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol. Finally, due to deterioration in the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was expired as a result of multi-organ failure. Following the death, autopsy was performed and the histopathologic evaluations of the lungs showed evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness) and ARDS (hyaline membrane).

2552,Detection and analysis of nucleic acid in various biological samples of COVID-19 patients,"Abstract COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection. Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country. Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1–3]. Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low. However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples. Methods | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29. COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's 《pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) 》, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [4]. The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type. During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection. All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process. The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests. Results | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times). The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times). Discussion| In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs). Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.","Wu, Jianguo; Liu, Jiasheng; Li, Shijun; Peng, Zhiyang; Xiao, Zhe; Wang, Xufeng; Yan, Ruicheng; Luo, Jianfei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101673,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101673,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101673,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

2555,Challenges of managing the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract After an outbreak in Wuhan, China, a growing number of countries are now suffering from an epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States.Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that fatality due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units. Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARSCoV-2. Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus. While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers. Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established.In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed. Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention or being diagnosed as carriers. Thus, managing the asymptomatic cases, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while a pandemic is looming.","Rahimi, Farid; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101677,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101677,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101677,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

The implementation of strict measures for social distancing is challenging, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) due to its level of urbanization, its social and religious norms and its annual hosting of high visibility international religious mass gatherings. KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom. These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew. These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health. The effect of these actions on the epidemic curve of the Kingdom and on the global fight against COVID-19 remains to be seen. However, given the current COVID-19 situation, further bold and probably unpopular measures are likely to be introduced in the future.","Yezli, Saber; Khan, Anas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101692,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101692,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101692,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

2560,Mobile phones represent a pathway for microbial transmission: A scoping review,"Abstract Background Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern society. As possible breeding grounds for microbial organisms, these constitute a potential global public health risk for microbial transmission. Objective Scoping review of literature examining microbial's presence on mobile phones in both health care (HC) and community settings. Methods A search (PubMed&GoogleScholar) was conducted from January 2005–December 2019 to identify English language studies. Studies were included if samples from mobile phones were tested for bacteria, fungi, and/or viruses; and if the sampling was carried out in any HC setting, and/or within the general community. Any other studies exploring mobile phones that did not identify specific microorganisms were excluded. Results A total of 56 studies were included (from 24 countries). Most studies identified the presence of bacteria (54/56), while 16 studies reported the presence of fungi. One study focused solely on RNA viruses. Staphylococcus aureus, and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci were the most numerous identified organisms present on mobile phones. These two species and Escherichia coli were present in over a third of studies both in HC and community samples. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter sp., and Bacillus sp. were present in over a third of the studies in HC settings. Conclusions While this scoping review of literature regarding microbial identification on mobile phones in HC and community settings did not directly address the issue of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19, this work exposes the possible role of mobile phones as a ‘Trojan horse’ contributing to the transmission of microbial infections in epidemics and pandemics.","Olsen, Matthew; Campos, Mariana; Lohning, Anna; Jones, Peter; Legget, John; Bannach-Brown, Alexandra; McKirdy, Simon; Alghafri, Rashed; Tajouri, Lotti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101704,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101704,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101704,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

Using three criteria of research quality – rigour, originality and significance – it is shown how developing scenarios and analysing their implications present new, important research opportunities for PSM academics, practitioners, and leaders of the profession. Researching the future of PSM supports the identification of uncertainties and anticipates change across many units and levels of analysis of interest to PSM scholars and practitioners, such as the profession/discipline, markets/sectors, or organizations. Scenarios are particularly effective for: considering how the complex interaction of macro-environmental factors affects the PSM context; avoiding incremental thinking; surfacing assumptions and revealing significant blind spots. PSM research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia’s (2011) call for prescience-oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research, enhancing sense-giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice to better perform their adaptive role in society.","Knight, Louise; Meehan, Joanne; Tapinos, Efstathios; Menzies, Laura; Pfeiffer, Alexandra",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2020.100624,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2020.100624,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pursup.2020.100624,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

While specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death.

2573,Epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and interferon-regulated genes might suggest increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus patients,"Abstract Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specifically, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","Sawalha, Amr H.; Zhao, Ming; Coit, Patrick; Lu, Qianjin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

A significant proportion of adult patients require hospitalisation and may develop severe life-threatening complications. Children, on the other hand, can carry and transmit the virus, but usually do not develop severe disease. Mortality in the paediatric age-group is relatively low. Differences in virus containment and clearance, as well as reduced inflammation-related tissue and organ damage may be caused by age-specific environmental and host factors. Since severe complications in adults are frequently caused by uncontrolled immune responses and a resulting “cytokine storm” that may be controlled by targeted blockade of cytokines, previously established treatment with immunosuppressive treatments may indeed protect children from complications.","Hedrich, Christian M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108420,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108420,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108420,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

2576,COVID-19: Immunology and treatment options,"Abstract The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 causes COVID-19, a pandemic threatening millions. As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.","Felsenstein, Susanna; Herbert, Jenny A.; McNamara, Paul S.; Hedrich, Christian M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108448,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108448,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108448,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
2577,The first case of COVID-19 treated with the complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101,"Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating clinical manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia and is mainly based on an immune-driven pathology. Mounting evidence suggests that COVID-19 is fueled by a maladaptive host inflammatory response that involves excessive activation of innate immune pathways. While a “cytokine storm” involving IL-6 and other cytokines has been documented, complement C3 activation has been implicated as an initial effector mechanism that exacerbates lung injury in preclinical models of SARS-CoV infection. C3-targeted intervention may provide broader therapeutic control of complement-mediated inflammatory damage in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we report the clinical course of a patient with severe ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia who was safely and successfully treated with the compstatin-based complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101.","Mastaglio, Sara; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Risitano, Antonio M.; Angelillo, Piera; Yancopoulou, Despina; Mastellos, Dimitrios C.; Huber-Lang, Markus; Piemontese, Simona; Assanelli, Andrea; Garlanda, Cecilia; Lambris, John D.; Ciceri, Fabio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108450,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108450,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108450,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2580,Epilepsy and COVID-19: Associations and important considerations,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which initially occurred in Wuhan, China in late 2019, is now rapidly spreading globally. Epilepsy, a disease characterized by a spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, is a common chronic neurological condition. Associations between epilepsy and COVID-19 have not been reported. Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID-19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferences from past experiences of infectious diseases. We discuss the risk of COVID-19 for epilepsy patients, the effect of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients, and the importance of maintaining seizure control.

2587,THE GERIATRICIAN: THE FRONTLINE SPECIALIST IN THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 PATIENTS,"Abstract On February 20, 2020, a man living in the north of Italy was admitted to the emergency room with an atypical pneumonia that later proved to be COVID-19. This was the trigger of one of the most serious clusters of COVID-19 in the world, outside of China. Despite aggressive restraint and inhibition efforts, COVID-19 continues to increase, and the total number of infected patients in Italy is growing daily. After six weeks the total number of patients reached 128,948 cases (April 5, 2020), with the higher case-fatality rate (15,887 deaths) dominated by old and very old patients. This sudden health emergency severely challenged the Italian Health System, in particular acute care hospitals and intensive care units. In one hospital, geriatric observation units were created, the experience of which can be extremely useful for European countries, the United States, and all countries that in the coming days will face a similar situation.","Landi, F.; Barillaro, C.; Bellieni, A.; Brandi, V.; Carfì, A.; Cipriani, C.; D’Angelo, E.; Falsiroli, C.; Fusco, D.; Landi, G.; Liperoti, R.; Lo Monaco, M.R.; Martone, A.M.; Marzetti, E.; Pagano, F.; Pais, C.; Russo, A.; Salini, S.; Tosato, M.; Tummolo, A.M.; Benvenuto, F.; Bramato, G.; Catalano, L.; Ciciarello, F.; Martis, I.; Rocchi, S.; Rota, E.; Salerno, A.; Tritto, M.; Sgadari, A.; Zuccalà, G.; Bernabei, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.04.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.04.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamda.2020.04.017,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2589,INSMA: An Integrated System for Multimodal Data Acquisition and Analysis in the Intensive Care Unit,"Abstract Modern intensive care units (ICU) are equipped with a variety of different medical devices to monitor the physiological status of patients. These devices can generate large amounts of multimodal data daily that include physiological waveform signals (arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiration), patient alarm messages, numeric vitals data, etc. In order to provide opportunities for increasingly improved patient care, it is necessary to develop an effective data acquisition and analysis system that can assist clinicians and provide decision support at the patient bedside. Previous research has discussed various data collection methods, but a comprehensive solution for bedside data acquisition to analysis has not been achieved. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal data acquisition and analysis system called INSMA, with the ability to acquire, store, process, and visualize multiple types of data from the Philips IntelliVue patient monitor. We also discuss how the acquired data can be used for patient state tracking. INSMA is being tested in the ICU at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.","Sun, Yingcheng; Guo, Fei; Kaffashi, Farhad; Jacono, Frank J.; DeGeorgia, Michael; Loparo, Kenneth A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103434,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103434,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103434,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2603,"Diarrhea during COVID-19 infection: pathogenesis, epidemiology, prevention and management","Abstract Background and aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency. An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. Methods We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Conclusion Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.","D’Amico, Ferdinando; Baumgart, Daniel C.; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

2605,Diarrhea is associated with prolonged symptoms and viral carriage in COVID-19,"Abstract Background & Aims We compared clinical, laboratory, radiological, and outcome features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) with pneumonia, with vs without diarrhea. Methods We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real-time PCR. Results Of the 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 26 (31%) had diarrhea. The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P<.05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69%) than from patients without diarrhea (17%) (P<.001). As of February 19, a lower proportion of patients with diarrhea had a negative result from the latest throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 (77%) than patients without diarrhea (97%) (P=.010), during these patients’ hospitalization. Of 76 patients with a negative result from their latest throat swab test during hospitalization, a significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea had a positive result from the retest for SARS-CoV-2 in stool (45%) than patients without diarrhea (20%) (P=.039). Conclusions At a single center in Wuhan, China, 31% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had diarrhea. A significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea have virus RNA in stool than patients without diarrhea. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from stool takes longer than elimination from the nose and throat.","Wei, Xiao-Shan; Wang, Xu; Niu, Yi-Ran; Ye, Lin-Lin; Peng, Wen-Bei; Wang, Zi-Hao; Yang, Wei-Bing; Yang, Bo-Han; Zhang, Jian-Chu; Ma, Wan-Li; Wang, Xiao-Rong; Zhou, Qiong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.030,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

Setting The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. Practice description One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. Practice innovation The new COVID-19 “module” pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and “zero contact” pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform “WeChat.” This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. Evaluation With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. Results The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. Conclusion The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","Hua, XiaoLi; Gu, Ming; Zeng, Fang; Hu, Huiping; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Yu; Shi, Chen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.japh.2020.04.006,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

It also analyses the potential consequence of policy interventions, such as the US’ decision to implement a zero-percent interest rate and unlimited quantitative easing (QE), and how these policies may introduce further uncertainties into global financial markets.","Zhang, Dayong; Hu, Min; Ji, Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101528,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2020.101528,Elsevier,10.1016/j.frl.2020.101528,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

2616,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) CT Findings: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Abstract Purpose To date, considerable knowledge gaps remain regarding the chest CT imaging features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. Methods Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. Results A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). Conclusions The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25
2617,The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management and Infection Control in a Radiology Department,"Abstract Objective To describe the strategy and the emergency management and infection control procedure of our radiology department during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods We set up emergency management and sensing control teams. The team formulated various measures: reconfiguration of the radiology department, personal protection and training of staff, examination procedures for patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19 as well as patients without an exposure history or symptoms. Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were scanned in the designated fever-CT unit. Results From January 21, 2020, to March 9, 2020, 3,083 people suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 underwent fever-CT examinations. Including initial examinations and re-examinations, the total number of fever-CT examinations numbered 3,340. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the radiology department were infected with COVID-19. Conclusion Strategic planning and adequate protections can help protect patients and staff against a highly infectious disease while maintaining function at a high-volume capacity.","Huang, Zixing; Zhao, Shuang; Li, Zhenlin; Chen, Weixia; Zhao, Lihong; Deng, Lipeng; Song, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.011,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

2621,Coronavirus Outbreak: Is Radiology Ready? Mass Casualty Incident Planning,"Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months. Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department. A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19. Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection. The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training. Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission. The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.","Myers, Lee; Balakrishnan, Sudheer; Reddy, Sravanthi; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.025,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

2633,Management of Lung Nodules and Lung Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: CHEST Expert Panel Report,"Abstract Background The risks from potential exposure to COVID-19, and resource reallocation that has occurred to combat the pandemic, have altered the balance of benefits and harms that informed current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations for lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

2635,"SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes","Abstract Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic. In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs. We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.","Wu, Cheng-I.; Postema, Pieter G.; Arbelo, Elena; Behr, Elijah R.; Bezzina, Connie R.; Napolitano, Carlo; Robyns, Tomas; Probst, Vincent; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Remme, Carol Ann; Wilde, Arthur A.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

In this case report, we present a case of an 81-year-old solitary woman who received one year of visiting care service with Korean medicine treatments in a public health setting. During the one year, her pain severity (measured using numeric rating scale) remained moderate after her initial decline and her depressive symptoms and cognitive function scales (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Korean and the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Dementia Screening) remained almost unchanged; however, another cognitive function scale (Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) showed noticeable improvements.

2645,Medication treatment for opioid use disorder in expectant mothers (MOMs): Design considerations for a pragmatic randomized trial comparing extended-release and daily buprenorphine formulations,"Abstract Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has increased significantly in recent years. Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6–30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment.

2646,SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: How can pharmacists help?,"Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause disorders ranging from a mild cold to severe disease. Some of the CoVs are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans. In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of CoV that was named SARS-CoV-2 (standing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which has been classified as a high-consequence infectious disease. In addition, serious complications related to COVID-19 have been reported in some patients. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The pharmacist, as a healthcare practitioner, can play an important role in hindering the spread of COVID-19, and can be an active participant in national and community efforts to fight and contain this outbreak.","Al-Quteimat, Osama M.; Amer, Amer Mustafa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.018,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26
2647,How to link patients with suspicious COVID-19 to health system from the community pharmacies? A route proposal,"Abstract Colombia confirmed its first case of the COVID-19 on March 6th, 2020. On March 16th, 2020, 54 cases have been confirmed (36 imported and 18 associated), therefore, Colombia is at highest alert, and it is now trying to avoid or minimize the last stage of “community transmission”. We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process. Community pharmacies and pharmacy staff play a crucial role in minimizing the stage of “community transmission” of COVID-19, through properly detection and management of possible cases and customer education.","Amariles, Pedro; Ledezma-Morales, Mónica; Salazar-Ospina, Andrea; Hincapié-García, Jaime Alejandro",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.007,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

2649,"COVID-19 in Colombia endpoints. Are we different, like Europe?","Abstract The infection by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has taken the dimension of a pandemic, affecting more than 160 countries in a few weeks. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected. For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.","Amariles, Pedro; Granados, Johan; Ceballos, Mauricio; Montoya, Carlos Julio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
2650,On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists’ contribution during a public health crisis,"Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies and policy makers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19.","Cadogan, Cathal A.; Hughes, Carmel M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

2654,Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) framework for expanding pharmacy professionals’ roles and contributions to emergency preparedness and response during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,"Abstract Background Pharmacists have long been involved in public health and emergency preparedness and response (EP&R), including through preventive measures such as screening, vaccinations, testing and pharmaceutical countermeasures, as well as ensuring medication safety and access during natural disasters and pandemics. Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health intervention, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. Objective Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists’ skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Methods This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&R. The PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations’ Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, Health Departments and Emergency Preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. Results Based on the methods and resources utilized in developing this PEPR framework, five key focus areas were identified as follow: 1) Emergency preparedness and response 2) Operations management 3) Patient care and population health interventions 4) Public health pharmacy education and continuing professional education 5) Evaluation, research and dissemination for impact and outcomes Conclusion and Recommendations: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies. The PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&R.","Aruru, Meghana; Truong, Hoai-An; Clark, Suzanne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.002,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
2655,Drugs supply and pharmaceutical care management practices at a designated hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Abstract The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected at the end of December 2019. The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees. As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients. According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19. Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally.

2660,Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,"Abstract Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H.; Brown, Joshua D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
2661,"Media's effect on shaping knowledge, awareness risk perceptions and communication practices of pandemic COVID-19 among pharmacists","Abstract Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infection of the zoonotic coronavirus, is presenting a healthcare challenge around the globe. This study aims to assess the levels of disease knowledge and risk perception among pharmacists. We also recognize predictors of risk perception and perceived media roles. Methods This is a questionnaire-base cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was developed on a web-based platform and invitations were sent to pharmacists nationwide to participate in the study using social media applications. Results A total of 486 pharmacists participated in this study, where females were dominant (78.6%, n = 382). Most (40.4%, n = 198) pharmacists scored 4 out of 5 in basic disease knowledge, and more than half were able to recognize common methods of spread. Risk was highly perceived among participants, and was predicted by gender, living area, and having children (p < 0,05). Frequency of watching the media and sources of information also influenced both risk perception and perceived media roles. Conclusion Disease awareness among pharmacists, as well as risk perception must be considered for effective risk communication planning. The role of media in shaping perceptions should also be carefully studied to encourage compliance with government containment measures and engagement in preventive behaviors.","Karasneh, Reema; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Muflih, Suhaib; Soudah, Ola; Hawamdeh, Sahar; Khader, Yousef",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.027,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.027,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2690,"How inclusive are we, really?","Abstract Research has revealed that nurses and nursing students with disabilities experience discrimination. There are relatively few nurses with obvious physical disabilities working in clinical settings. Misconceptions abound regarding what a nurse with a disability can do. The focus tends to be on disability rather than ability. Similarly, prospective nursing students with disabilities are viewed with apprehension and caution. The overriding concern regarding nurses and nursing students with disabilities is that they will jeopardize patient safety. Nurse educators worry that students will not be able to complete the required skills and often confuse essential functions of nursing work with the academic standards required to graduate successfully. This article proposes that based on the research, we are not truly inclusive of nurses or nursing students with disabilities.","Neal-Boylan, Leslie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.teln.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.teln.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.teln.2020.04.006,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2692,Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status,"Abstract Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.","El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed Abd; Stockand, James D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104327,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104327,Elsevier,10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104327,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
2693,Emerging genetic diversity among clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: Lessons for today,"Abstract Considering the current pandemic of COVID-19, it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in SARS-CoV-2 with time, due to clinical and epidemiological concerns. Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism. As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation. We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome. We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.","Sheikh, Javaid Ahmad; Singh, Jasdeep; Singh, Hina; Jamal, Salma; Khubaib, Mohd.; Kohli, Sunil; Dobrindt, Ulrich; Rahman, Syed Asad; Ehtesham, Nasreen Zafar; Hasnain, Seyed Ehtesham",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104330,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104330,Elsevier,10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104330,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
2694,"The diagnostic and predictive role of NLR, d-NLR and PLR in COVID-19 patients","Abstract Aim To accumulate evidence that indicates the key role played by virus-triggered inflammation in the 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan City and rapidly spread throughout China. Methods Age, neutrophil(NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte(MON) ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR), and C-reactive protein(CRP) of 93 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were investigated and compared. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the thresholds for five bio-markers, and their prognostic values were assessed via the Kaplan–Meier curve and multivariate COX regression models. Results The median age was 46.4 years old, and 37cases were females. A total of 26.8% of patients had been to Wuhan, and 73.1% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (83.8%) and cough (70.9%) were the two most common symptoms. Elevated NLR and age were significantly associated with illness severity. The binary logistic analysis identified elevated NLR (hazard risk [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98–4.57) and age (HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.65–4.83) as independent factors for poor clinical outcome of COVID-19. NLR exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.841, with the highest specificity (63.6%) and sensitivity (88%). Conclusions Elevated age and NLR can be considered independent biomarkers for indicating poor clinical outcomes.","Yang, Ai-Ping; Liu, Jianping; Tao, Wenqiang; Li, Hui-ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106504,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106504,Elsevier,10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106504,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
2695,The possible of immunotherapy for COVID-19: A systematic review,"Abstract The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results.

2696,SARS-Cov-2 infection: response of human immune system and possible implications for the rapid test and treatment,"Abstract The new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of β−coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004. Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes. Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection. In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment. Lastly, we provided an overview of pharmacological treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Gabriella, di Mauro; Cristina, Scavone; Concetta, Rafaniello; Francesco, Rossi; Annalisa, Capuano",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106519,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106519,Elsevier,10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106519,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease. COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19. In this review we will critically analyse the evidences on either positive or negative effect of drugs commonly used to treat RA in this particular scenario, in order to optimize the current approach to RA patients.","Favalli, Ennio Giulio; Ingegnoli, Francesca; De Lucia, Orazio; Cincinelli, Gilberto; Cimaz, Rolando; Caporali, Roberto",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102523,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102523,Elsevier,10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102523,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

Our aim was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with cystic fibrosis. Methods: Anonymised data submitted by each participating country to their National CF Registry was reported using a standardised template, then collated and summarised. Results: 40 cases have been reported across 8 countries. Of the 40 cases, 31 (78%) were symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2 at presentation, with 24 (60%) having a fever. 70% have recovered, 30% remain unresolved at time of reporting, and no deaths have been submitted. Conclusions: This early report shows good recovery from SARS-CoV-2 in this heterogeneous CF cohort. The disease course does not seem to differ from the general population, but the current numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions and people with CF should continue to strictly follow public health advice to protect themselves from infection.","Cosgriff, Rebecca; Ahern, Susannah; Bell, Scott C.; Brownlee, Keith; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Byrnes, Cass; Corvol, Harriet; Cheng, Stephanie Y.; Elbert, Alexander; Faro, Albert; Goss, Christopher H.; Gulmans, Vincent; Marshall, Bruce C.; McKone, Edward; Middleton, Peter G.; Ruseckaite, Rasa; Stephenson, Anne L.; Carr, Siobhán B",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcf.2020.04.012,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
2703,Does the pathogenesis of SAR-CoV-2 virus decrease at high-altitude?,"Abstract In the present study we analyze the epidemiologic data of COVID-19 of Tibet and high-altitude regions of Bolivia and Ecuador, and compare to lowland data, to test the hypothesis that high-altitude inhabitants (+2500 m above sea-level) are less susceptible to develop severe adverse effect in acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Analysis of available epidemiological data suggest that physiological adaptations that counterbalance the hypoxic environment altitude may protect from severe impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Potential underlying mechanisms such as: (i) a compromised half-live of the virus caused by the high-altitude environment, and (ii) a hypoxia mediated down regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main binding target of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the pulmonary epithelia are discussed.","Arias-Reyes, Christian; Zubieta-DeUrioste, Natalia; Poma-Machicao, Liliana; Aliaga-Raudan, Fernanda; Carvajal-Rodriguez, Favio; Dutschmann, Mathias; Schneider-Gasser, EdithM.; Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo; Soliz, Jorge",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resp.2020.103443,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resp.2020.103443,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resp.2020.103443,22/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-22
2704,In vivo detection of circulating tumour cell clusters by photodiagnostic spectroscopy,"Abstract Background We demonstrate a new diagnostic method, Photodiagnostic Infrared Spectroscoppy (PDIS), which is able to detect circulating tumor clusters and circulating tumor cells in the circulatory system. Methods The PDIS method is based on photodiagnostic physics and high resolution spectroscopy and is using calibrated spectroscopic data for the diagnostic analysis of the blood screening spectra. Using Confocal Laser Scanning Mikcroscopy the Indocyangreen-uptake of different cell lines of breast cancer cells is studied. Results The PDIS supplies calibrated diagnostic data about the presence or absence of CTCs and CTC clusters in the bloodstream with a sensitivity of 98 %. Therefore, the PDIS is suited to control the blood of cancer patients with respect of CTC and CTC clusters with an resolution of one CTC and one CTC cluster per blood volume. PDIS distinguishes the different phenotypes of CTC clusters. Conclusion Circulating tumor cell slusters play a key role in the metastatic process and are formed only in solid tumors, they are appropriate objects to validate cancer treatments and to recognice cancer formation. The PDIS is a calibrated diagnostic method which allows to evaluate the results of solid tumor treatments and of chemotherapy treatments and to optimize the individual cancer treatment strategies.","Schikora, Detlef",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101755,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101755,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101755,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

2706,"El SARS-CoV-2, una nueva zoonosis pandémica que amenaza al mundo","Resumen El 31 de diciembre de 2019 se detectó en la ciudad de Wuhan (China) un brote de neumonía de etiología desconocida. Una semana después se aisló en estos pacientes un nuevo coronavirus, designado inicialmente como 2019-nCoV y posteriormente, SARS-CoV-2. Este es un nuevo virus que está mucho más próximo genéticamente a los coronavirus de los murciélagos que del SARS humano. El nuevo virus infecta y se replica en los neumocitos y macrófagos del parénquima pulmonar en los que reside el receptor celular ACE-2. Ha infectado en estos momentos muchas más personas que sus predecesores (>85.000). Desde el punto de vista clínico, los infectados presentan una edad media de 55 años; los síntomas principales son fiebre, tos seca, linfopenia, disnea, y neumonía en su forma grave. La tasa de letalidad global se sitúa en el 2-3% en China y en el 0,1% en los casos detectados fuera de este país. El período de incubación se ha establecido en unos 3 días (0-24 días). No se dispone de antivirales específicos ni de vacuna. Abstract On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in the city of Wuhan (China). A week later, a new coronavirus was isolated in these patients, initially designated as 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. This is a new virus that is much closer genetically to the coronavirus of bats than to human SARS. The new virus infects and replicates in the lung parenchyma pneumocytes and macrophages in which the ACE-2 cell receptor resides. He has now infected many more people than his predecessors (>85,000). From the clinical point of view, those infected have an average age of 55 years; the main symptoms are fever, dry cough, lymphopenia, dyspnea, and pneumonia in its severe form. The overall lethality rate is 2-3% in China and 0.1% in cases detected outside of this country. The incubation period has been set at about 3 days (0-24 days). There are no specific antivirals or vaccines.","Reina, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vacun.2020.03.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

2711,Screening for Active COVID-19 Infection and Immunization Status Prior to Biologic Therapy in IBD Patients at the Time of the Pandemic Outbreak,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 has been recently classified as pandemic infection by the World Health Organization. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are invited to follow the national recommendations as any other person. It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension. However, during pandemic, the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics should be postponed whenever possible and based on an individual risk assessment. When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion. Serum antibody testing, when available, could provide evidence of infection as well as identify patients already immune to the disease.","Zingone, Fabiana; Buda, Andrea; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.004,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

To face the new scenario all the hospitals have been re-organised in order to reduce all the outpatient services and to devote almost all their personnel and resources to the management of Covid-19 patients. As a matter of fact, all the services have undergone a deep re-organization guided by: the necessity to reduce exams, to create an environment that helps reduce the virus spread, and to preserve the medical personnel from infection. In these days a re-organization of the endoscopic unit, sited in a high-incidence area, has been adopted, with changes to logistics, work organization and patients selection. With the present manuscript, we want to support gastroenterologists and endoscopists in the organization of a “new” endoscopy unit that responds to the “new” scenario, while remaining fully aware that resources availability and local circumstances may extremely vary from unit to unit.","Elli, Luca; Rimondi, Alessandro; Scaramella, Lucia; Topa, Matilde; Vecchi, Maurizio; Mangioni, Davide; Gori, Andrea; Penagini, Roberto",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dld.2020.04.018,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

2720,Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update,"Abstract Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.","Patel, Dilan A.; Akinsete, Adeseye M.; de la Fuente, Josu; Kassim, Adetola A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.01.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.01.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.01.002,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12

2724,Pay attention to situation of SARS-CoV-2 and TCM advantages in treatment of novel coronavirus infection,"Abstract Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic, novel coronavirus has infected nearly 100,000 people in more than 110 countries. How to face this new coronavirus epidemic outbreak is an important issue. Basic reproduction number (R0) is an important parameter in epidemiology; The basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Epidemiology dynamics is a mathematical model based on a susceptibility-infection-recovery epidemic model. Researchers analyzed the epidemiological benefits of different transmission rates for the establishment of effective strategy in prevention and control strategies for epidemic infectious diseases. In this review, the early use of TCM for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal. Many TCM formulas and products have wide application in treating infectious and non-infectious diseases. The TCM theoretical system of treating epidemic diseases with TCM and the treatment scheme of integrated Chinese and Western medicine have proved their effectiveness in clinical practice. TCM can cure COVID-19 pneumonia, and also shows that the role of TCM in blocking the progress of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liu, Chang-xiao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chmed.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chmed.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chmed.2020.03.004,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

2726,Featuring COVID-19 cases via screening symptomatic patients with epidemiologic link during flu season in a medical center of central Taiwan,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CO-V-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China has now rapidly spread over 50 countries. For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. Methods Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. Results Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season. Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended.","Hsih, Wen-Hsin; Cheng, Meng-Yu; Ho, Mao-Wang; Chou, Chia-Huei; Lin, Po-Chang; Chi, Chih-Yu; Liao, Wei-Chih; Chen, Chih-Yu; Leong, Lih-Ying; Tien, Ni; Lai, Huan-Cheng; Lai, Yi-Chyi; Lu, Min-Chi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,13/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-13

2728,Internationally lost COVID-19 cases,"Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p < 0.01). Conclusions Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14

Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. Results Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","Xing, Yu-Han; Ni, Wei; Wu, Qin; Li, Wen-Jie; Li, Guo-Ju; Wang, Wen-Di; Tong, Jian-Ning; Song, Xiu-Feng; Wing-Kin Wong, Gary; Xing, Quan-Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
2734,Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis,"Abstract COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3′-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.","Mousavizadeh, Leila; Ghasemi, Sorayya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Most of the affected peoples had reached India from different part of the world, as like of carrier. Owing to this, India made several precautionary measures to mitigate/neglect the disease in beginning stage, however, the denser population of country will not be simple to control the same for long time (community spread), if government will not incorporate the visionary strategies. Since attacked several nations have been worried mostly for their people life (health), despite that developing country like India with huge population should consider about the livelihood (for Below Poverty Line (BPL) people), equally with the life.

2737,The association between international and domestic air traffic and the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"Abstract Background The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. Methods and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. Results Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2=0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2=0.98, p<0.01). Conclusions The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Zacharksi, Maciej; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
2738,Treatment options for COVID-19: the reality and challenges,"Abstract An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.","Jean, Shio-Shin; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
2739,Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19): A case series of early suspects reported and the implications towards the response to the pandemic in Zimbabwe,"Abstract Zimbabwe is among the countries that have been identified to be at risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the 15th of March 2020, there has been no confirmed case of the virus. Official reports of suspect cases were used to appraise the general screening, case management, and preparedness of the country towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at ports of entry, the country seems to be faring well. The country might not be screening optimally, considering the number of COVID-19 tests conducted to date and suspected cases who missed testing. Three of the suspected cases faced mental, social, and psychological consequences due to them being suspects of COVID-19. There is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all ports of entry. More COVID-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity. Training and awareness of mental, social, and psychological consequences of COVID-19 should be offered to health care workers and the public. More financial resources should be sourced to enable the country to control the pandemic.","Makurumidze, Richard",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.002,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13

After the announcement of lockdown in Italy on 9 March 2020, situation was becoming stable since last days of March. In view of this, it is important to forecast the COVID-19 evaluation of Italy condition and the possible effects, if this lock down could continue for another 60 days. Methods COVID-19 infected patient data has extracted from the Italian Health Ministry website includes registered and recovered cases from mid February to end March. Adoption of seasonal ARIMA forecasting package with R statistical model was done. Results Predictions were done with 93.75% of accuracy for registered case models and 84.4% of accuracy for recovered case models. The forecasting of infected patients could be reach the value of 182,757, and recovered cases could be registered value of 81,635 at end of May. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of country lockdown and self isolation in control the disease transmissibility among Italian population through data driven model analysis. Our findings suggest that nearly 35% decrement of registered cases and 66% growth of recovered cases will be possible.","Chintalapudi, Nalini; Battineni, Gopi; Amenta, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.004,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13

2747,A Cluster of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 Pneumonia Caused by SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract Background The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei, China, spreads across national and international borders. Methods We prospectively collected medical records of 14 health care workers (HCWs) who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, in neurosurgery department of Wuhan Union Hospital, China. Results Among the 14 HCWs, 12 were conformed cases, the other 2 were suspected cases. Most of them were either exposed to the two index patients or infected coworkers, without knowing they were COVID-19 patients. There were 4 male and 10 female infected HCWs in this cohort, whose mean age was 36 years (SD, 6 years). The main symptoms included myalgia or fatigue (100%), fever (86%) and dry cough (71%). On admission, 79% of infected HCWs showed leucopenia and 43% lymphopenia. Reduced complement C3 could be seen in 57% of the infected HCWs and IL-6 was significently elevated in 86% of them. The proportion of lymphocytes subsets, concentrations of immunoglobulins, complement C4, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ were within normal range in these 14 infected HCWs. The most frequent findings on pulmonary computed tomographic images were bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacifications (86%). Conclusions Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has occurred among HCWs, and most of these infected HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 are mild cases. Our data suggest that in the epidemic area of COVID-19, stringent and urgent surveillance and infection-control measures should be implemented to protect doctors and nurses from COVID-19 infection.","Wei, Xiao-Shan; Wang, Xiao-Rong; Zhang, Jian-Chu; Yang, Wei-Bing; Ma, Wan-Li; Yang, Bo-Han; Jiang, Nan-Chuan; Gao, Zhan-Cheng; Shi, Huan-Zhong; Zhou, Qiong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.013,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

Proponemos su uso, de cara a controlar el SDRA secundario a la infección por COVID-19. Abstract The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection fundamentally affects the lung field, causing ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS). This process is an inflammatory picture, involving an NLRP3 INFLAMOSOME-triggered cytokine storm, the main player in alveolar destruction. IL-1 beta stands out among the cytokines that are triggered in this picture. ANAKINRA is a potent biological drug, capable of blocking this IL 1 beta. We propose its use in controlling ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection.","Muñoz-Jiménez, Alejandro; Rubio-Romero, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.reuma.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reuma.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.reuma.2020.04.009,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

2765,Viral infections and multiple sclerosis,"The etiology and pathogenesis of MS is likely to involve multiple factors interacting with each other, and the role of infectious and viral agents is still under debate, however a consistent amount of studies suggests that some viruses are associated with the disease. The strongest documentation has come from the detection of viral nucleic acid or antigen or of an anti-viral antibody response in MS patients. A further step for the study of the mechanism viruses might be involved in can be made using in vitro and in vivo models. While in vitro models, based on glial and neural cell lines from various sources are widely used, in vivo animal models present challenges. Indeed neurotropic animal viruses are currently used to study demyelination in well-established models, but animal models of demyelination by human virus infection have only recently been developed, using animal gammaherpesviruses closely related to Epstein Barr virus (EBV), or using marmosets expressing the specific viral receptor for Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The present review will illustrate the main potential mechanisms of MS pathogenesis possibly associated with viral infections and viruses currently used to study demyelination in animal models. Then the viruses most strongly linked with MS will be discussed, in the perspective that more than one virus might have a role, with varying degrees of interaction, contributing to MS heterogeneity.","Donati, Donatella",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01
2766,Advancements in prophylactic and therapeutic nanovaccines,"Abstract Vaccines activate suitable immune responses to fight against diseases but can possess limitations such as compromised efficacy and immunogenic responses, poor stability, and requirement of adherence to multiple doses. ‘Nanovaccines’ have been explored to elicit a strong immune response with the advantages of nano-sized range, high antigen loading, enhanced immunogenicity, controlled antigen presentation, more retention in lymph nodes and promote patient compliance by a lower frequency of dosing. Various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines have the potential to induce both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity and can render long-lasting immunogenic memory. With such properties, nanovaccines have shown high potential for the prevention of infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Their therapeutic potential has also been explored in the treatment of cancer. The various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development and their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. Statement of Significance Interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system has opened multiple avenues to combat a variety of infectious and non-infectious pathological conditions. Limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. This review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines. The applications of nanovaccines in infectious and non-infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, influenza, and cancers have been discussed. It will help the readers develop an understanding of mechanisms of immune activation by nanovaccines and design appropriate strategies for novel nanovaccines.","Bhardwaj, Prateek; Bhatia, Eshant; Sharma, Shivam; Ahamad, Nadim; Banerjee, Rinti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05
2767,Changes in sexual behaviors of young women and men during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: a convenience sample from the epidemic area,"Abstract Background In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. Aim The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people’s sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic and explore the context in which they manifest. Methods A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. Outcomes The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people’s sexual behavior. Results While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. Clinical Implications The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. Strength & Limitations This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. Conclusion During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China.","Li, Weiran; Li, Guanjian; Xin, Cong; Wang, Yaochi; Yang, Sen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.380,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.380,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jsxm.2020.04.380,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

2770,Evidence Based Management Guideline for the COVID-19 Pandemic - Review article,"ABSTRACT COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic. To date, COVID-19 has affected over 944,181 people worldwide, resulting in over 47,312 reported deaths. Numerous preventative strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been employed to mitigate the spread of disease including careful infection control, the isolation of patients, and social distancing. Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate. As new findings emerge, there is an urgent need for up-to-date management guidelines. In response to this call, we review what is currently known regarding the management of COVID-19, and offer an evidence-based review of current practice.","Nicola, Maria; O’Neill, Niamh; Sohrabi, Catrin; Khan, Mehdi; Agha, Maliha; Agha, Riaz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.001,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions forced a decrease in the workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need of commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector has also seen a great demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.","Nicola, Maria; Alsafi, Zaid; Sohrabi, Catrin; Kerwan, Ahmed; Al-Jabir, Ahmed; Iosifidis, Christos; Agha, Maliha; Agha, Riaz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

Bacterial bloodstream infection is the most commonly diagnosed cause of febrile neutropenia, with Gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated. However, Gram-negative organisms are becoming more prevalent, with a worrying trend towards resistant organisms. When FN is prolonged, lasting for more than 5 days, there is an increased risk of invasive fungal infections. Prompt recognition, diagnosis and initiation of treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential to avoid complications and prevent rapid progression to sepsis and possible death.

2792,Stratégies de gestion de l’impact du confinement sur le sommeil : une synthèse d’experts,"Résumé En plus de l’impact psychologique du confinement et de l’épidémie, il existe des répercussions sur le sommeil qu’il faut prendre en compte par la mise en place de stratégies adaptées afin de maintenir un bon état de santé mental et de santé général. Le confinement peut désorganiser le sommeil en impactant, d’une part, les rythmes circadiens par une diminution de l’intensité des synchroniseurs extérieurs et, d’autre part, peut favoriser l’insomnie dans cette période de stress aigu. Enfin, le confinement peut être source d’une privation de sommeil chez ceux qui sont en première ligne et qui gèrent la crise. De plus, chez les enfants/adolescents le confinement peut également déstructurer les journées et ainsi avoir un impact sur la santé en générale. Pour cela, il est important de mettre en place certaines stratégies de préventions de ces perturbations de sommeil afin d’atténuer l’impact psychologique, infectieux et faire face de manière optimale à cette situation que nous vivons tous. Summary In addition to the psychological impact of quarantine, there are sleep disturbances that must be taken into account by implementing appropriate strategies in order to maintain good mental and general health. Quarantine can disrupt sleep first in impacting circadian rhythms by decreasing the intensity of zeitgebers, second can promote insomnia in this period of acute stress and third can be a source of sleep deprivation in those on the front line and managing the crisis. In addition, in children/adolescents, confinement can also destructure the days and thus have an impact on overall health. For this, it is important to put in place strategies to prevent these sleep disturbances in order to reduce the psychological, infectious impact and deal optimally with this situation that we are all experiencing.","Guichard, K.; Geoffroy, P.A.; Taillard, J.; Micoulaud-Franchi, J.-A.; Royant-Parola, S.; Poirot, I.; Brion, A.; d'Ortho, M-P.; Gagnadoux, F.; Schroder, C.; Philip, P.; Bioulac, S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msom.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msom.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.msom.2020.04.003,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

2812,An update on COVID-19 for the otorhinolaryngologist – a Brazilian Association of Otolaryngology and Cervicofacial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) Position Statement,"Abstract Introduction We are facing a pandemic with a great impact worldwide, as a result of the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. Methods Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. Results The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period. Conclusions We are still at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-CCF recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread.","Lavinsky, Joel; Kosugi, Eduardo Macoto; Baptistella, Eduardo; Roithman, Renato; Dolci, Eduardo; Ribeiro, Thais Knoll; Rossini, Bruno; Romano, Fabrizio Ricci; Maunsell, Rebecca Christina Kathleen; Mitre, Edson Ibrahim; Imamura, Rui; Hachya, Adriana; Chone, Carlos Takahiro; Watanabe, Luciana Miwa Nita; Fornazieri, Marco Aurélio; Lessa, Marcus Miranda; Sant’Anna, Geraldo Druck",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.04.002,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

Thirty-six day-old female Holstein calves with a birth weight of 43.4 ± 5.5 kg were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. On day 1, all calves received one portion (3 kg) of colostrum within 2 h after birth. Between the second feeding and the age of 5 days, control calves received only transition milk that had been collected from dams shortly before feeding, and the treatment group received 1.5 kg of colostrum collected from dams on day 1 and 1.5 kg of transition milk from subsequent milkings. Monthly body weight and average daily gain were used to measure growth performance. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at multiple time points to evaluate the biochemical and immune status of calves. Colostrum-supplemented transition milk increased the concentrations of serum immunoglobulins, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and total protein. The activity of lactate-dehydrogenase and ceruloplasmin decreased, whereas lysozyme activity increased with time in the control group. It can be concluded that additional five days of colostrum feeding positively influences non-specific humoral immunity indicators and serum biochemical parameters in dairy calves.","Zwierzchowski, Grzegorz; Miciński, Jan; Wójcik, Roman; Nowakowski, Jacek",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.103976,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.103976,Elsevier,10.1016/j.livsci.2020.103976,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. Aims and methods We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. Results Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs. Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Akriti; Shaikh, Altamash; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
2817,Estimation of effects of nationwide lockdown for containing coronavirus infection on worsening of glycosylated haemoglobin and increase in diabetes-related complications: A simulation model using multivariate regression analysis,"Abstract Introduction and aims: To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID19) total lockdown is in place in India from March 24, 2020 for 21 days. In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Materials and methods A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications. Results The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections. Conclusion The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia.","Ghosal, Samit; Sinha, Binayak; Majumder, Milan; Misra, Anoop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.014,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
2818,Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5–6 weeks,"Abstract Introduction and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. Material and methods Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. Results A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. Conclusion According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.","Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

2822,"Enhancing immunity in viral infections, with special emphasis on COVID-19: A review","Abstract Background and aims Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections. While data regarding nutrition in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are not available, in this review, we aimed to evaluated evidence from previous clinical trials that evaluated nutrition-based interventions for viral diseases (with special emphasis on respiratory infections), and summaries our observations. Methods A systematic search strategy was employed using keywords to search the literature in 3 key medical databases: PubMed®, Web of Science® and SciVerse Scopus®. Studies were considered eligible if they were controlled trials in humans, measuring immunological parameters, on viral and respiratory infections. Clinical trials on vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and probiotics were included. Results total of 640 records were identified initially and 22 studies were included from other sources. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 43 studies were obtained (vitamins: 13; minerals: 8; nutraceuticals: 18 and probiotics: 4). Among vitamins, A and D showed a potential benefit, especially in deficient populations. Among trace elements, selenium and zinc have also shown favourable immune-modulatory effects in viral respiratory infections. Several nutraceuticals and probiotics may have some role in enhancing immune functions. Micronutrients may be beneficial in nutritionally depleted elderly population. Conclusions We summaries possible benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and and probiotics.

2824,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): An overview of viral structure and host response,"Abstract Background and aim As a result of its rapid spread in various countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, WHO issued an announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status from epidemic to pandemic disease. The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body's responses and possible therapies. Method We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection. Conclusion In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease.","Astuti, Indwiani; Ysrafil, ",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.020,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

2831,Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review,"Abstract Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Mohamed, Ayman; Alawna, Motaz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2836,One train may hide another: Acute cardiovascular diseases could be neglected because of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely to have significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. In most countries, containment has already started (on 17 March 2020 in France), and self-quarantine and social distancing are reducing viral contamination and saving lives. However, these considerations may only be the tip of the iceberg; most resources are dedicated to the struggle against COVID-19, and this unprecedented situation may compromise the management of patients admitted with cardiovascular conditions. Aim We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 containment measures on cardiovascular admissions in France. Methods We asked nine major cardiology centres to give us an overview of admissions to their nine intensive cardiac care units for acute myocardial infarction or acute heart failure, before and after containment measures. Results Before containment (02–16 March 2020), the nine participating intensive cardiac care units admitted 4.8±1.6 patients per day, versus 2.6±1.5 after containment (17–22 March 2020) (rank-sum test P =0.0006). Conclusions We confirm here, for the first time, a dramatic drop in the number of cardiovascular admissions after the establishment of containment. Many hypotheses might explain this phenomenon, but we feel it is time raise the alarm about the risk for patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease, who may suffer from lack of attention, leading to severe consequences (an increase in the number of ambulatory myocardial infarctions, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction leading to an increase in the number of cardiac arrests, unexplained deaths, heart failure, etc.). Similar consequences can be feared for all acute situations, beyond the cardiovascular disease setting.","Huet, Fabien; Prieur, Cyril; Schurtz, Guillaume; Gerbaud, Edouard; Manzo-Silberman, Stéphane; Vanzetto, Gerald; Elbaz, Meyer; Tea, Victoria; Mercier, Grégoire; Lattuca, Benoît; Duflos, Claire; Roubille, François",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acvd.2020.04.002,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

2841,"Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in healthy adults in western Saudi Arabia, 2011–2016","Abstract Background The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized zoonotic coronavirus. Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. Methods Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. Results Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0–2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15–44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. Conclusions An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","Degnah, Afnan A.; Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S.; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Mirza, Ahmed A.; Hindawi, Salwa I.; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I.; Hashem, Anwar M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,28/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-28
2842,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated stress among medical students at a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Background and objectives Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students’ perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1–10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. Conclusions Medical students’ psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A.; Hasan, Gamal M.; Al-Zamil, Fahad; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Alsohime, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Saadi, Basma; Somily, Ali Mohammed",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27

2844,"Enhanced surveillance and response approaches for pilgrims and local Saudi populations against emerging Nipah, Zika and Ebola viral diseases outbreaks threats","Summary Increasing emergence and spread of Nipah, ZIKV and Ebola case and potential outbreaks threats have been reported in several regions around the globe. Yet, emerging Nipah, Ebola and Zika viral diseases outbreaks have been indirectly linked to substantially globalization of trade and travel, climate change and intense urbanization impact, healthcare and socioeconomic inequities as well in affected community settings. Although no case has been documented in Saudi Arabia, there is a great risk of sudden emergence of any of these viruses and others via introducing among pilgrims coming from endemic regions during ritual ceremonies of mass gatherings. Consequently, promoting and investing on new and sensitive proven effective and innovative surveillance and monitoring approaches, including enhanced risk communication, improved integrated vectors surveillance in addition to improved sustainable highly pathogens surveillance control programs to human motility and environmental sanitation strategies all represent ‘One Health’ approach implementation strategic core. Initiation, development and implementation leaded by Saudi government and international stakeholders’ of new partnership, coordinated response leadership and resource mobilization for multidisciplinary and intersectorial advocacy on emerging viral disease outbreaks, accompanied with R&D roadmap and taskforce is crucial. More efforts in epidemiological and laboratory early screening and surveillance of highly pathogenic germs/microbes, and confirmation of asymptomatic and syndromic cases amongst suspected Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, local vulnerable populations and expatriate workers is vital in generating reliable data and data sharing platform for timely risk communication and tourist information update, appropriate immunization campaigns or safe and efficacious care delivery implementation. Moreover, increase Hajj/Umrah mass gathering emergency outbreak preparedness, pilgrims health education and engagement outreach, pre-, during and post programs coverage and effectiveness is needed through One Health approach integration in attaining pilgrims and local population health safety and security, in advancing Saudi sustainable health development goals.","Tambo, Ernest; El-Dessouky, Ashraf G.; Khater, Emad I.M.; Xianonng, Zhou",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
2845,The first clusters of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Oman: Time to act,"Abstract Introduction Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance. This review describes the latest MERS-CoV clusters and the first cases of nosocomial transmission within health care facilities in Oman. We have highlighted lessons learned and proposed steps to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Methods A descriptive analysis of MERS-CoV cases was conducted between January 23 and February 16, 2019. The data from officials and other published sources used. Results Thirteen laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV were reported from three simultaneous clusters from two governorates without an epidemiological link between the clusters. Two clusters were reported from North Al Batinah Governorate, with nine cases (69%) and 1 cluster from South Ash Sharqiyah Governorate with four cases (31%). In total, four deaths were reported (case fatality rate 31%). Four cases (31%) reported were household contacts from the first cluster, 3 (23%) were nosocomial transmission in health care facilities (two for first and one from the second cluster) and 7 (54%) were community-acquired cases. Conclusions The first local clusters of MERS-CoV reported with evidence suggestive of healthcare and household-associated transmission. Early diagnosis and strict implementation of infection control measures remain fundamental in preventing and managing MERS-CoV infection.","Al Awaidy, Salah T.; Al Maqbali, Ali Abdullah; Omer, Iyad; Al Mukhaini, Suad; Al Risi, Mohammed Ali; Al Maqbali, Majed Sultan; Al Reesi, Ali; Al Busaidi, Mujahid; Al Hashmi, Fatma Hashim; Al Maqbali, Talib Khamis; Vaidya, Vidyanand; Al Risi, Elham Said Ahmed; Al Maqbali, Talib Khamis; Rashid, Ahmed Abdullah; Al Beloshi, Maryam Abdullah Hassan; Etemadi, Arash; Khamis, Faryal",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.002,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16
2846,A three-dimensional A549 cell culture model to study respiratory syncytial virus infections,"Abstract Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting infants, young children, and immune-compromised patients; however, currently no vaccine is available for prevention of RSV infections. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis. Methods To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra-low attachment plates to generate 25 × 103 cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation. Results Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time-dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV-F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3-fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post-inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post-inoculation. Conclusions Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro.","Saleh, Fatima; Harb, Aya; Soudani, Nadia; Zaraket, Hassan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.011,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported globally. Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute a variety of control measures. We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic. In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control and preventions strategies are all reviewed.","Harapan, Harapan; Itoh, Naoya; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Keam, Synat; Te, Haypheng; Megawati, Dewi; Hayati, Zinatul; Wagner, Abram L.; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.019,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
2848,Unlikely SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission from mother to child: A case report,"Abstract As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread across China and to more than 70 countries, an increasing number of pregnant women were affected. The vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great concern to the obstetrics, neonatologists, and public health agencies. Though some studies indicated the risk of vertical transmission is low, few cases have been reported with comprehensive serial tests from multiple specimens. In this case, a female preterm infant was born to a mother with confirmed COVID-19. She presented with mild respiratory distress and received general management and a short period of nasal continuous positive airway pressure support. During her stay at the hospital, a series of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic test from her throat and anal swab, serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and urine were negative. The nucleic acid test from the mother's amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, cord blood, placenta, serum, anal swab, and breast milk were also negative. The most comprehensively tested case reported to date confirmed that the vertical transmission of COVID is unlikely, but still, more evidence is needed.","Peng, Zhoujie; Wang, Jianhui; Mo, Yunbo; Duan, Wei; Xiang, Guangjun; Yi, Ming; Bao, Lei; Shi, Yuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.004,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11
2849,"Demographic, clinical, and outcomes of confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA); A retrospective record based study","Abstract Introduction MERS is caused by a viral infection, which was first identified in KSA, 2012. MERS-CoV infection consequences with either hospitalization or death. Methods All positive MERS-CoV cases that diagnosed in and reported to a referral hospital in Najran, KSA from March/2014 to December/2018 were revised retrospectively. We identified patients from infection control department and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. Results Of the 54 positive MERS-CoV cases, 3 cases were excluded because no available data. Therefore, the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases (94.4). Most of the patients were Saudi 36 (70.6%), and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 (35.3) season. Fever 47 (92.2%), cough 44 (86.3%), and shortness of breath 37 (72.5%) were reported as most common symptoms. Most patients had DM and hypertension. Overall mortality rate was 37.3%, and interestingly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years. In logistic regression analysis, Season and Chronic Kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistically significantly associated with death. The odds of death the patients infected by MERS-CoV during Autumn and Winter season were 4.09 times higher than those patients who infected during Spring and Summer season (OR = 4.09, CI 1.18-14.15, P < 0.026). Compared with MERS-CoV patients who had Non-Chronic kidney diseases, the odds of death the MERS-CoV patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18.08 times higher (OR = 18.08, CI -2.01-162.99, P < 0.01). Conclusion The mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection was high. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the reasons behind the decrease in the mortality rate over the time period.","Al Sulayyim, Hadi J.; Khorshid, Sherif Mohamed; Al Moummar, Satam H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.04.007,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

2868,"Study of knowledge, attitude, anxiety & perceived mental healthcare need in Indian population during COVID-19 pandemic","Abstract Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants.

2885,Highlights of traditional Chinese medicine frontline expert advice in the China national guideline for COVID-19,"Abstract Introduction The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold. As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese–Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline. Methods The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world. Results We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients’ disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases. Conclusion To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.","Ho, Leonard T.F.; Chan, Karina K.H.; Chung, Vincent C.H.; Leung, Ting Hung",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

2887,Urticaire de l’enfant,"Résumé L’incidence cumulée de l’urticaire chez l’enfant est proche de 10 %. On décrit la forme superficielle et la forme profonde, ou angioedème. Chez le jeune enfant de moins de 3 ans, l’urticaire est volontiers annulaire et ecchymotique et prise à tort pour un érythème polymorphe ou un œdème aigu hémorragique. La pseudo-maladie sérique est une forme particulière d’urticaire caractérisée par un angioedème des extrémités, une fièvre et des arthralgies, la principale cause est médicamenteuse (céphalosporines). Chez l’enfant, l’interrogatoire et l’examen clinique sont essentiels et permettent dans la plupart des cas de mettre en évidence une étiologie. Les principales causes d’urticaire aiguë ou récidivante sont les infections virales et/ou les médicaments (histaminolibération non spécifique), alors que les urticaires chroniques sont majoritairement de cause physique. Dans les pays développés, les infections parasitaires sont rarement en cause. Les arguments en faveur d’une allergie alimentaire sont : un contexte d’atopie, la survenue dans l’heure suivant la prise de l’aliment suspect, l’absence de fièvre ou de contexte infectieux, la durée inférieure à 24heures, l’association éventuelle à d’autres manifestations d’anaphylaxie et la récidive à chaque nouvelle prise de l’aliment suspect. Le traitement de première intention d’une urticaire sans signe de gravité se limite à la prescription d’un antihistaminique non sédatif (associé à l’éviction de la cause lorsque celle-ci est déterminée). Près d’un tiers des cas d’urticaire de l’enfant évolue sur une durée prolongée de plus de 6 semaines, définissant l’urticaire chronique (le plus souvent à type d’urticaire récidivante bénigne lors des épisodes infectieux et/ou la prise de médicaments). Il est très rare qu’une urticaire, même chronique, révèle une maladie inflammatoire ou une maladie génétique comme une cryopyrinopathie, le bilan étiologique de première intention se limite habituellement aux examens suivants : NFS, VS et/ou CRP, transaminases. Abstract The cumulative incidence of urticaria in children is close to 10%. Two forms are described: the superficial form and the deep form, or angioedema. In young children aged under 3 years, urticaria is commonly annular and ecchymotic, and is mistaken for erythema multiforme or acute hemorrhagic edema. Serum sickness-like reaction is a particular form of urticaria characterized by angioedema of the extremities, fever and arthralgia, and it is chiefly drug-induced (cephalosporins). With children, questioning and clinical examination are essential and, in most cases, reveal an etiology. The main causes of acute or recurrent urticaria are viral infections and/or drugs (non-specific histamine release), whereas chronic urticaria is mostly due to physical causes. In developed countries, parasitic infections are rarely the cause. Arguments in favor of a food allergy are as follows: a setting of atopy, onset within one hour of taking the suspect food, absence of fever or infection, a duration of less than 24hours, possible association with other signs of anaphylaxis, and further recurrence with each new intake of the suspect food. First-line treatment of urticaria without signs of severity consists solely of non-sedating antihistamine (associated with removal of the cause where the latter has been determined). Nearly one-third of cases of urticaria in children progress over a prolonged period of more than 6 weeks, thus constituting chronic urticaria (most often a form of mild recurrent urticaria during episodes of infection and/or medication). Chronic urticaria is very rarely due to an underlying inflammatory disease or a genetic disease such as cryopyrinopathy, and first-line etiological assessment is usually limited to the following tests: CBC, sedimentation speed and/or CRP, and transaminases.","Boralevi, F.; Léauté-Labrèze, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.reval.2020.02.239,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reval.2020.02.239,Elsevier,10.1016/j.reval.2020.02.239,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

Such dynamic behavior of IDPs earned the name “Dancing Proteins.” The exploration of these dancing proteins in viruses has just started and crucial details such as correlation of rapid evolution, high rate of mutation and accumulation of disordered contents in viral proteome at least understood partially. In order to gain a complete understanding of this correlation, there is a need to decipher the complexity of viral mediated cell hijacking and pathogenesis in the host organism. Further there is necessity to identify the specific patterns within viral and host IDPs such as aggregation; Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) and their association to virulence, host range and rate of evolution of viruses in order to tackle the viral-mediated diseases. The current book chapter summarizes the aforementioned details and suggests the novel opportunities for further research of IDPs senses in viruses.","Mishra, Pushpendra Mani; Verma, Navneet Chandra; Rao, Chethana; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Nandi, Chayan Kanti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02
2892,Microbiota in viral infection and disease in humans and farm animals,"Abstract The influence of the microbiota on viral infection susceptibility and disease outcome is undisputable although varies among viruses. The purpose of understanding the interactions between microbiota, virus, and host is to identify practical, effective, and safe approaches that target microbiota for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases in humans and animals, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. The initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences, focusing on the viral pathogens—from human and animal studies—that have already been shown to interact with microbiota. The subsequent step is to identify mechanisms, through experimental evidences, to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota. In this chapter, we review evidences of virus infections altering microbiota and of microbiota enhancing or suppressing infectivity, altering host susceptibility to certain viral diseases, and influencing vaccine immunogenicity in humans and farm animals.","Yuan, Lijuan; Hensley, Casey; Mahsoub, Hassan M.; Ramesh, Ashwin K.; Zhou, Peng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.005,Elsevier,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.005,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

2895,Stratégie pour la pratique de la chirurgie digestive et oncologique en situation d’épidémie de COVID-19,"Résumé La pandémie due au COVID-19 modifie l’organisation des soins et change la réalisation de la chirurgie digestive. Les priorités sanitaires et les circuits de soins sont modifiés. La chirurgie d’urgence reste prioritaire. Les interventions pour chirurgie fonctionnelles sont à reporter. La chirurgie par laparoscopie doit suivre des règles strictes pour ne pas exposer les professionnels à un surrisque. Le questionnement principal concerne la chirurgie oncologique, opérer ou reporter ? Il existe probablement un sur risque opératoire induit par la pandémie qui doit être mis en balance avec le retard de prise en charge chirurgical. Pour chaque type de cancer, colon, pancréas, œsogastrique, hépatocarcinome, la morbi-mortalité est rappelée et mise en parallèle avec le risque oncologique lié au retard à la chirurgie et/ou au temps de doublement de la tumeur. Cette comparaison permet de proposer des stratégies, ainsi pour les cancers coliques (T1-2, N0), il est souhaitable de retarder la chirurgie. Pour les lésions coliques avancées, il semble prudent de recommander une chimiothérapie néo adjuvante et d’attendre. Pour les cancers du rectum T3-4 et/ou N+, une radio-chimiothérapie est indiquée, une radiothérapie courte devra être discutée (suivie d’une période d’attente) afin de réduire le temps d’exposition à l’hôpital et d’éviter les infections. La majorité des chirurgies complexes à forte morbi-mortalité, œsogastrique, hépatique ou pancréatique doivent sans doute le plus souvent être reportée. Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery – go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer – colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma – morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3–4 and /or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality – oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic – is most often best deferred.","Tuech, J.-J.; Gangloff, A.; Di Fiore, F.; Michel, P.; Brigand, C.; Slim, K.; Pocard, M.; Schwarz, L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

2900,Risques de contamination virale des soignants au cours d’une laparoscopie pendant la pandémie de la Covid-19,"Résumé La pandémie de la Covid-19 a notablement modifié nos pratiques. Le but de cet article était d’analyser les risques de contamination des soignants au cours des interventions laparoscopiques réalisées chez des patients atteints de Covid-19. L’effet délétère de l’aérosolisation du pneumopéritoine avec présence du virus n’est actuellement pas quantifié. Même si les mesures de protection des soignants sont une extrapolation des mesures prises pour d’autres épidémies, elles doivent être de rigueur afin de minimiser le risque de contamination virale. Les mesures de protection sont les équipements de protection individuelle des soignants, l’adaptation de la technique chirurgicale (méthode de création du pneumopéritoine, filtres, anastomoses plutôt intracorporelles, précautions lors de l’exsufflation du pneumopéritoine), et l’organisation de la salle d’opération. Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic has markedly changed our practices. This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.","Veziant, J.; Bourdel, N.; Slim, K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.008,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

Il est souhaitable de prioriser les pathologies pour lesquelles la chirurgie de cytoréduction associée ou non à une chimiohyperthermie intrapéritonéale (CHIP) est le traitement de référence et celles pour lesquelles la chimiothérapie systémique ne peut être une alternative temporaire ou prolongée : pseudomyxomes péritonéaux; mésothéliomes péritonéaux malins résécables ; métastases péritonéales d’origine colorectale si résécables, non répondeuses à la chimiothérapie systémique et/ou après 12 cures, carcinoses ovariennes en 1ère intention si résécables et limitées ou en situation intervallaire après un maximum de 6 cycles de chimiothérapie systémique. L’adjonction d’une CHIP devra être discutée au cas par cas, en centre expert. La priorisation des indications devra prendre en considération les conditions locales et la phase de la période épidémique pour permettre une prise en charge péri-opératoire optimale. Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy. Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center. The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.","Glehen, O.; Kepenekian, V.; Bouché, O.; Gladieff, L.; Honore, C.; Big-Renape, Renape -",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.011,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
2904,Infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2 dans les services de Chirurgie Digestive,"RESUME Introduction: La pandémie de COVID-19 a imposé une diminution radicale de l’activité chirurgicale afin de répondre à l’afflux de patients hospitalisés et protéger les patients non infectés en leur évitant une hospitalisation. Toutefois, le risque d’infection lors de l’hospitalisation et ses conséquences sont encore très peu connus. Le but de ce travail était de rapporter une série de patients hospitalisés en chirurgie digestive chez qui une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2 a été diagnostiquée. Méthodes: Etude rétrospective non-interventionnelle réalisée au sein de 3 services de chirurgie digestive. Les données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques des patients ayant développé une infection nosocomiale au SARS-Cov-2 ont été collectées à partir des dossiers informatisés. Résultats: Du 1er Mars 2020 au 5 Avril 2020, parmi 305 patients admis en chirurgie digestive, 15 (4.9%) ont présenté une infection nosocomiale à SARS-Cov-2. Il s’agissait de 9 hommes et 6 femmes, d’un âge médian de 62 ans (35-68 ans). Tous les patients présentaient une comorbidité. Les motifs d’hospitalisation étaient : traitement chirurgical d’un cancer (n=5), urgences complexes (n=5), traitement de complications liées au cancer ou à son traitement (n=3), reconstruction par gastroplastie (n=1), fermeture de stomie (n=1). Le délai médian entre l’admission et le diagnostic d’infection à SARS-Cov-2 était de 34 jours (5-61 jours). Chez 12 (80%) patients, le diagnostic a été posé après une durée d’hospitalisation de plus de 14 jours (15-63 jours). A l’issue du suivi, 2 patients sont décédés, 7 étaient hospitalisés dont 2 sous assistance respiratoire et 6 patients étaient sortis d’hospitalisation. Conclusions: Le risque d’infection au SARS-Cov-2 au cours d’une hospitalisation ou dans les suites d’une intervention de chirurgie digestive est un risque réel et potentiellement grave. Des mesures sont nécessaires afin de minimiser ce risque dans la perspective d’une reprise de l’activité chirurgicale en toute sécurité. SUMMARY Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","Luong-Nguyen, Minh; Hermand, Hélène; Abdalla, Solafah; Cabrit, Nicolas; Hobeika, Christian; Brouquet, Antoine; Goéré, Diane; Sauvanet, Alain",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.012,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
2905,Que doivent savoir les chirurgiens à propos des troubles digestifs et des anomalies paracliniques induits par le COVID 19?,"Resume Les symptômes liés au COVID-19 sont principalement caractérisés par la triade fièvre, toux sèche et dyspnée. Toutefois, des symptômes digestifs ont également été rapportés dont la fréquence initialement considérée comme faible semble toucher plus de la moitié des patients à des degrés divers. Ceux-ci se manifestent principalement par une anorexie, une diarrhée, des nausées et ou vomissements et des douleurs abdominales. Bien que le pronostic soit lié à l’atteinte pulmonaire, les troubles digestifs semblent significativement plus fréquents chez les patients ayant une infection sévère à COVID-19. Des formes digestives isolées ou pouvant précéder les symptômes pulmonaires sont désormais bien décrites avec de la diarrhée au premier plan clinique. Les principales anomalies biologiques pouvant orienter précocement vers une infection à COVID-19 sont la lymphopénie, une CRP augmentée et une augmentation des transaminases prédominant sur les ASAT. Le scanner thoraco-abdominal semble utile dans ce cas pour éliminer une pathologie digestive non liée au coronavirus et pour rechercher des images pulmonaires compatibles avec une infection à COVID-19. Il n’existe pas de données sur l’intérêt de l’endoscopie digestive en cas de symptômes digestifs persistants. Le risque de contamination de l’endoscopiste semble par ailleurs significatif. Un mode de transmission oro-fécale de l’infection est possible ce d’autant que l’excrétion virale dans les selles semblent fréquente et durer plus longtemps qu’au niveau ORL, y compris chez des patients avec prélèvement pharyngé négatif ou sans symptômes digestifs. Ainsi, dans certains cas douteux, une analyse virologique des selles peut permettre de porter un diagnostic de certitude. La contagiosité persistante d’un patient en cas d’excrétion virale prolongée dans les selles est possible mais pas parfaitement établi. L’avènement proche de la sérologie devrait permettre d’identifier les malades ayant été infectés par l’épidémie de COVID-19 notamment les sujets pauci-symptomatiques non détectés au sein du personnel de santé. La reprise de l’activité médico-chirurgicale devra faire l’objet d’une stratégie dédiée en amont du déconfinement. Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient’s persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff.

2906,Strategy for the practice of digestive and oncological surgery during the Covid-19 epidemic,"Summary The Covid-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery–go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer–colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma–morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3-4 and/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality–oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic–is most often best deferred.","Tuech, J.-J.; Gangloff, A.; Di Fiore, F.; Michel, P.; Brigand, C.; Slim, K.; Pocard, M.; Schwarz, L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.03.008,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.","Veziant, J; Bourdel, N; Slim, K",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.010,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

2914,Antibiotics alone as an alternative to appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: changes in treatment modalities related to the COVID-19 health crisis,"Summary The massive inflow of patients with COVID-19 requiring urgent care has overloaded hospitals in France and impacts the management of other patients. Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system. It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient. Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis. The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","Collard, Maxime; Lefevre, Jérémie H.; Maggiori, Léon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.014,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

Méthodes: ces conseils ont été rédigés sur la base de l'expérience clinique des experts sollicités pour la rédaction de manuscrit, ainsi que sur les recommandations de pratique clinique et publications disponibles sur le sujet dans la littérature. Les propositions feront l'objet de mises à jour en fonction de l'évolution des connaissances sur cette épidémie. Résultats: l’incidence des formes symptomatiques d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 chez l’enfant est faible (1–5%) et le pronostic est bon. Les indications de fibroscopies en consultation doivent être réduites aux seuls cas indispensables et ne pouvant être différés. Leur réalisation doit être entourée de précautions maximales, avec notamment port d’un masque FFP2 (Filtering FacePiece type 2). Les mêmes précautions s’appliquent aux lavages de nez au sérum salé lorsqu’ils sont pratiqués en milieu hospitalier, ainsi qu’aux soins de trachéotomie. Concernant les suspicions de corps étrangers inhalés et en dehors des cas cliniquement évidents, il est recommandé de prescrire un scanner thoracique avant de programmer une éventuelle endoscopie sous anesthésie générale. Les indications chirurgicales doivent se limiter aux urgences et aux cas ne pouvant être différés de plus de deux mois, particulièrement si ces chirurgies concernent les voies aériennes et notamment les fosses nasales et le cavum. Les décisions doivent idéalement être prises collégialement et notées par écrit. Les techniques chirurgicales doivent être adaptées aux risques de dissémination virale.

2938,French consensus on management of head and neck cancer surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT In the context of the current pandemic, there is a need for specific advice concerning treatment of patients with Head and Neck cancers. The rule is to limit as much as possible the number of patients in order to reduce the risks of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus for both patients and the caregivers, who are particularly exposed in ENT. The aim is to minimize the risk of loss of opportunity for patients and to anticipate the increased number of cancer patients to be treated at the end of the pandemic, taking into account the degree of urgency, the difficulty of the surgery, the risk of contaminating the caregivers (tracheotomy) and the local situation (whether or not the hospital and intensive care departments are overstretched).","Fakhry, N; Schultz, P; Morinière, S; Breuskin, I; Bozec, A; Vergez, S; de Garbory, L; Hartl, D; Temam, S; Lescanne, E; Couloigner, V; Barry, B",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.008,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

2940,COVID-19 and ENT Pediatric otolaryngology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines of the French Association of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology (AFOP) and French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL),"ABSTRACT Objective: joint guidelines of the French Pediatric Otolaryngology Society (AFOP) and of the French Society of otorhinolaryngology – Head and neck Surgery (SFORL) on the management of paediatric otolaryngology patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A nation-wide workgroup drew guidelines based on clinical experience, national and local recommendations and scientific literature. Proposals may have to be updated on a day-to-day basis. Results: In children, incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 (1-5%) is low and of good prognosis. The indications for nasal flexible endoscopy should be drastically limited. If undertaken, full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks are required, as well as use of a sheath. Saline nose wash done by caregivers other than parents at home should require PPE. Unless foreign body tracheobronchial aspiration is clinically obvious, CT-scan should be performed to confirm indication of endoscopy. Surgical indications should be limited to emergencies and to cases that cannot be delayed beyond 2 months (especially endonasal, endopharyngeal laryngo-tracheobronchial procedures). Postponement should ideally be a group decision and recorded as such in the medical file. Surgical techniques should be adapted to limit the risk of viral dissemination in the air, avoiding the use of drills, microdebriders, monopolar cautery or lasers. Continuous suction should be placed near the operating field. In case of confirmed Covid-19 cases, or suspected cases (or in some centres systematically), PPE with FFP2 mask should be worn by all staff members present in the operating room.","Leboulanger, N; Sagardoy, T; Akkari, M; Ayari-Khalfallah, S; Celerier, C; Fayoux, P; Luscan, R; Mansbach, A L; Moreddu, E; Pondaven, S; Simon, F; Teissier, N; Thierry, B; Fanoux, A; Lescanne, E; Nicollas, R; Couloigner, V",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.010,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18
2941,Guidelines of clinical practice for the management of swallowing disorders and recent dysphonia in the contexte of the COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT Procedures putting healthcare workers in close contact with the airway are particularly at risk of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, especially when exposed to sputum, coughing, or a tracheostomy. In the current pandemic phase, all patients should be considered as potentially infected. Thus, the level of precaution recommended for the caregivers depends more on the type of procedure than on the patient's proved or suspected COVID-19 status. Procedures that are particularly at high risk of contamination are clinical and flexible endoscopic pharyngo-laryngological evaluation, and probably also video fluoroscopic swallowing exams. Voice rehabilitation should not be considered urgent at this time. Therefore, recommendations presented here mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders, which can sometimes be dangerous for the patient, and recent dysphonia. In cases where they are considered possible and useful, teleconsultations should be preferred to face-to-face assessments or rehabilitation sessions. The latter must be maintained only in few selected situations, after team discussions or in accordance with the guidelines provided by health authorities.","Mattei, A.; Amy de la Bretèque, B; Crestani, S.; Crevier-Buchman, L.; Galant, C.; Hans, S.; Julien-Laferrière, A.; Lagier, A.; Lobryeau, C.; Marmouset, F.; Robert, D.; Woisard, V.; Giovanni, A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.011,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
2942,COVID-19 and ENT Surgery,"ABSTRACT In Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, clinical examination and invasive procedures on the respiratory tract and on airway-connected cavities such as paranasal sinuses and the middle ear expose people to direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation or ocular projection of contaminated droplets, and to indirect transmission by contact with contaminated hands, objects or surfaces. Estimating an R0 of Covid-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown. The health authority recommends cancellation of all medical or surgical activities which are not urgent as long as this does not involve a loss of chance for the patient. The purpose of this cancellation is to significantly increase critical care capacity, prioritize the reception of patients with Covid-19, prioritize the allocation of staff and provision of the equipment necessary for their medical or surgical management, and contribute to the smooth running of downstream critical care within their establishment. Another goal is to reduce the risks of patient contamination within healthcare facilities. This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations. This best practice advice must of course be adapted in each region according to the development of the epidemic and pre-existing arrangements. Their local application can only be decided within the framework of collaboration between the ENT teams, the operational hygiene units and all the other specialties concerned.","Couloigner, V.; Schmerber, S.; Nicollas, R.; Coste, A.; Barry, B.; Makeieff, M.; Boudard, P.; Bequignon, E.; Morel, N.; Lescanne, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anorl.2020.04.012,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

2954,LA PSIQUIATRÍA EN LAS SECUELAS DE COVID-19,"Resumen La pandemia por Covid-19 ha obligado a modificar sustancialmente la forma de trabajar de los profesionales de la salud mental y puede tener un impacto diferido sobre los pacientes. La Psiquiatría post-Covid-19 pondrá en valor la especialidad como parte de la medicina, los aspectos psicológicos de la práctica médica, la psiquiatría de enlace e interconsulta hospitalaria, la atención domiciliaria, y la atención ambulatoria virtual o telemática. Las consecuencias del confinamiento poblacional, el duelo por las muertes solitarias, y el impacto de la crisis sanitaria sobre los profesionales de la salud mental, desde los dispositivos hospitalarios hasta los comunitarios, de rehabilitación, y la atención primaria, centrarán nuestros esfuerzos durante el desescalado y el medio plazo. Es previsible un aumento de la demanda de atención psiquiátrica a medio y largo plazo y un impacto en la docencia e investigación en salud mental. Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has forced mental health professionals to substantially change the way they work and may have a delayed impact on patients. The aftermath of COVID-19 will shine a light on certain aspects of psychiatry addressed in this article: psychiatry as a medical specialty, the psychological aspects of medical practice, liaison and consultative psychiatry, home hospitalization, and virtual or telemedicine outpatient care. The consequences of population lockdown, complicated grief over solitary deaths, and the impact of the health crisis on mental health professionals – from hospitals to community services, rehabilitation facilities, and primary care – will be the focus of our efforts during the period of lockdown easing and in the medium term. There will be a foreseeable increase in demand for psychiatric care in the medium and long term along with an impact on mental health education and research.","Vieta, Eduard; Pérez, Víctor; Arango, Celso",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.004,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
2955,Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical perspectives from a case series,"Abstract Introduction: The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","Valdés-Florido, María José; López-Díaz, Álvaro; Palermo-Zeballos, Fernanda Jazmin; Martínez-Molina, Iván; Martín-Gil, Victoria Eugenia; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Ruiz-Veguilla, Miguel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

2958,Human Influenza Virus Hemagglutinins Contain Conserved Oligomannose N-Linked Glycans Allowing Potent Neutralization by Lectins,"Summary Hemagglutinins (HAs) from human influenza viruses adapt to bind α2-6-linked sialosides, overcoming a receptor-defined species barrier distinct from the α2-3 specificity of avian virus progenitors. Additionally, human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time, although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis, we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast, poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans, which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary, they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally, high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains. These findings reveal the biological significance of HA glycosylation and therapeutic potential of targeting these structures.","Thompson, Andrew J.; Cao, Liwei; Ma, Yuanhui; Wang, Xiaoning; Diedrich, Jolene K.; Kikuchi, Chika; Willis, Shelby; Worth, Charli; McBride, Ryan; Yates, John R.; Paulson, James C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.009,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
2959,Infection and Rapid Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Ferrets,"Summary The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority. We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs. Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.","Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Eun-Ha; Park, Su-Jin; Yu, Kwang-Min; Chang, Jae-Hyung; Kim, Eun Ji; Lee, Seunghun; Casel, Mark Anthony B.; Um, Jihye; Song, Min-Suk; Jeong, Hye Won; Lai, Van Dam; Kim, Yeonjae; Chin, Bum Sik; Park, Jun-Sun; Chung, Ki-Hyun; Foo, Suan-Sin; Poo, Haryoung; Mo, In-Pil; Lee, Ok-Jun; Webby, Richard J.; Jung, Jae U.; Choi, Young Ki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
2960,An Infectious cDNA Clone of SARS-CoV-2,"Summary The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the urgency to develop experimental systems for studying this virus and identifying countermeasures. We report a reverse genetic system for SARS-CoV-2. Seven complimentary DNA (cDNA) fragments spanning the SARS-CoV-2 genome were assembled into a full-genome cDNA. RNA transcribed from the full-genome cDNA was highly infectious after electroporation into cells, producing 2.9 × 106 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL of virus. Compared with a clinical isolate, the infectious-clone-derived SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2) exhibited similar plaque morphology, viral RNA profile, and replication kinetics. Additionally, icSARS-CoV-2 retained engineered molecular markers and did not acquire other mutations. We generated a stable mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) by introducing this reporter gene into ORF7 of the viral genome. icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was successfully used to evaluate the antiviral activities of interferon (IFN). Collectively, the reverse genetic system and reporter virus provide key reagents to study SARS-CoV-2 and develop countermeasures.","Xie, Xuping; Muruato, Antonio; Lokugamage, Kumari G.; Narayanan, Krishna; Zhang, Xianwen; Zou, Jing; Liu, Jianying; Schindewolf, Craig; Bopp, Nathen E.; Aguilar, Patricia V.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Weaver, Scott C.; Makino, Shinji; LeDuc, James W.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Shi, Pei-Yong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.004,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13
2961,Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure,"Summary Proper management of COVID-19 mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis. The sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.","Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J.; Netea, Mihai G.; Rovina, Nikoletta; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Damoraki, Georgia; Gkavogianni, Theologia; Adami, Maria-Evangelia; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Ntaganou, Maria; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Koutsodimitropoulos, Ioannis; Velissaris, Dimitrios; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Karageorgos, Athanassios; Katrini, Konstantina; Lekakis, Vasileios; Lupse, Mihaela; Kotsaki, Antigone; Renieris, George; Theodoulou, Danai; Panou, Vassiliki; Koukaki, Evangelia; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Gogos, Charalambos; Koutsoukou, Antonia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
2962,Next-generation direct-acting influenza therapeutics,"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.","Toots, Mart; Plemper, Richard K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04
2963,Complement associated microvascular injury and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 infection: A report of five cases,"Abstract Acute respiratory failure and a systemic coagulopathy are critical aspects of the morbidity and mortality characterizing infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n=5) and purpuric skin rash (n=3). The pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the inter-alveolar septa by neutrophils. No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic ARDS, were not prominent. These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the alternative and lectin-based complement pathways. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin. In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the inter-alveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of two cases examined. In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state. It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.","Magro, Cynthia; Mulvey, J.

Due to the restrictions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined. Methods We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education. Results We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time. Conclusions These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.","Chick, Robert Connor; Clifton, Guy Travis; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Propper, Brandon W.; Hale, Diane F.; Alseidi, Adnan A.; Vreeland, Timothy J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

This has resulted in the inability to care for patients valvular and structural heart disease (SHD) in a timely fashion potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications including congestive heart failure and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, we suggest guidelines as to how to triage patients in need of SHD interventions and provide a framework of how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, we address the triage of patients in need of trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

2975,The involvement of regulated cell death forms in modulating the bacterial and viral pathogenesis,"Abstract Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis represent three distinct types of regulated cell death forms, which play significant roles in response to viral and bacterial infections. Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host. This chapter discusses the current advances in the research of cell death signaling with regard to viral and bacterial infections and describes the network of the cell death initiating molecular mechanisms that selectively recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns.","Imre, Gergely",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.12.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.12.008,Elsevier,10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.12.008,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27

2981,Dentist manpower development and geographical distribution of dentists in Taiwan,"Abstract Background/purpose The development of dentists in Taiwan has been over a century. This study tried to explore the dentist manpower development and the current status of geographical distribution of dentists in Taiwan. Materials and methods This study used the secondary data analysis to survey the changes of total dentist number from 1986 to 2018 and the geographic distribution of dentists in different levels of dental institutions in 2019. Results The total number of dentists increased from 3739 in 1986 to 14,717 in 2018. The total number of hospital dentists increased from 809 in 1986 to 2121 in 2018. However, the proportion of hospital dentists in the total number of dentists decreased from 21.64% in 1986 to 14.41% in 2018. On the contrary, the total number of dental clinic dentists increased from 2930 in 1986 to 12,596 in 2018. The proportion of dental clinic dentists in the total number of dentists increased from 78.36% in 1986 to 85.59% in 2018. The northern region of Taiwan and Taipei City had 52.81% (7829/14,825) and 22.29% (3304/14,825) of the total number of dentists in 2019, respectively. Hospital dentists showed a significantly greater imbalance in geographic distribution than overall dentists. Conclusion Our results indicate that Taiwan has the problems of oversupply of dentists and imbalance in geographical distribution of dentists. Because continuation of the current dentist manpower development may accelerate the oversupply and geographical imbalance of dentists, a mechanism for controlling the total dentist manpower should be implemented to prevent the deterioration of the problems.","Cheng, Feng-Chou; Yu-Fong Chang, Julia; Lin, Tzu-Chiang; Chang, Wen-Chiung; Chang, Yung-Ta; Chiang, Chun-Pin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jds.2020.04.004,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21

2983,Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model,"Abstract The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1,000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable. We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Material and methods The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020. It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an “online” registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact. acquainted with another patient. Results As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of TRS is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.","Sánchez-Álvarez, J.

SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure. The high prevalence of COVID-19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention. Whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alternation of nucleotides and amino acid sequences. We evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software. We also selected seven types of structural proteins.

The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMPα/β1) mediated viral import. Azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base. All the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection.

In the fight against viral infections, high-purity viral stocks are needed for manufacture of safer vaccines. It is also a priority to ensure the viral safety of biopharmaceuticals such as blood products. Chromatography techniques are widely implemented at both academic and industrial levels in the purification of viral particles, whole viruses and virus-like particles, and to remove viral contaminants from biopharmaceutical products. This paper focuses on polysaccharide adsorbents, particulate resins and membrane adsorbers, used in virus purification/removal chromatography processes. Different chromatographic modes are surveyed, with particular attention on ion exchange and affinity/pseudo-affinity adsorbents among which commercially available agarose-based resins (Sepharose®) and cellulose-based membrane adsorbers (Sartobind®) occupy a dominant position. Mainly built on the development of new ligands coupled to conventional agarose/cellulose matrices, the development perspectives of polysaccharide-based chromatography media in this antiviral area are stressed in a conclusive part.","Junter, Guy-Alain; Lebrun, Laurent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,13/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-13

The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.","ul Qamar, Muhammad Tahir; Alqahtani, Safar M.; Alamri, Mubarak A.; Chen, Ling-Ling",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26

Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid.

2998,"Structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins: Computational methods reveal potential drug candidates against main protease, Nsp12 polymerase and Nsp13 helicase","Abstract The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and instigated a widespread fear, threatening global health security. To date, no licensed antiviral drugs or vaccines are available against COVID-19 although several clinical trials are underway to test possible therapies. During this urgency situation, computational drug discovery methods provide an alternative to tiresome high-throughput screening, particularly in the hit-to-lead-optimization stage. Identification of small molecules that specifically target viral replication apparatus has indicated highest potential towards antiviral drug discovery. In this work, we present potential compounds that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 vital proteins, including the main protease, Nsp12 RNA polymerase and Nsp13 helicase. An integrative virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations approach led to the identification of potential binding modes and favourable molecular interaction profile of corresponding compounds. Moreover, the identification of structurally important binding site residues in conserved motifs located inside the active site highlights relative importance of ligand binding based on residual energy decomposition analysis. Although the current study lacks experimental validation, the structural information obtained from this computational study has paved way for the design of targeted inhibitors to combat COVID-19 outbreak.","Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Froeyen, Matheus",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.04.008,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

However, currently, drugs specifically approved for clinical use are not available, except for vaccines against COVID-19 that are being evaluated. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is capable of performing syndrome differentiation and treatment according to the clinical manifestations of patients, and has a better ability of epidemic prevention and control. The authors comprehensively analyzed the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on the theory of TCM, and discussed its syndrome differentiation, treatment and prevention measures so as to provide strategies and reference for the prevention and treatment with TCM.","Wang, Shi-xin; Wang, Yan; Lu, Yu-bao; Li, Jie-yun; Song, Yu-jun; Nyamgerelt, Munkhtuya; Wang, Xue-xi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.joim.2020.04.001,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
3001,Positive SARS-Cov-2 test in a woman with COVID-19 at 22 days after hospital discharge: A case report,"Abstract Background In a few discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the nucleic acid test shows positive results again. Whether this is due to relapse of the disease, reinfection by the virus, or a false-positive result at hospital discharge is worth exploring. Case presentation A woman with COVID-19 was discharged from the hospital after integrative treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine because she met the discharge standards. However, she obtained positive results on a nucleic acid test 22 days later. Conclusion Based on this positive test result in a discharged patient with COVID-19, anal tests and coronavirus antibody tests should be combined with throat swab tests to further develop the diagnosis and discharge standards for patients with COVID-19.","Luo, Anming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jtcms.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
3002,Importance of Viral Disease in Dairy Cow Fertility,"Abstract Many viral diseases are endemic in cattle populations worldwide. The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","Wathes, D.

3003,Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COS-COVID),"Abstract Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated.","Jin, Xinyao; Pang, Bo; Zhang, Junhua; Liu, Qingquan; Yang, Zhongqi; Feng, Jihong; Liu, Xuezheng; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Baohe; Huang, Yuhong; Josephine Fauci, Alice; Ma, Yuling; Soo Lee, Myeong; Yuan, Wei'an; Xie, Yanming; Tang, Jianyuan; Gao, Rui; Du, Liang; Zhang, Shuo; Qi, Hanmei; Sun, Yu; Zheng, Wenke; Yang, Fengwen; Chua, Huizi; Wang, Keyi; Ou, Yi; Huang, Ming; Zhu, Yan; Yu, Jiajie; Tian, Jinhui; Zhao, Min; Hu, Jingqing; Yao, Chen; Li, Youping; Zhang, Boli",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

3005,Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study,"Abstract An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in China since December 2019. More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%–2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2–14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1–14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5–9) d versus 11 (8–13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cai, Qingxian; Yang, Minghui; Liu, Dongjing; Chen, Jun; Shu, Dan; Xia, Junxia; Liao, Xuejiao; Gu, Yuanbo; Cai, Qiue; Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Xiaohe; Peng, Ling; Huang, Deliang; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Shurong; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Jiaye; Chen, Li; Chen, Shuyan; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhang, Zheng; Cao, Ruiyuan; Zhong, Wu; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

3011,Expert recommendations on blood purification treatment protocol for patients with severe COVID-19 Recommendation and consensus,"Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019. The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.","Yang, Xiang-Hong; Sun, Ren-Hua; Zhao, Ming-Yan; Chen, Er-Zhen; Liu, Jiao; Wang, Hong-Liang; Yang, Rong-Li; Chen, De-Chang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.04.002,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of 48 consecutive patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients), secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) (8 patients), or relapsed disease with CNS involvement (13 patients) from July 2006 to December 2017. Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). Results The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for patients with PCNSL in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%), respectively. On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P = .007 for PFS; P = .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively. The most common side effects were febrile neutropenia (89.6%; of which 66.7% had an infectious etiology identified), nausea/vomiting (85.4%), diarrhea (93.8%), mucositis (89.6%), and electrolyte abnormalities (89.6%). Four patients (8.3%) died of treatment-related overwhelming infection; of these patients, 3 had SCNSL.

Design A descriptive and observational study was carried out between September 2010 and September 2017. Setting Pediatric intensive care unit. Patients Infants under one year of age with severe bronchiolitis. Interventions Two periods were compared (2010–14 and 2015–17), corresponding to before and after modification of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis in hospital. Main variables Patient sex, age, comorbidities, severity, etiology, administered treatment, bacterial infections, respiratory and inotropic support, length of stay and mortality. Results A total of 706 patients were enrolled, of which 414 (58.6%) males, with a median age of 47 days (IQR 25–100.25). Median bronchiolitis severity score (BROSJOD) upon admission: 9 points (IQR 7–11). Respiratory syncytial virus appeared in 460 (65.16%) patients. The first period (2010–14) included 340 patients and the second period (2015–17) 366 patients. More adrenalin and hypertonic saline nebulizations and more corticosteroid treatment were administered in the second period. More noninvasive ventilation and less conventional mechanical ventilation were used, and less inotropic support was needed, with no significant differences.

The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible etiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children.","Molero-Senosiain, M.; Domingo-Gordo, B.; Fernández Cabrera, C.; Hernández-García, E.; Gómez de Liaño, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oftale.2020.01.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oftale.2020.01.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.oftale.2020.01.012,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.A.; Gómez-Pinedo, U.; Matías-Guiu, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
3021,Should we expect neurological symptoms in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic?,"Abstract Introduction There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.03.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
3022,Management of neurological care during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care. This article addresses operational decision-making during the epidemic. Development We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures. Conclusion Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation. Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated.","Matías-Guiu, J.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Lopez-Valdes, E.; Garcia-Morales, I.; Guerrero-Solá, A.; Matias-Guiu, J.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrleng.2020.04.001,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
3023,A case of COVID-19 patient with the diarrhea as initial symptom and literature review,"Summary Since Dec 2019, a cluster of pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and soon spread to all province of China. The pathogen was proved to be a novel betacoronavirus called 2019 novel coronavirus (officially named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19). The typical clinical manifestations were fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia or fatigue. Less common symptoms included headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. However diarrhea as the first symptom is rarely reported. Here we reported a case of 2019 novel coronavirus-infected patient (NCIP) with diarrhea as the initial symptom. Image of CT scan and laboratory examination and careful collected as well as detection of viral RNA in pharynx. The case demonstrate that gastrointestinal symptoms ware not rare in NCIP, and diarrhea could be the initial symptom.","Yang, Xiaodong; Zhao, Jie; Yan, Qiang; Zhang, Shangxin; Wang, Yigao; Li, Yongxiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clinre.2020.03.013,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

For the purpose, we developed a molecular docking based webserver, namely D3Targets-2019-nCoV, with two functions, one is for predicting drug targets for drugs or active compounds observed from clinic or in vitro/in vivo studies, the other is for identifying lead compounds against potential drug targets via docking. This server has its unique features, (1) the potential target proteins and their different conformations involving in the whole process from virus infection to replication and release were included as many as possible; (2) all the potential ligand-binding sites with volume larger than 200 Å3 on a protein structure were identified for docking; (3) correlation information among some conformations or binding sites was annotated; (4) it is easily to be updated, and is accessible freely to public (https://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/index.php). Currently, the webserver contains 42 proteins [20 severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encoded proteins and 22 human proteins involved in virus infection, replication and release] with 69 different conformations/structures and 557 potential ligand-binding pockets in total. With 6 examples, we demonstrated that the webserver should be useful to medicinal chemists, pharmacologists and clinicians for efficiently discovering or developing effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 to cure COVID-19.","Shi, Yulong; Zhang, Xinben; Mu, Kaijie; Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Zhengdan; Wang, Xiaoyu; Yang, Yanqing; Xu, Zhijian; Zhu, Weiliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.006,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20
3035,Potential therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in the severely ill patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hypertension, and multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antivirals with safe clinical profile are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. In an analysis of a randomly collected cohort of 124 patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), we found that hypercoagulability as indicated by elevated concentrations of D-dimers was associated with disease severity. By virtual screening of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, we identified an anticoagulation agent dipyridamole (DIP) in silico, which suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In a proof-of-concept trial involving 31 patients with COVID-19, DIP supplementation was associated with significantly decreased concentrations of D-dimers (P<0.05), increased lymphocyte and platelet recovery in the circulation, and markedly improved clinical outcomes in comparison to the control patients. In particular, all 8 of the DIP-treated severely ill patients showed remarkable improvement: 7 patients (87.5%) achieved clinical cure and were discharged from the hospitals while the remaining 1 patient (12.5%) was in clinical remission.","Liu, Xiaoyan; Li, Zhe; Liu, Shuai; Sun, Jing; Chen, Zhanghua; Jiang, Min; Zhang, Qingling; Wei, Yinghua; Wang, Xin; Huang, Yi-You; Shi, Yinyi; Xu, Yanhui; Xian, Huifang; Bai, Fan; Ou, Changxing; Xiong, Bei; Lew, Andrew M.; Cui, Jun; Fang, Rongli; Huang, Hui; Zhao, Jincun; Hong, Xuechuan; Zhang, Yuxia; Zhou, Fuling; Luo, Hai-Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apsb.2020.04.008,20/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-20

However, some concerns regarding the viability of smart technology applications must be addressed. This study investigated these concerns by reviewing the current practices of smart technology applications to mobile health care. As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively.

India's reforms have been sporadic and are still a work in progress. The record-breaking expansion of China's financial system in fostering investments was overlooked, but has attracted considerable attention in recent years.

Cancer patients are already known to be very fragile and COVID-19 brings about the risk of severe respiratory complications. In order to treat patients safely while protecting medical teams, the entire health care system must optimize the way it approaches prevention and treatment at a time when social distancing is key to stemming this pandemic. All indications and treatment modalities must be re-discussed. This is particularly the case for radiotherapy of bone metastases for which it is possible to reduce the number of sessions, the frequency of transport and the complexity of treatments. These changes will have to be discussed according to the organization of each radiotherapy department and the health situation, while medical teams must remain vigilant about the risks of complications of bone metastases, particularly spinal metastases. In this short piece, the members of the GEMO (the European Study Group of Bone Metastases) offer a number of recommendations to achieve the above objectives, both in general and in relation to five of the most common situations on radiation therapy for bone metastases.","Thureau, Sébastien; Faivre, Jean Christophe; Assaker, Richard; Biver, Emmanuel; Confavreux, Cyrille B.; Debiais, Françoise; Duterque-Coquillaud, Martine; Giammarile, Fransesco; Heymann, Dominique; Lecouvet, Frédéric E.; Morardet, Laetitia; Paycha, Frederic; Body, Jean-Jacques; Vieillard, Marie-Hélène",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100291,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100291,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100291,13/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-13

3052,Leveraging a Bayesian Network approach to model and analyze supplier vulnerability to severe weather risk: A case study of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria,"Abstract The United States government has identified the health care sector as part of the critical infrastructure for homeland security to protect citizens against health risks arising from terrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics. Citizens also have expectations about the role that health care plays in enjoying a good quality of life, by providing response systems to handle emergencies and other illness situations adequately. Among the systems required to support desired performance levels is a robust and resilient pharmaceutical supply chain that is free of disruption. Shortages of drugs place undue pressure on healthcare providers to devise alternative approaches to administer patient care. With climate change expected to result in increasingly severe weather patterns in the future, it is critical that logistics engineers understand the impact that a catastrophic weather event could have on supply chain disruption to facilitate the design of supply systems that are robust and resilient. This study investigates the main causal and intermediate events that led to risk propagation in, and disruption of, the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain following Hurricane Maria. A causality Bayesian model is developed to depict linkages between risk events and quantify the associated cumulative risk. The quantification is further examined through different advanced techniques such as predictive inference reasoning and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses suggests that port resilience is imperative to pharmaceutical supply chain performance in the case of Puerto Rico.","Lawrence, Jeanne-Marie; Ibne Hossain, Niamat Ullah; Jaradat, Raed; Hamilton, Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101607,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101607,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101607,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

3055,"Inhibitory effects of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide on coronavirus HCoV-229E replication and cytokine production by primary cultures of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells","Abstract Background Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), one of the causes of the common cold, exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. Methods Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. Results Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2′2′-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Watanabe, Oshi; Nomura, Kazuhiro; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Momma, Haruki; Ichinose, Masakazu; Kawase, Tetsuaki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,21/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-21
3056,COVID-19 outbreak: an elusive enemy,"Abstract A novel coronavirus, officially termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019. Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care. Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic. A novel coronavirus — officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 by the authorities — emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019 [1, 2]. Just four months later, more than 100,000 cases have been diagnosed with the resulting disease, COVID-19, in more than 100 countries at the time of writing this paper [3]. Not only does mainland China have the most number of reported cases (94.4%), but its case-fatality rate is also relatively higher than that of other countries as of February 28, 2020 (China: 3.5%, 2,791 deaths among 78,961 confirmed cases; other countries: 1.4%, 67 deaths among 4,691 confirmed cases) [4]. In an attempt to restrict the outbreak, China quickly implemented an unprecedented measure of quarantining 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities, but its impact on slowing the global spread of the virus now seems inadequate. In fact, the number of cases in local human-to-human transmission kept soaring in several countries as of March 25, 2020: Italy 63,927 cases, United States of America 42,164 cases, and Spain 33,089 cases [3]. In Japan, 1,128 cases were confirmed based on positive viral nucleic acid test results, and the overall case-fatality rate was 3.7% (i.e., 42 deaths) [3].","Kikuchi, Toshiaki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resinv.2020.03.006,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

3063,Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist,"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.","Bansal, Priya; Bingemann, Theresa A.; Greenhawt, Matthew; Mosnaim, Giselle; Nanda, Anil; Oppenheimer, John; Sharma, Hemant; Stukus, David; Shaker, Marcus",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
3064,Special Article: Risk Communication During COVID-19,"Abstract: During the unprecedented times caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19, there is rapidly evolving information and guidance. However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication. This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is utilizing social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging. As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.","Abrams, Elissa M.; Greenhawt, Matthew",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.012,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

3072,Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases,"Summary WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","Ramanathan, Kollengode; Antognini, David; Combes, Alain; Paden, Matthew; Zakhary, Bishoy; Ogino, Mark; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel; Shekar, Kiran",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,Elsevier,10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

3100,The COVID-19 pandemic: implications for the cytology laboratory,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites. The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures. Because of repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, health care and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19. This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens. It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees, and pathologists. In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pambuccian, Stefan E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26

3103,Chemical engineering and environmental challenges. Cyclic adsorption/reaction technologies: Materials and process together!,"Abstract I start with a brief survey of paradigms in Chemical Engineering to highlight that in the early 70 s my thesis advisor P. Le Goff already mentioned the strong link of chemical processes with Environment, Energy and Economy (Market). Then I move to my vision of ChE today summarized in ChE = M2P2E (Molecular, Materials, Process and Product Engineering). I describe how I built a research lab centered around Cyclic Adsorption/Reaction Processes focusing in adsorption technologies to help solving environmental problems. I stress the basic concepts of adsorption processes and the need to use proper diffusion models for intraparticle mass transfer instead of pseudo first order or second order kinetic models. I also consider that adsorbent metrics should be linked to the process where the material is used: materials and processes together! In the last section I review some challenging areas where adsorption technologies are useful. Carbon Capture and Utilization involving Pressure Swing Adsorption to capture CO2 from flue gas in a pilot plant, 3D printed composite monoliths for Electric Swing Adsorption, and Utilization of CO2 to be transformed in methanol or Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) (Power-to-Gas concept). I also address the general topic “Processing of diluted aqueous solutions” with special attention for the development of Simulated Moving Bed coupled with Expanded Bed Adsorption. Finally the integrated process to produce high-added valued compounds (vanillin and syringaldehyde) from Kraft lignin is shown as an example of Lignin valorization in pulp mill biorefinery.","Rodrigues, Alírio E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31
3104,"Epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of respiratory viruses from 2012 to 2015 – A sentinel surveillance report from union territory of Puducherry, India","Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30–70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. Methods As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. Results During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. Conclusion Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","Palani, Nandhini; Sistla, Sujatha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.04.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cegh.2020.04.019,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

3106,Herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19: a rapid review of guidelines,"Abstract Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and has caused illness to many people worldwide. This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. Results: Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines. In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage. In the frequency analysis of herbs, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found to be the herb with the highest frequency of usage in the Chinese guidelines. Conclusion: This review can be used as guidance for the traditional medicine treatment of COVID-19. Clinical evidence is needed in the future to evaluate the efficacy of traditional medicine.","Ang, Lin; Lee, Hye Won; Choi, Jun Yong; Zhang, Junhua; Soo Lee, Myeong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,Elsevier,10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3112,Chinese herbal Huo-Gu formula for the treatment of steroid-associated osteonecrosis of femoral head: A 14-year follow-up of convalescent SARS patients,"Summary Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants and methods A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan–Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

3123,The experiences of health-care providers during the COVID-19 crisis in China: a qualitative study,"Summary Background In the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed. Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak. Methods We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Findings We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was “being fully responsible for patients' wellbeing—‘this is my duty’”. Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was “challenges of working on COVID-19 wards”. Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was “resilience amid challenges”. Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience. Interpretation The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.

3131,"Confronting, collaborating, withdrawing? A psychiatric evaluation of three strategies to promote political climate action","ABSTRACT This qualitative study analyzes the lack of political action to address climate change using a psychiatric lens, and frames that ambivalence lies at the core of inaction. While most politicians understand that climate action is absolutely necessary, any significant action is stalled by a number of important barriers they have to overcome. Using clinical analogies from eating disorders and the scientific literature on motivational change, this paper analyses three current strategies that push for political action. First, using force and emotions (like confronting activists) is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing politicians' resistance to change. Second, collaborative discussions in multilateral conferences and debates risk feeding verbal manifestos without enacting behavioural change. Withdrawal from the manifestos of politicians is a third strategy to push for change discussed in this paper. However, even after bypassing manifestos, this strategy is unlikely to succeed because the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions, linked to our current social norms, seriously outweigh the benefits of climate action. Overall, all three methods present severe flaws and are not viable solutions to help politicians implement climate action. Other enhanced options are likely to be necessary.","BARBALAT, Dr. Guillaume",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101547,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101547,Elsevier,10.1016/j.erss.2020.101547,11/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-11

3133,Internet-based self-help intervention aimed at increasing social self-efficacy among internal migrants in Poland: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Abstract Background Migration is a challenging life transition that may be a source of various problems related to well-being and mental health. However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy—the beliefs in one's ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. Methods The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of N = 280 participants aged at least 18 years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6 months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. Discussion The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland. Trial registration The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04088487) on 11th September 2019.","Rogala, Anna; Szczepaniak, Maria; Michalak, Natalia; Andersson, Gerhard",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100322,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100322,Elsevier,10.1016/j.invent.2020.100322,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

3135,Entrepreneurship in a Transformative and Resource-Rich State: The Case of Qatar,"Abstract Countries blessed with natural resources have generally struggled to achieve sustainable economic development and prosperity. Population growth, the depletion of natural resources coupled with mismanagement, and sharp fluctuations in prices of those resources are among the main reasons for sub-optimal economic performance. Some resource-rich countries have been expending effort and money in an attempt to change this inverse relationship (a.k.a. “the resource curse”) by designing policies to diversify their economies with high value-added industries and sectors. Qatar is a such country and point of the interest in this article. Qatar's political and economic structure, its efforts to diversify its economy, and the potential for improved entrepreneurial outcomes with high value-added products, services, businesses, and industries are analyzed. The country has been very effective in maximizing the benefits of its oil resources and especially its large natural gas reserves, becoming the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world. Revenues from oil and gas sales have been invested in the domestic economy and global assets. Thus far, however, it has not shown the in-house capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship critical for sustainable economic diversification going forward.

3137,Socially distanced school-based nutrition program feeding under COVID 19 in the rural Niger Delta,"Abstract The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is widely recognized as a complex and contentious space for oil exploration and production. Over the past few decades, the Niger Delta has witnessed large-scale mass peaceful mobilizations and rebellion-like conditions from violent militia groups. Oil companies have been implicated in violence perpetrated by Nigerian security forces. Local host communities have suffered greatly from corruption, political instability, violence and the environmental devastation of their farmlands and fishing grounds. Oil companies have increasingly turned to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to attempt to build or repair relations with oil-producing communities. There are also governmental and non-governmental humanitarian actors supporting various initiatives in the oil-producing areas. This article highlights the challenges that one long running micro-scale development project has faced due to the COVID 19 disease outbreak and the closure of all schools in Rivers State, Nigeria in March 2020. The school closures have halted some initiatives, but our weekly nutritional program feedings have continued in new, socially distanced forms.","Francis, Nabie Nubari; Pegg, Scott",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.007,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
3138,Consistently Unreliable: Oil Spill Data and Transparency Discourse,"Abstract Our recent research reveals enormous discrepancies in oil spill data disclosed by regulatory institutions and corporate sources in Nigeria. Federal agencies as well as major international oil corporations publish inconsistent and sometimes contradictory figures, often employing different spatial or regional categorizations. Uncertainties pertaining to data veracity in the Niger Delta, alongside the thin scientific record inflect deeply contentious debates regarding the country's oil industry. For advocacy organizations, the result is that those seeking to monitor oil spills may spend hours trying to square and cross-reference uneven information, time that could otherwise be spent assessing the scale of impacts and analyzing the complex structural causes surrounding them. Scholarly work in other jurisdictions indicates that the staging of non-transparent, incoherent and/or intentionally misleading data on oil spill risks is not unique to Nigeria, leading to a kind of epistemological vertigo in studying this sector.","Watts, Professor Michael; Zalik, Dr. Anna",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.009,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

3140,Retained copper fragments following removal of a copper intrauterine device: Two case reports,"Abstract Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are safe, cost-effective, and reliable contraceptives, and are gaining popularity worldwide. While complications associated with IUD use are rare, they range from expulsion to uterine perforation. Numerous reports have been published regarding the sequelae of intraperitoneal copper IUDs or retained fragments following the removal of a fractured device. No data exist, however, on the intraperitoneal retention of copper following the removal of an otherwise intact IUD. Here we present two patients in whom copper IUDs were found to have missing fragments of copper wire despite removal of an otherwise intact IUD found in utero. We caution providers to examine all removed devices carefully, to surgically address intraperitoneal copper in order to mitigate adhesion formation, and to counsel patients about this potentially serious complication.","Dubovis, Marina; Rizk, Naglaa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.crwh.2020.e00208,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crwh.2020.e00208,Elsevier,10.1016/j.crwh.2020.e00208,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24
3141,Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for action for mental health science,"Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.

This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2–3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations issued by the World Health Organization.","Palacios Cruz, M.; Santos, E.; Velázquez Cervantes, M.A.; León Juárez, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rceng.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rceng.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rceng.2020.03.001,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
3145,Beware: Gastrointestinal symptoms can be a manifestation of COVID-19,"Abstract Background There is a growing number of reports of COVID-19 cases presenting gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Aims To review studies reporting GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients. Results Fifteen papers (2800 patients) were identified. Frequency of GI symptoms varied from 3.0% to 39.6%, including diarrhea: 7.5%, nausea: 4.5%, anorexia: 4.4%, vomiting: 1.3%, abdominal pain: 0.5%, belching/reflux: 0.3%. These may be the first manifestation of COVID-19, however, there is controversy whether these reflect better or worst prognosis. Finally, the potential relationship with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor in the digestive tract as the virus entry route, is discussed. Conclusions GI symptoms may be common in COVID-19 may be the first manifestation before fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, clinicians and gastroenterologists need to be aware of these atypical cases during the current pandemic and of the fecal–oral transmission, and preventive measures may be implemented.","Schmulson, M.; Dávalos, F.; Berumen, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rgmxen.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rgmxen.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rgmxen.2020.04.001,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

We analyzed data obtained from physical market survey data for 2,782 individuals from 27 species, with 2,420 individuals reported in early surveys (1968-1988) and 362 individuals reported in later surveys (2003-2015) and online surveys (February 2017 to January 2019). We compared information on asking prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and Internet era). In comparison with the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing physical bird markets and online markets. In all data sets, biological factors such as wingspan were significant factors in explaining price variation. We conclude that sustained monitoring is needed to make direct comparisons between the trade platforms. With a continued increase of wildlife trade on online platforms, we recommend increased regulation and enforcement of wildlife trade laws.","Siriwat, Penthai; Nijman, Vincent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

3154,China's online parrot trade: Generation length and body mass determine sales volume via price,"Abstract The wildlife trade threatens global biodiversity and animal welfare, where parrots are among the taxa most frequently traded, supplying exotic pets and captive breeders worldwide. Using phylogenetic path analysis, we examine how biological factors interact with price to influence online protected parrot trade volumes in China, using transactions recorded for 46 species (n = 5,862 individuals). Trade was greatest in smaller, faster breeding species that commanded a lower price. This price effect followed the economic law of demand, with Relatively Inelastic Demand (−0.758), outweighing indicators of ‘quality’ such as body coloration, and conservation status. We identify two areas of concern: those larger, slower-breeding, rarer species, even though sold at lower numbers, may be at conservation risk if harvested from the wild. In contrast, the sheer numbers (over 90% of the individuals were under median generation length, body mass and/or price) and ready availability of smaller and more common species comprises a substantial overall animal welfare issue, given that the capture, importation, or captive breeding of many parrot species in China is illegal and thus unregulated. Our investigation highlights the importance of properly understanding the internal relations among drivers of wildlife trade to inform appropriate management.","Yin, Ru-Yi; Ye, Yun-Chun; Newman, Chris; Buesching, Christina D.; Macdonald, David W.; Luo, Yi; Zhou, Zhao-Min",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01047,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

3173,Chaos game representation dataset of SARS-CoV-2 genome,"Abstract As of April 16, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (called COVID-19) spread to more than 185 countries/regions with more than 142,000 deaths and more than 2,000,000 confirmed cases. In the bioinformatics area, one of the crucial points is the analysis of the virus nucleotide sequences using approaches such as data stream, digital signal processing, and machine learning techniques and algorithms. However, to make feasible this approach, it is necessary to transform the nucleotide sequences string to numerical values representation. Thus, the dataset provides a chaos game representation (CGR) of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleotide sequences. The dataset provides the CGR of 100 instances of SARS-CoV-2 virus, 11540 instances of other viruses from the Virus-Host DB dataset, and three instances of Riboviria viruses from NCBI (Betacoronavirus RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).","Barbosa, Raquel de M.; Fernandes, Marcelo A.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105618,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105618,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dib.2020.105618,25/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-25
3174,The Data set for Patient Information Based Algorithm to Predict Mortality Cause by COVID-19,"Abstract The data of COVID-19 disease in China and then in South Korea were collected daily from several different official websites. The collected data included 33 death cases in Wuhan city of Hubei province during early outbreak as well as confirmed cases and death toll in some specific regions, which were chosen as representatives from the perspective of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Data were copied and pasted onto Excel spreadsheets to perform data analysis. A new methodology, Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA) [1], has been adapted to process the data and used to estimate the death rate of COVID-19 in real-time. Assumption is that the number of days from inpatients to death fall into a pattern of normal distribution and the scores in normal distribution can be obtained by observing 33 death cases and analysing the data [2]. We selected 5 scores in normal distribution of these durations as lagging days, which will be used in the following estimation of death rate. We calculated each death rate on accumulative confirmed cases with each lagging day from the current data and then weighted every death rate with its corresponding possibility to obtain the total death rate on each day. While the trendline of these death rate curves meet the curve of current ratio between accumulative death cases and confirmed cases at some points in the near future, we considered that these intersections are within the range of real death rates. Six tables were presented to illustrate the PIBA method using data from China and South Korea.

3175,Establishing Telemedicine in an Academic Total Joint Arthroplasty Practice: Needs and Opportunities Highlighted by the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted rapid restructuring of the healthcare system in an effort to stop the spread of the virus and to treat patients who are acutely ill with COVID-19, while continuing to provide outpatient care for the remainder of patients. To help control spread of this pandemic, many centers have boosted telemedicine capability to care for patients who would typically be seen in person in outpatient settings, including total joint arthroplasty clinics. We review key components relevant to the establishment and effective use of telemedicine, focused on patient education, practice logistics, technological considerations, and sensitive patient health information–associated compliance factors, which are necessary to provide care remotely for total joint arthroplasty patients.","Rao, Sandesh S.; Loeb, Alexander E.; Amin, Raj M.; Golladay, Gregory J.; Levin, Adam S.; Thakkar, Savyasachi C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.artd.2020.04.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artd.2020.04.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.artd.2020.04.014,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23
3176,How virus size and attachment parameters affect the temperature sensitivity of virus binding to host cells: Predictions of a thermodynamic model for arboviruses and HIV,"Abstract Virus binding to host cells involves specific interactions between viral (glyco)proteins (GP) and host cell surface receptors (Cr) (protein or sialic acid (SA)). The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (ΔCp = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (ΔCp = −5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of ΔCp from 0 to ~−2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of ΔCp of ~−3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20 °C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of ΔCp greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ~20 °C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from ΔCp ~ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of ΔCp as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37 °C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (ΔSa_immob) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. ΔSa_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. ΔSa_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative ΔSa_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0 °C to 40 °C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative ΔSa_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for ΔSa_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37 °C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making ΔSa_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37 °C.","Gale, Paul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12
3177,Microneedle array delivered recombinant coronavirus vaccines: Immunogenicity and rapid translational development,"Abstract Background Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, Eun; Erdos, Geza; Huang, Shaohua; Kenniston, Thomas W.; Balmert, Stephen C.; Carey, Cara Donahue; Raj, V.

3178,Longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,"Abstract Background The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear. Methods Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0•6 (0•6-0•8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4•7 (3•6-5•8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0•8-1•4); 2•0 (1•5-2•9)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0•93) and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0•94) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Interpretation The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R and NLR may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.

3179,Impact of immune enhancement on Covid-19 polyclonal hyperimmune globulin therapy and vaccine development,"Abstract The pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus – SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a cause of acute respiratory illness, named Covid-19, is placing the healthcare systems of many countries under unprecedented stress. Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle – the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis.","de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Chen, Shiwei; Gan, Esther S.; Ooi, Eng Eong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102768,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102768,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102768,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

3183,School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,"Summary In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Policy makers need to be aware of the equivocal evidence when considering school closures for COVID-19, and that combinations of social distancing measures should be considered. Other less disruptive social distancing interventions in schools require further consideration if restrictive social distancing policies are implemented for long periods.","Viner, Russell M; Russell, Simon J; Croker, Helen; Packer, Jessica; Ward, Joseph; Stansfield, Claire; Mytton, Oliver; Bonell, Chris; Booy, Robert",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2352-4642(20)30095-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2352-4642(20)30095-x,Elsevier,10.1016/s2352-4642(20)30095-x,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

3196,The practical need to challenge the status quo: New directions in bioethics,"Abstract Those of us working in bioethics field take it for granted that the rest of the world reads our work and uses it as part of their scholarship and reasoning processes. Having widespread national and international influence is true for some of the biggest name bioethicists, but interactions at new international conferences or browsing through publications often brings revealing – and potentially humbling – news about how little effect our research tends to have on what is going on elsewhere. We are unrecognized outside of our small, tightly bound professional groups, and our ideas fail to be incorporated freely throughout outsiders’ scholarly work. Putting our professional hurt feelings aside, we should have far greater concerns of possibly unneeded effort and hampered progress in the field based on unintentional ignorance of how other geographic regions are doing their bioethics. It makes no practical sense for efforts to be duplicated, especially if someone else has done it better, or at least, earlier. More wasteful is exploring already well-examined ground, and then previously found not worth any further resources. At the very least, needless research is a lost opportunity to make bioethics better.","Cooley, Dennis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

3200,Commentaire sur un article d'Alberto Quintavalla & Klaus Heine. Reconnaître l'importance du droit à la santé comme condition préalable à la hiérarchisation des droits,"Résumé Ce commentaire, qui porte sur l'article de Heine et Quintavalla intitulé ""Priorités et droits de l'homme"", examine la position des auteurs selon laquelle, si le droit à la vie et les autres droits civils et politiques sont aussi importants que la santé et les autres droits sociaux, il est nécessaire de hiérarchiser les types de droits dans une certaine mesure, car tous les droits ne peuvent être mis en œuvre simultanément. Ce commentaire rejoint la contestation par Heine et Quintavalla de l'argument commun selon lequel les droits civils et politiques sont d'une importance supérieure [1-3]. Mais ce commentaire va plus loin, en suggérant qu'avant qu'une société ne commence à donner la priorité à la mise en œuvre des droits de l'homme, elle doit d'abord s'assurer que le droit à la santé est effectivement aussi important que les droits civils et politiques. Ce commentaire utilise l'exemple des tribunaux nationaux pour montrer comment l'engagement judiciaire en faveur du droit à la santé a commencé à effacer la frontière entre les catégories de droits. Il suggère qu'une plus grande interconnexion entre le droit à la santé et les autres droits a également rendu beaucoup plus difficile l'établissement d'une relation hiérarchique. Ainsi, avant que la mise en œuvre puisse avoir un ordre défini, les États doivent d'abord parvenir à une compréhension commune de l'importance égale, voire supérieure, du droit à la santé. Abstract This commentary, on Heine and Quintavalla’s article Priorities and Human Rights, considers the authors’ position that, while the right to life and other civil and political rights are equally as important as health and other social rights, some degree of prioritizing types of rights is necessary because all rights cannot be implemented simultaneously. This commentary concurs with Heine and Quintavalla’s challenge to the common argument that civil and political rights are of higher importance [1-3]. But this commentary goes further, in suggesting that before a society begins to prioritize implementation of human rights, it must first secure the basic understanding that the right to health is indeed equally important to civil and political rights. This commentary uses the example of national courts to show how judicial engagement with the right to health has begun to chip away at the boundary between the categories of rights. It suggests that greater interconnection among health and other rights has also made mapping out a hierarchical relationship far more difficult. Thus, before implementation can have any defined order, states must first come to a shared understanding regarding the equal if not greater importance of the right to health.","Uberoi, Diya; Forman, Lisa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100516,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100516,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100516,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29
3201,SARS-Cov-2 in Spanish Intensive Care: Early Experience with 15-day Survival In Vitoria,"Abstract Purpose: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Spain in February 2020, with 216% intensive care unit (ICU) capacity expanded in Vitoria by March 18th, 2020. Methods: We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in March 31th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 7-days of ICU stay. Results: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (n = 48%), arterial hypertension (n = 44%) and chronic lung disease (n = 37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 HFNT, 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (49%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented co-infection. Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 µg/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days. Conclusion: This early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.","Barrasa, Helena; Rello, Jordi; Tejada, Sofia; Martín, Alejandro; Balziskueta, Goiatz; Vinuesa, Cristina; Fernández-Miret, Borja; Villagra, Ana; Vallejo, Ana; Sebastián, Ana San; Cabañes, Sara; Iribarren, Sebastián; Fonseca, Fernando; Maynar, Javier",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.accpm.2020.04.001,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

3210,Experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19 in radiology department,"Abstract In December 2019, a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology were discovered in Wuhan city, China. Laboratory examination identified a novel coronavirus which was tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The WHO has more recently formally named the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). Within one month, the novel coronavirus rapidly spread across the whole of China through droplet transmission and contact transmission, and the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated a rising trend. Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography CT, were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of infected cases. Reports stated that many radiologists and technologists were being infected when examining patients with COVID-19. In order to clarify the imaging features of COVID-19 and reduce the infection risk of medical personnel in radiology departments, we summarized the experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19, aiming to guide virus prevention, diagnosis and control within radiology departments.","Ding, Jinli; Liu, Yaou; Fu, Haihong; Gao, Jianbo; Zhao, Xin; Zheng, Junhui; Sun, Wenge; Ma, Xinwu; Feng, Ji; Liang, Pan; Wu, Aiqin; Liu, Jie; Wang, Yun; Geng, Pengfei; Chen, Yong; Li, Hongjun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count. While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited. The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low. There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination. This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.","Chen, Haixia; Ai, Li; Lu, Hong; Li, Hongjun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.003,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
3213,Quantitative computed tomography of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia,"Abstract Objective To quantify coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and to explore whether quantitative computer tomography (CT) could be used to assess severity on admission. Materials and methods From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = −0.42, −0.53, −0.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P = 0.0994; rs = 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P = 0.0903, 0.0989). Conclusions Quantitative CT may have potential in assessing the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.","Cheng, Zenghui; Qin, Le; Cao, Qiqi; Dai, Jianyi; Pan, Ashan; Yang, Wenjie; Gao, Yaozong; Chen, Lei; Yan, Fuhua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jrid.2020.04.004,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
3214,Management guidelines for pregnant healthcare workers exposed to infectious dermatoses,"Abstract Exanthematous diseases are frequently of infectious origin, posing risks, especially for pregnant healthcare workers (HCWs) who treat them. The shift from cell-mediated (Th1 cytokine profile) to humoral (Th2 cytokine profile) immunity during pregnancy can influence the mother’s susceptibility to infection and lead to complications for both mother and fetus. The potential for vertical transmission must be considered when evaluating the risks for pregnant HCWs treating infected patients, as fetal infection can often have devastating consequences. Given the high proportion of women of childbearing age among HCWs, the pregnancy-related risks of infectious exposure are an important topic in both patient care and occupational health. Contagious patients with cutaneous manifestations often present to dermatology or pediatric clinics, where female providers are particularly prevalent, as a growing number of these physicians are female. Unfortunately, the risks of infection for pregnant HCWs are not well defined. To our knowledge, there is limited guidance on safe practices for pregnant HCWs who encounter infectious dermatologic diseases. In this article, we review several infectious exanthems, their transmissibility to pregnant women, the likelihood of vertical transmission, and the potential consequences of infection for the mother and the fetus. Additionally, we discuss recommendations with respect to avoidance, contact and respiratory precautions, and the need for treatment following exposure.","Reddy, Vidhatha; Kollhoff, Alexander L; Murase, Jenny E; Martires, Kathryn",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijwd.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijwd.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijwd.2020.04.004,18/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-18

3217,Startups in times of crisis – A rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Research summary The discovery of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the spread of COVID-19 have led many governments to take drastic measures. The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.","Kuckertz, Andreas; Brändle, Leif; Gaudig, Anja; Hinderer, Sebastian; Morales Reyes, Carlos Arturo; Prochotta, Alicia; Steinbrink, Kathrin; Berger, Elisabeth S.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbvi.2020.e00169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbvi.2020.e00169,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jbvi.2020.e00169,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
3218,Transitioning to high efficiency air conditioning in Saudi Arabia: A benefit cost analysis for residential buildings,"Abstract This paper assesses the benefits of transitioning to high efficiency air conditioning (AC) equipment for existing units specific to the residential building stock in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The analysis is based on a calibrated residential building stock model for Saudi Arabia supported by national statistics regarding the characteristics of AC systems. Various housing prototypes, vintages, and locations are included in the analysis. Specifically, the analysis considers the scaling up of the government's High Efficiency AC (HEAC) program which offers 900 Saudi Riyals (240 USD) per unit to consumers for up to 6 split system units with an energy efficiency rating (EER) of 13.0 or more per household. The main findings of the study suggest that upgrading the existing old stock of window units and split systems currently in place to the requirements of HEAC program would generate a reduction in electricity consumption of around 33 TWh/year and 24 million tons of CO2. Due to the effect of the HEAC consumer subsidy, purchasing a high efficiency unit has a simple payback period for the consumer of 5 years which is faster than less efficient AC options. This would come at a cost to the government of approximately 6 Billion USD resulting in an annual income of 3.0 Billion USD from the sale of avoided fuel associated with the saved electricity consumption.","Krarti, M.; Howarth, Nicholas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101457,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101457,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101457,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27
3219,Current knowledge about the antivirals remdesivir (GS-5734) and GS-441524 as therapeutic options for coronaviruses,"Abstract Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies. In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.","Amirian, E.

Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts.

3222,Coalition: Advocacy for prospective clinical trials to test the post-exposure potential of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19,"Abstract Our coalition of public health experts, doctors, and scientists worldwide want to draw attention to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a post-exposure drug for exposed people, meaning people with close contact with positive tested patients, including home and medical caregivers. We have reviewed the mechanisms of antiviral effect of HCQ, the risk-benefit ratio taking into consideration the PK/PD of HCQ and the thresholds of efficacy. We have studied its use as an antimalarial, an antiviral, and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at does matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous, which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight (2,3), at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people.","Picot, Stephane; Marty, Aileen; Bienvenu, Anne-Lise; Blumberg, Lucille H.; Dupouy-Camet, Jean; Carnevale, Pierre; Kano, Shigeyuki; Jones, Malcolm K.; Daniel-Ribeiro, Cláudio Tadeu; Mas-Coma, Santiago",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,Elsevier,10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
3223,A “One-Health” approach for diagnosis and molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy,"Abstract The current pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) called SARS-CoV-2 (species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae). In Italy, up to the 2nd of April 2020, overall 139,422 confirmed cases and 17,669 deaths have been notified, while 26,491 people have recovered. Besides the overloading of hospitals, another issue to face was the capacity to perform thousands of tests per day. In this perspective, to support the National Health Care System and to minimize the impact of this rapidly spreading virus, the Italian Ministry of Health involved the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IZSs), Veterinary Public Health Institutes, in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by testing human samples. IZSAM, is currently testing more than 600 samples per day and WGS from positive samples. Sequence analysis of these samples suggested that outbreaks in Abruzzo region may be related to outbreaks of northern Italy and northern Europe, these latter as for the presence of mutations in the N protein. CoVs, and related diseases, are well known to veterinarians since decades. The experience that veterinarians operating within the Public health system gained in the control and characterization of previous health issues of livestock and poultry including avian flu, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, responsible for huge economic losses, is certainly of great help to minimize the impact of this global crisis.","Lorusso, Alessio; Calistri, Paolo; Mercante, Maria Teresa; Monaco, Federica; Portanti, Ottavio; Marcacci, Maurilia; Cammà, Cesare; Rinaldi, Antonio; Mangone, Iolanda; Di Pasquale, Adriano; Iommarini, Marino; Mattucci, Maria; Fazii, Paolo; Tarquini, Pierluigi; Mariani, Rinalda; Grimaldi, Alessandro; Morelli, Daniela; Migliorati, Giacomo; Savini, Giovanni; Borrello, Silvio; D'Alterio, Nicola",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100135,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100135,Elsevier,10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100135,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19
3224,Epitope based vaccine prediction for SARS-COV-2 by deploying immuno-informatics approach,"Abstract A new virus termed SARS-COV-2 (causing COVID-19 disease) can exhibit a progressive, fatal impact on individuals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the spread of the virus to be a global pandemic. Currently, there are over 1 million cases and over 100,000 confirmed deaths due to the virus. Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0–1 Å. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected. This new methodology of epitope-based vaccine prediction is fundamental and fast in application, ad can be economically beneficial and viable.","Joshi, Amit; Joshi, Bhuwan Chandra; Mannan, M.

3225,Efferocytosis and Its Associated Cytokines: A Light on Non-tumor and Tumor Diseases?,"Abstract Billions of cells undergo turnover and die via apoptosis throughout our lifetime. A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (atherosclerosis, lung diseases, etc.) and tumor diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α - and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.","Lin, Danfeng; Kang, Xiaodiao; Shen, Lu; Tu, Sheng; Lenahan, Cameron; Chen, Yiding; Wang, Xiaochen; Shao, Anwen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.omto.2020.04.010,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

3230,Investigating the cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China using dynamic statistical techniques,"Abstract The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia with unknown cause that appeared like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%–~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.","Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu; Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,Elsevier,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

(A mini review of some indirect evidence related to obesity),"ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new virus causing respiratory illness outbreak. Nowadays, COVID-19 has spread to several countries around the world and is presently a major global concern. It appears that no certain effective pharmaceutical agent is currently available for it. It seems that obesity is one of the biggest risk factors related to COVID-19 hospitalization and critical illness. The strengthening of the body systems by non-drug ways is very important especially in obese people. On the basis of some indirect evidence, it seems that moderate physical activity can be recommended as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and viable way to cope with corona. On the other hand, recommending higher intensity exercise needs further consideration to make final decision in this regard.","Rahmati-Ahmadabad, Saleh; Hosseini, Fahimeh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100245,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100245,Elsevier,10.1016/j.obmed.2020.100245,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

However, the cellular factors that control IFITM3 homeostasis and antiviral activity have not been fully elucidated. Using site-specific photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomic analysis, here we present the identification and functional characterization of VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase as a primary interaction partner of IFITM3. We show that IFITM3 ubiquitination at lysine 24 is crucial for VCP binding, trafficking, turnover, and engagement with incoming virus particles. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of VCP/p97 ATPase activity leads to defective IFITM3 lysosomal sorting, turnover, and co-trafficking with virus particles. Our results showcase the utility of site-specific protein photo-crosslinking in mammalian cells and reveal VCP/p97 as a key cellular factor involved in IFITM3 trafficking and homeostasis.","Wu, Xiaojun; Spence, Jennifer S.; Das, Tandrila; Yuan, Xiaoqiu; Chen, Chengjie; Zhang, Yuqing; Li, Yumeng; Sun, Yanan; Chandran, Kartik; Hang, Howard C.; Peng, Tao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

3245,Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Recommendations in Response to COVID-19,"Abstract Purpose During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusion Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.","Zaorsky, Nicholas G.; Yu, James B.; McBride, Sean M.; Dess, Robert T.; Jackson, William C.; Mahal, Brandon A.; Chen, Ronald; Choudhury, Ananya; Henry, Ann; Syndikus, Isabel; Mitin, Timur; Tree, Alison; Kishan, Amar U.; Spratt, Daniel E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

3247,Breast radiotherapy under COVID-19 pandemic resource constraints -- approaches to defer or shorten treatment from a Comprehensive Cancer Center in the United States,"Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","Braunstein, Lior Z.; Gillespie, Erin F.; Hong, Linda; Xu, Amy; Bakhoum, Samuel F.; Cuaron, John; Mueller, Boris; McCormick, Beryl; Cahlon, Oren; Powell, Simon; Khan, Atif J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

3255,Practice considerations for proton beam radiotherapy of uveal melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic: PTCOG Ocular experience,"Abstract Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare but life-threatening cancer of the eye. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and proton eye therapy facilities must analyze several factors to ensure appropriate treatment protocols for patients and provider teams. Practice considerations to limit COVID-19 transmission in the proton ocular treatment setting for UM are necessary. The Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) is the largest international community of particle/proton therapy providers. Participating experts are/were affiliated with the member institutions of the PTCOG Ocular subcommittee with long-standing high-volume proton ocular programs. The practices reviewed in this document must be taken in conjunction with local hospital procedures, multidisciplinary recommendations, and regional/national guidelines, as each community may have its unique needs, supplies, and protocols. Importantly, as the pandemic evolves, so will the strategies and recommendations. Given the unique circumstances for UM patients, along with indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission as a result of healthcare providers working in close proximity to patients and intrinsic infectious risk from eyelashes, tears and hair, practice strategies may be adapted to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.","Mishra, K.K.; Afshar, A.; Thariat, J.; Shih, H.A.; Scholey, J.E.; Daftari, I.K.; Kacperek, A.; Pica, A.; Hrbacek, J.; Dendale, R.; Mazal, A.; Heufelder, J.; Char, D.H.; Sauerwein, W.; Weber, D.C.; Damato, B.E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.010,23/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-23

Given concerns for rapidly rising infection rates in the US, impending staffing shortages, and potential for resource re-allocation, we rapidly re-evaluated our rectal cancer practice polices during this public health emergency. Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT). In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT). Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and LRCCT, adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity. In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be re-evaluated, as SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients, at a time when our resources are severely and acutely constrained.","Romesser, Paul B.; Wu, Abraham J.; Cercek, Andrea; Smith, J.

3258,Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Abstract Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. Methods All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO’s shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. Results Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO’s shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. Conclusions Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","Price, Alex; Henke, Lauren E.; Maraghechi, Borna; Kim, Taeho; Spraker, Matthew B.; Hugo, Geoffrey D.; Robinson, Clifford G.; Knutson, Nels C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.012,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28

3261,The Heart in COVID19: Primary Target or Secondary Bystander?,"Summary: In the throes of the current COVID-19 pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","Libby, Peter",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.001,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients. Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities. Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Ky, Bonnie; Mann, Douglas L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacbts.2020.04.003,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

3269,"Management of Patients on Dialysis and With Kidney Transplantation During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic in Brescia, Italy","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is a major pandemic challenging health care systems around the world. The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7–10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.","Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Piva, Simone; Latronico, Nicola; Focà, Emanuele; Castelli, Francesco; Gaggia, Paola; Movilli, Ezio; Bove, Sergio; Malberti, Fabio; Farina, Marco; Bracchi, Martina; Costantino, Ester Maria; Bossini, Nicola; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco; Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Zambetti, Nicole; Venturini, Margherita; Affatato, Stefania; Piarulli, Paola; Zappa, Mattia; Guerini, Alice; Boni, Francesca; Mucchetti, Alberto; Pezzini, Elena; Saccà, Chiara; Moscato, Marianna; Tonoli, Michela; Pasquali, Stefano; Viola, Fabio; Piva, Simone; Latronico, Nicola; Focà, Emanuele; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia; Castelli, Francesco; Gaggia, Paola; Movilli, Ezio; Bove, Sergio; Malberti, Fabio; Farina, Marco; Bracchi, Martina; Costantino, Ester Maria; Bossini, Nicola; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

3273,A COVID-19 epidemic model with latency period,"Abstract At the beginning of a COVID-19 infection, there is a period of time known as the exposed or latency period, before an infected person is capable of transmitting the infection to another person. We develop two differential equations models to account for this period. The first is a model that incorporates infected persons in the exposed class, before transmission is possible. The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible. We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases. We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.","Liu, Z.; Magal, P.; Seydi, Ousmane; Webb, Glenn",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.003,28/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-28
3274,Canada needs to rapidly escalate public health interventions for its COVID-19 mitigation strategies,"Abstract Background After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation. Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3–4 days.","Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Wu, Jianhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3276,Travel health risk perceptions of Chinese international students in Australia – Implications for COVID-19,"Abstract Background International students frequently return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR), and are at increased risk of travel-associated infections. Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. Results Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusion This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C.

3277,Hajj in the Time of COVID-19,"Abstract The recent outbreak of the novel COVID-19 is posing a severe public health risk across the globe. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is one of the greatest destinations of religious congregations of Muslims. One of the largest religious gatherings is the Hajj that is anticipated to produce serious challenges of mass level exposures and spread to every corner of the world. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah (KSA), must regularly analyze the prevailing situation of COVID-19, and involve the religious scholars to make appropriate decisions about Hajj 2020. Although the Saudi government has been continuously taking all possible measures to contain the pandemic, people's cooperation is crucial in the fight against COVID-19.","Atique, Suleman; Itumalla, Ramaiah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idh.2020.04.001,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

We highlight different scenarios in which endoscopy should still be performed urgently in patients with IBD, as well as recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment. We suggest a pathway for performing safe endoscopy and discuss the potential risks of postponing endoscopy in IBD. Finally, we propose a post-pandemic plan for access to endoscopy.","Iacucci, Marietta; Cannatelli, Rosanna; Labarile, Nunzia; Mao, Ren; Panaccione, Remo; Danese, Silvio; Kochhar, Gursimran S; Ghosh, Subrata; Shen, Bo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30119-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30119-9,Elsevier,10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30119-9,16/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-16

3294,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). Findings Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66–97) and 24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. Interpretation Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R 0 and the duration of infectiousness.

3301,Impact of school closures for COVID-19 on the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling study,"Summary Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. Methods For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3–12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8–15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. Interpretation School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

3307,Effect of changing case definitions for COVID-19 on the epidemic curve and transmission parameters in mainland China: a modelling study,"Summary Background When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance. Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. Methods We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8–10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9–4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6–7·3) from version 4 to 5. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232 000 (95% CrI 161 000–359 000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55 508 confirmed cases reported. Interpretation The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases. These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

3308,Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study,"Summary Background A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R t) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020. Findings COVID-19 transmissibility measured by R t has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated R t of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an R t of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. Interpretation Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

Soon after arrival at our facility, the patient decompensated, developing severe ARDS requiring intubation and prone positioning to maintain adequate oxygenation. Over the next few days, the patient developed acute kidney injury with oliguria and severe volume overload. The vascular surgery service was consulted to obtain central venous access for emergent CRRT. Upon our exam, the patient was sedated and paralyzed in a rotating prone-positioning bed. He could not be positioned supine without immediately becoming hypoxic and decompensating. A 50-cm Permcath was inserted via left popliteal vein.

3317,A perspective on hydrothermal processing of sewage sludge,"Abstract The US annually produces 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge. Anaerobic digestion can only reduce the sludge volume by 50% in mass, leaving the other half as a growing waste management and hygienic problem. Hydrothermal processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be used to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscalability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.","Chen, Wan-Ting; Haque, Md.

Matériel et méthode Recommandations sur le modèle des conférences de consensus. Résultats En cas de patiente positive COVID-19, il convient de différer la prise en charge chirurgicale d’au moins 15jours. Pour le cancer du col, la place de la chirurgie doit être ré-évaluée par rapport à la radiothérapie et la radio-chimiothérapie-concomitante et l’intérêt des chirurgies de stadification ganglionnaire doit être revu au cas par cas. Pour les cancers de l’ovaire de stade avancé, il convient de privilégier la chimiothérapie néo-adjuvante même si la chirurgie de cytoréduction première pourrait être envisageable. Il est licite de ne pas proposer la chimiothérapie hyperthermique intra-péritonéale en période de pandémie COVID-19. Pour les cas des patientes qui doivent bénéficier d’une chirurgie d’intervalle, il est possible de poursuivre la chimiothérapie et de proposer une chirurgie de clôture après 6 cycles de chimiothérapie. Pour le cancer de l’endomètre de stade précoce, en cas de risque ESMO préopératoire faible et intermédiaire, il faut privilégier une hystérectomie totale avec annexectomie bilatérale associée à une procédure du ganglion sentinelle. Il est licite d’envisager le report de 1 à 2 mois de la chirurgie dans les cancers de l’endomètre de bas risque (stade FIGO Ia sur l’IRM et cancer endométrioïde de grade 1-2 sur la biopsie endométriale). Pour les risques ESMO élevés, il semble légitime de privilégier l’algorithme du MSKCC (associant TEP TDM et procédure du GS) afin d’omettre les lympahdénectomies pelviennes et lomboaortiques.

Abstract Introduction Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Material and method Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","Akladios, C.; Azais, H.; Ballester, M.; Bendifallah, S.; Bolze, P.-A.; Bourdel, N.; Bricou, A.; Canlorbe, G.; Carcopino, X.; Chauvet, P.; Collinet, P.; Coutant, C.; Dabi, Y.; Dion, L.; Gauthier, T.; Graesslin, O.; Huchon, C.; Koskas, M.; Kridelka, F.; Lavoue, V.; Lecointre, L.; Mezzadri, M.; Mimoun, C.; Ouldamer, L.; Raimond, E.; Touboul, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.017,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

3323,Chapter One Neuropathy target esterase (NTE/PNPLA6) and organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN),"Abstract Systemic inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) with certain organophosphorus (OP) compounds produces OP compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN), a distal degeneration of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thereby providing a powerful model for studying a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right, but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts. In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness. Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders. This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN. It then briefly describes subsequent studies of NTE, including practical applications of the assay; aspects of its domain structure, subcellular localization, and tissue expression; abnormalities associated with NTE mutations, knockdown, and conventional or conditional knockout; and hypothetical models to help guide future research on elucidating the role of NTE in OPIDN.","Richardson, Rudy J.; Fink, John K.; Glynn, Paul; Hufnagel, Robert B.; Makhaeva, Galina F.; Wijeyesakere, Sanjeeva J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.ant.2020.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ant.2020.01.001,Elsevier,10.1016/bs.ant.2020.01.001,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Materials and method The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1–2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1–2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).

Early identification of respiratory viruses could result in a decrease in the use of antibiotics. Methods Observational, retrospective study from January 2014 to June 2018, that included paediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in a tertiary hospital, in which antigenic tests and/or viral PCR on a respiratory sample was performed. Results A total of 105 CAP episodes were included, with identification of a respiratory virus in 93 (88.6%) cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection had a lower onset of empirical antibiotic therapy (35.1% vs. 55.9%, p-value=.042). In addition, cases with RSV or influenza identification required shorter duration of antibiotic therapy (receiving 45.6% ≥2 days vs. 68.8% of those not identified, p =.017).

3332,Medical masks and Respirators for the Protection of Healthcare Workers from SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses,"Abstract The use of medical masks and respirators as personal protective equipment is pivotal to reducing the level of biological hazard to which healthcare workers are exposed during the outbreak of highly diffusible pathogens, such as the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, during this pandemic, supplies are rapidly running out worldwide, with potential consequences for the rate of occupational infections. Also, knowledge about specific characteristics of respirators is of utmost importance to select the proper type according to the clinical setting. A wide variety of literature is available on the topic, but mostly based on Influenza viruses infection models. Clinical evidence on the use of respirators is poor and interest in the topic has not been constant over time. A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed, together with high-quality clinical data on the use of respirators or alternative devices. Moreover, healthcare workers, regardless of their level of experience, should receive specific training.

3335,COVID-19 pandemic and non invasive respiratory management: every Goliath needs a David. An evidence based evaluation of problems.,"Abstract Background and aim The war against Covid-19 is far from won. This narrative review attempts to describe some problems with the management of Covid-19 induced acute respiratory failure (ARF) by pulmonologists. Methods We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reviewed the references of retrieved articles for additional studies. The search was limited to the terms: Covid-19 AND: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), SARS, MERS, non invasive ventilation (NIV), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), pronation (PP), health care workers (HCW). Results Protection of Health care workers should be paramount, so full Personal Protective Equipment and Negative pressure rooms are warranted. HFNC alone or with PP could be offered for mild cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 200-300); NIV alone or with PP may work in moderate cases (PaO2/FiO2 between 100-200). Rotation and coupled (HFNC/NIV) strategy can be beneficial. A window of opportunity of 1-2hours is advised. If PaO2/FIO2 significantly increases, Respiratory Rate decreases with a relatively low Exhaled Tidal Volume, the non-invasive strategy could be working and intubation delayed. Conclusion Although there is a role for non-invasive respiratory therapies in the context of COVID-19 ARF, more research is still needed to define the balance of benefits and risks to patients and HCW. Indirectly, non invasive respiratory therapies may be of particular benefit in reducing the risks to healthcare workers by obviating the need for intubation, a potentially highly infectious procedure.","Winck, João Carlos; Ambrosino, Nicolino",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.04.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.04.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.04.013,27/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-27

Cancer patients are in risk for severe disease, including a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for invasive ventilation or death. Management of patients with lymphoid malignancies can be challenging during the outbreak, due to need of multiple hospital visits and admissions, immunosuppression and need for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. In this article, we will focus on the practical management of patients with lymphoid malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on minimizing the risk for patients.","Perini, Guilherme Fleury; Fischer, Thais; Gaiolla, Rafael Dezen; Rocha, Talita Bueno; Bellesso, Marcelo; Teixeira, Larissa Lane Cardoso; Delamain, Marcia Torresan; Scheliga, Adriana Alves de Souza; Ribeiro, Glaciano Nogueira; Neto, Jorge Vaz; Baiocchi, Otávio Cesar Carvalho Guimaraes; Abdo, André Neder Ramires; Arrais-Rodrigues, Celso; Fogliatto, Laura M.; Bigni, Ricardo de Sá; Schaffel, Rony; Biasoli, Irene; Pereira, Juliana; Nablan, Samir Kanaan; Souza, Cármino Antônio de; Chiattone, Carlos Sérgio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.htct.2020.04.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

3347,Les séquelles de virose en pneumopédiatrie,"Résumé L’immaturité du système immunitaire explique une part de la vulnérabilité aux pathogènes respiratoires durant l’enfance. Une infection virale respiratoire aiguë chez l’enfant peut être secondaire à 1 des 200 virus génétiquement différents et identifiables par les outils moléculaires. Les cellules ciliées distribuées tout au long de l’épithélium des voies respiratoires sont la cible des virus. Les études épidémiologiques rapportent une diminution de la fonction respiratoire chez l’adulte indépendamment de facteurs confondants lorsqu’une pneumonie est survenue avant l’âge de 2 voire 7 ans. Cette réduction de la fonction respiratoire est le reflet probable de l’atteinte initiale malgré les processus de réparation (altération potentielle de croissance pulmonaire) et à l’âge adulte d’une accélération du déclin physiologique des capacités ventilatoires. Les études portant sur l’origine des dilatations des bronches retrouvent des antécédents de pneumopathies infectieuses plus d’une fois sur deux. Les infections à adénovirus sont particulièrement en cause. Une bronchiolite obstructive post-infectieuse peut survenir même chez l’enfant immunocompétent ; le tableau initial est très souvent pseudo-grippal, puis est marqué par une dissociation entre des signes fonctionnels importants et un examen clinique pauvre. L’évolution au long cours est peu prévisible mais peut conduire à l’insuffisance respiratoire chronique létale. Les pneumopathies infiltratives diffuses sont caractérisées par une infiltration diffuse de la charpente conjonctivale du poumon par des cellules inflammatoires et de la fibrose. Le rôle des virus dans son développement a été évoqué en raison de la présence d’inclusions cellulaires évoquant des particules virales dans le poumon d’enfants atteints. Enfin la plupart des études épidémiologiques soulignent l’association entre une symptomatologie sifflante secondaire à une agression virale durant l’enfance et le risque ultérieur de développement d’un asthme. Summary Community-acquired viral bronchopneumonia is frequent, particularly in children, and can be associated with all types of respiratory viruses. Immature immunity explains the vulnerability to respiratory pathogens during childhood. Epithelial cells distributed throughout the airway epithelium are the target of viruses. Epidemiological studies report a decrease in respiratory function in adults, regardless of confounding factors, who had pneumonia before the age of 2 or even 7years. This reduction in respiratory function is a consequence of the initial involvement and of the accelerated physiological decline in adulthood. Studies on the origin of bronchial dilatation have found a history of infectious pneumonia in more than 50% of cases. Adenoviral infections in particular are involved. Postinfectious obstructive bronchiolitis can occur even in immunocompetent children. The initial clinical picture is often flu-like, and is subsequently marked by a dissociation between important functional signs and a poor clinical presentation. The long-term course is not predictable but can lead to lethal chronic respiratory failure. Diffuse infiltrative pneumonitis is characterized by pulmonary diffuse infiltration with inflammatory cells and fibrosis. The role of viruses in its development has been mentioned due to the presence of cellular inclusions evoking viral particles in the lungs of affected children. Finally, most epidemiological studies emphasize the association between wheezing symptoms secondary to viral infection in childhood and the subsequent risk of developing asthma.","Brouard, J.; Vallet, C.; Marie, J.; Faucon, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.007,21/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-21
3348,"Antiviraux chez l’enfant en pratique de ville : infections herpétiques, varicelle, grippe","Résumé Les infections liées à l’herpès virus humain (HSV), au virus de la varicelle et du zona (VZV) et au virus de la grippe (Influenza A et B) sont très fréquentes en pédiatrie et sont le plus souvent bénignes avec une guérison spontanée. L’utilisation des antiviraux antigrippaux (inhibiteurs de neuraminidase) a été étudiée dans de larges essais randomisés et fait l’objet de recommandations nationales et internationales. Celle des anti-HSV et anti-VZV n’a pas fait l’objet d’études de la même ampleur et de ce fait, leur prescription est plus discutée avec des bénéfices moins bien définis et variables (à l’exception des infections néonatales et/ou neuro-méningées). L’objectif de cette mise au point est donc de proposer une synthèse des données disponibles dans la littérature concernant les indications des antiviraux en pratique de ville pour les infections liées à l’HSV (gingivostomatite, herpès récurrent, faux panaris herpétique), au VZV (varicelle, zona) et à la grippe. Summary Human herpes virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the flu (influenza A and B) are very common in pediatrics and most often cause mild disease with spontaneous recovery. The use of influenza antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors) has been studied in large randomized trials and is the focus of national and international recommendations. The use of anti-HSV and VZV compounds has not been the subject of large studies and is often more controversial (except for neonatal infection and/or meningoencephalitis). The objective of this review is therefore to offer an overview of the available data in the literature on the indications for antivirals for HSV-related infections (gingivostomatitis, recurrent herpes, herpetic whitlow), VZV (chickenpox, herpes zoster), and influenza in a pediatric outpatient setting.","Launay, E.; Gras Le Guen, C.; Pinquier, D.; Dommergues, M.-A.; Cohen, R.; Grimprel, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

3350,Deliberate release: Plague – A review,"Abstract Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

3353,"American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) Presidential Address Themes, 1964-2018: Revisiting Our History as We Move Forward","Abstract The American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) was established in 1946. Since then, significant advances have been made in diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the upper extremity. However, there has been little documentation regarding how the largest and oldest society dedicated to hand surgery has evolved over time. Further, an understanding of the history of the ASSH and the specialty of hand surgery should be emphasized in resident and fellow education. The authors aim to provide a historical overview of the ASSH through the speeches of ASSH past presidents which sheds light on future directions and long-term goals. Presidential addresses from 1961 to 2018 (courtesy of ASSH Chase Library historical archives) were reviewed. The overall percentage of ASSH presidents by specialty was 67% orthopaedic, 25% plastic surgery, and 8% general surgery. The most common speech theme overall was “how to be a good hand surgeon” (31%). The most common speech themes were as follows by decade: 1960’s, “history and the current state of ASSH”; 1970’s and 80’s “assessments of how to be a good surgeon” and “goals for ASSH”; 1990’s, “healthcare and governmental regulation”; 2000’s, “how to be a better hand surgeon”; 2010’s “goals for ASSH”. In earlier years, there was more of a focus on education and technical skill development in the ASSH. Work-life balance, introduced in the 1990s, has become more of a focus in the past 20 years. Revisiting the history of the ASSH and its goals allows us to reflect on the progress made while recognizing what is important as we look into the future. Further, as we strive to make progress in the field of hand surgery during the current pandemic, valuable tools surface that will allow the specialty to strengthen its education, research, and patient care delivery in the future.","Azoury, Saïd C.; John, Tamara; Cheema, Adnan N.; Behar, Brittany J.; Zapolsky, Ivan; Levin, L.

3355,Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures,"Abstract Background A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Methods We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Findings Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million. Interpretation Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","Wu, Huai-liang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J.P.; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-Kit",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
3356,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection,"Abstract Background The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide. In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43–63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. Interpretation In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44·1%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20·5%.

3360,What are the Underlying Transmission Patterns of COVID-19 Outbreak? – An Age-specific Social Contact Characterization,"Abstract Background COVID-19 has spread to 6 continents. Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. Methods In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. Findings We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. Interpretation With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

3370,Pathogenic priming likely contributes to serious and critical illness and mortality in COVID-19 via autoimmunity,"Abstract Homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral- or vaccine-induced autoimmunity. Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of “immune enhancement”). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.","Lyons-Weiler, James",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtauto.2020.100051,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtauto.2020.100051,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jtauto.2020.100051,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3372,"Outcome of Coronavirus spectrum infections (SARS, MERS, COVID 1 -19) during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis","ABSTRACT Objective The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for “coronavirus” or “severe acute respiratory syndrome” or “SARS” or “Middle East respiratory syndrome” or “MERS” or “COVID-19” and “pregnancy”. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.","Di Mascio, Daniele; Khalil, Asma; Saccone, Gabriele; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Buca, Danilo; Liberati, Marco; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Nappi, Luigi; Scambia, Giovanni; Berghella, Vincenzo; D’Antonio, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

3376,Coronavirus disease 2019 infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women: two weeks of confirmed presentations to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly spreading throughout the New York metropolitan area since its first reported case on March 1, 2020. The state is now the epicenter of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early case series with 7 coronavirus disease 2019–positive pregnant patients, 2 of whom were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 after an initial asymptomatic presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-positive cases of coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals for more than 2 weeks, from March 13, 2020, to March 27, 2020. A total of 14 patients (32.6%) presented without any coronavirus disease 2019–associated viral symptoms and were identified after they developed symptoms during admission or after the implementation of universal testing for all obstetric admissions on March 22. Among them, 10 patients (71.4%) developed symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of the other 29 patients (67.4%) who presented with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019, 3 women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and another patient re-presented with worsening respiratory status requiring oxygen supplementation 6 days postpartum after a successful labor induction. There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Based on coronavirus disease 2019 disease severity characteristics by Wu and McGoogan, 37 women (86%) exhibited mild disease, 4 (9.3%) severe disease, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described in nonpregnant adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).","Breslin, Noelle; Baptiste, Caitlin; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Miller, Russell; Martinez, Rebecca; Bernstein, Kyra; Ring, Laurence; Landau, Ruth; Purisch, Stephanie; Friedman, Alexander M.; Fuchs, Karin; Sutton, Desmond; Andrikopoulou, Maria; Rupley, Devon; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Aubey, Janice; Zork, Noelia; Moroz, Leslie; Mourad, Mirella; Wapner, Ronald; Simpson, Lynn L.; D’Alton, Mary E.; Goffman, Dena",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

3378,Forecasting the Impact of Coronavirus Disease During Delivery Hospitalization: An Aid for Resources Utilization,"Abstract Background The ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely impacted the United States. In cases of infectious disease outbreak, forecasting models are often developed for resources utilization. Pregnancy and delivery pose unique challenges, given the altered maternal immune system and the fact that the majority of American women choose to deliver in the hospital setting. Objectives The aim of our study is to forecast the incidence of COVID-19 in general population and to forecast the overall incidence, severe cases, critical cases and fatal COVID-19 cases during delivery hospitalization in the United States. Study design We use a phenomenological model with generalized logistic growth models to forecast the incidence of COVID-19 in the United States from 4/15/2020 – 12/31/2020. Incidence data from 3/1/2020 – 4/14/2020 were used to provide best-fit model solution. Subsequently, Monte-Carlo simulation was performed for each week from 3/1/2020 – 12/31/2020 to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in delivery hospitalizations using the available data estimate. Results From 3/1/2020 – 12/31/2020, our model forecasted a total of 860,475 cases of COVID-19 in general population across the United States. The cumulative incidence for COVID-19 during delivery hospitalization is anticipated to be 16,601 (95% CI, 9,711 – 23,491) cases. Among those, 3,308 (95% CI, 1,755 – 4,861) cases are expected to be severe, 681 (95% CI, 1324 – 1,038) critical and 52 (95% CI, 23 – 81) maternal mortality. Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year of 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the US to at least 18.7 (95% CI, 18.0 – 19.5) deaths per 100,000 live birth as a direct result of COVID-19. Conclusions COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is expected to severely impact obstetrical care. From 3/1/2020 – 12/31/2020, we project 3,308 severe and 681 critical cases, with about 52 COVID-19 related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization in the United States.

3381,"Assessment of the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number, R 0, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy","Abstract As of March 12th Italy has the largest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Europe as well as outside China. The infections, first limited in Northern Italy, have eventually spread to all other regions. When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R 0, i.e. the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. Previous work has been limited to the assessment of R 0 analyzing data from the Wuhan region or Mainland China. In the present study the R 0 value for SARS-CoV-2 was assessed analyzing data derived from the early phase of the outbreak in Italy. In particular, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in 9 cities (those with the largest number of infections) fitting the well-established SIR-model to available data in the interval between February 25–March 12, 2020. The findings of this study suggest that R 0 values associated with the Italian outbreak may range from 2.43 to 3.10, confirming previous evidence in the literature reporting similar R 0 values for SARS-CoV-2.","D'Arienzo, Marco; Coniglio, Angela",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

3387,Therapeutic Management of COVID-19 Patients: A systematic review,"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19; that has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines vary in each country, and yet there is no approved therapeutic for COVID-19. Aims of the study this review aimed to report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice since the emergence of the virus. Methods A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA Statement. Articles for review were selected from electronic databases (Embase, Medline and Google Scholar). Readily accessible peer-reviewed, full articles in English published from December 1st , 2019 to March 26th , 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral and antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the type of study design eligible for inclusion. Results As of March 26th, 2020, of the initial manuscripts identified (n=449); forty-one studies were included. These consisted of clinical trials (n=3), case reports (n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). The most commonly reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and Oseltamivir (n=16). Conclusions This is the first systematic review to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only 41 research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China. Corticosteroid therapy was found to be the most studied medicine in the literature.","Tobaiqy, Mansour; Qashqary, Mohammed; Al-Dahery, Shrooq; Mujallad, Alaa; Hershan, Almonther Abdullah; Kamal, Mohammad Azhar; Helmi, Nawal",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100061,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100061,Elsevier,10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100061,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
3388,The role of afferent pulmonary innervation in poor prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients and proposed use of resiniferatoxin (RTX) to improve patient outcomes in advanced disease state: A review,"Abstract Acute respiratory distress is one of the major causes of mortality associated with COVID-19 disease. Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","Nahama, Alexis; Ramachandran, Roshni; Cisternas, Alvaro Francisco; Ji, Henry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

3391,Target Virus or Target Ourselves for COVID-19 Drugs Discovery?-Lessons learned from anti-influenzas virus therapies,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic, after it was reported in December 2019, is a highly contagious and now spreading to over 190 countries, causing a severe public health burden. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-2-CoV. For this emergency, the FDA has approved Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization. However, even after this pandemic, COVID-19 may still have a chance to come back. Therefore, we need to come out with new strategies for drug discovery for combating COVID-19 in the future.","Liao, Jiayu; Way, George; Madahar, Vipul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100037,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100037,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
3392,PAK1-blockers: Potential Therapeutics against COVID-19,"ABSTRACT PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1) is the major “pathogenic” kinase whose abnormal activation causes a wide variety of diseases/disorders including cancers, inflammation, malaria and pandemic viral infection including influenza, HIV and COVID-19. Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of “specific” vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treatment of viral infection. However, it takes 12–18 months till the effective vaccine becomes available. Until then ventilator (O2 supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients. Thus, as alternative potentially more direct “broad-spectrum” COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.","Maruta, Hiroshi; He, Hong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100039,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100039,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

3394,Perspectives for the use of therapeutic Botulinum toxin as a multifaceted candidate drug to attenuate COVID-19,"Abstract The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resulting from a distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve in many countries and pose life-threatening clinical issues to global public health. While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. Presently, there is an urgent need for a remedial measure to combat this devastating COVID-19. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human. However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.","Kandasamy, Mahesh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100042,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100042,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100042,29/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-29

This article focuses on how Korean health officials implemented drive-through and walk-through diagnostic testing, and extensive movement and contact tracing, to identify and inform exposed members of the public. Mobile applications from both government agencies and private developers played an important role in guiding people to testing centers, communicating movement trajectories of confirmed cases on digital maps, and tracking the health and movements of travelers and others at risk of exposure.

3398,The effect of COVID-19 and subsequent social distancing on travel behavior,"Abstract The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in unprecedented measures restricting travel and activity participation in many countries. Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.","De Vos, Jonas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121,Elsevier,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121,24/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-24

Materials and Methods Thirty-six Holstein bull calves (1 d of age) from a commercial calf ranch were assigned to either a high plane of milk-replacer nutrition (HPN; n = 18; 20 and 28% DM lipid and protein, respectively, Cow’s Match, Land O’Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co., Shoreview, MN) or a low plane of milk-replacer nutrition (LPN; n = 18; 20% DM lipid and protein, Herd Maker, Land O’Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co.) through weaning. Total serum protein concentrations confirmed that 72 and 76% of calves had failure of passive transfer (<5.2 g/dL) in HPN and LPN, respectively. All calves were bottle fed twice daily. The LPN were fed 455 g of DM/d of milk replacer (MR) until weaning, and the HPN calves were fed 830 g of DM/d of milk replacer during the first 10 d and 1,080 g from 11 d until weaning. Calf starter and water were offered ad libitum. Calves were step-down weaned beginning at 51 d and completely weaned after 58 d when consuming 1 kg of calf starter (as-fed basis). Data are reported as HPN versus LPN throughout, respectively. Results and Discussion Risk for bloat and scouring were greater for calves fed the HPN, but there was no difference in antibiotic treatment or mortality. The HPN calves had greater performance over the preweaning period including final BW, ADG, and feed:gain (total kg of milk replacer + calf starter, kg of DM/kg of BW gain), but weaning was more stressful for HPN calves. Implications and Applications In conclusion, the high-risk calves fed a HPN had increased preweaning ADG, but there was also an increased incidence of scours. There may be differences in the health status of calves that may affect the ability to consume and use high MR levels. When feeding high-risk calves there may be a need for alternate strategies when determining the quality and quantity of MR being fed when compared with low-risk calves. Differences in gut integrity may influence the ability of high-risk calves to handle high levels of MR early in life. Potential issues with high-risk calves being fed a HPN might be reduced with increased feeding times per day, a gradual step-up method, or other nutritional strategies that improve gastrointestinal development and function.","Sharon, K.P.; Hulbert, L.E.; Davis, E.M.; Ballou, M.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2019-01886,https://doi.org/10.15232/aas.2019-01886,Elsevier,10.15232/aas.2019-01886,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3405,An increasing risk of family violence during the Covid-19 pandemic: Strengthening community collaborations to save lives,"Abstract Though necessary to slow the spread of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19), actions such as social-distancing, sheltering in-place, restricted travel, and closures of key community foundations are likely to dramatically increase the risk for family violence around the globe. In fact many countries are already indicating a dramatic increase in reported cases of domestic violence. While no clear precedent for the current crisis exists in academic literature, exploring the impact of natural disasters on family violence reports may provide important insight for family violence victim-serving professionals. Improving collaborations between human welfare and animal welfare agencies, expanding community partnerships, and informing the public of the great importance of reporting any concerns of abuse are all critical at this time.","Campbell, Andrew M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100089,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100089,Elsevier,10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100089,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3406,COVID-19 and pets: When pandemic meets panic,"Abstract As the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads globally with devastating effects on human health, pets are also becoming unnecessary victims amidst the pandemic panic. Many have been reluctantly left home alone by owners who have been forced to temporarily evacuate their homes. And, although no evidence exists to indicate that they can either transmit the virus or develop its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear among the public that pets might play a role in spreading COVID-19 has resulted in pets being abandoned or even killed. This article outlines some of the ways in which the current pandemic has negatively impacted the welfare of pets. It also highlights the relationships between animal, human, and environmental health, as well as the importance of taking a collaborative transdisciplinary One Health approach to help prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Parry, Nicola M.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090,Elsevier,10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

This dramatic change has forced our leaders to critically evaluate the delivery of education and skills training for our residents, fellows as well as all orthopaedic surgeons.

3416,Recommendation to Optimize Safety of Elective Surgical Care While Limiting the Spread of COVID-19: Primum Non Nocere,"Abstract COVID-19 has drastically altered our lives in an unprecedented manner, shuttering industries, and leaving most of the country in isolation as we adapt to the evolving crisis. Orthopedic surgery has not been spared from these effects, with the postponement of elective procedures in an attempt to mitigate disease transmission and preserve hospital resources as the pandemic continues to expand. During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that while patient and care-providers safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences, and may be irreversibly detrimental to a patient’s health and quality of life in some cases. The optimal solution of how to effectively balance the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined, and could include strategies such as social distancing, screening forms and tests including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health-care providers. Of importance, these recommendations do not and should not supersede evolving United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and relevant federal, state and local public health guidelines.

3433,COVID-19 Clinical Trials: A Primer for the Cardiovascular and Cardio-Oncology Communities,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients. Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities. Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Ky, Bonnie; Mann, Douglas L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.04.002,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17

3435,Implications for forensic death investigations from first Swiss post-mortem CT in a case of non-hospital treatment with COVID-19,"Abstract Case details: A case of a 50-year old HIV-positive man is presented, with focus on visualization of post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) of the lungs, in comparison to a forensic control case. He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any ”normal” post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.","Schweitzer, Wolf; Ruder, Thomas; Baumeister, Rilana; Bolliger, Stephan; Thali, Michael; Meixner, Eva; Ampanozi, Garyfalia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fri.2020.200378,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fri.2020.200378,Elsevier,10.1016/j.fri.2020.200378,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

His/her modus operandi consisted of email masquerading as the Director of the School in an attempt to induce the victims to buy digital gift cards and to transmit the card usage code to the perpetrator. The first author of this paper is the Director of the School, and the second is an expert in digital forensic science and a professor of the School. They worked together in real time to deal with the fraud. Because the fraud occurred in a School of forensic science and criminology, it raised many questions on a variety of overlapping dimensions. The objective of this study was, therefore, to draw lessons from this case from several perspectives ranging from forensic science to cybersecurity, and from practical to academic. The response to the incident has been treated in four typical distinguishable phases: (1) fraud detection; (2) crisis management; (3) post-incident analysis; and (4) reporting to different communities. We conclude this paper by taking lessons from the case to express the essential role of forensic knowledge and crime analysis in interpreting the information conveyed by digital traces to develop innovative cross-disciplinary models for preventing, detecting, analysing, investigating and responding to online fraud.","Ribaux, Olivier; Souvignet, Thomas R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2020.300978,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2020.300978,Elsevier,10.1016/j.fsidi.2020.300978,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

Both paper-based microfluidic devices (μPADs) and paper-based cultures and scaffolds have shown immense potential to be used as a sensor as well as a supporting material for in vitro tissue engineering. μPADs can be used to perform low-cost and fast biomolecular assays at Point-Of-Care (POC). They are being used to detect various biomarkers like viral proteins, metabolites, oncogenes, and antigens; and conditions like Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). On the other hand, the paper has also been used to develop paper-based 3D cultures and scaffolds to test drugs, and monitor cytotoxic effects in vitro cell microenvironments and also as implantable tissues. In this review, we intend to enumerate the development in the field of μPADs, paper-based cell cultures, and paper-based scaffolds and their plethora of applications over the last decade.","Deka, Bimalendu; Kalita, Rima; Bhatia, Dinesh; Mishra, Animesh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sintl.2020.100004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sintl.2020.100004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sintl.2020.100004,09/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-09

3439,Medically unexplained symptoms in the times of Covid-19 pandemic: a case-report,"Abstract In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to a potentially fatal condition was discovered. Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073,19/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-19

3449,"Comparative tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with implications for clinical manifestations, transmissibility, and laboratory studies of COVID-19: an observational study","Summary Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from China in January, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus–host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown. Methods We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA. Findings SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0·52). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0·0098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0·036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0·016; FRhK4, p=0·0004). Interpretation As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

3451,COVID-19: Challenges to GIS with Big Data,"Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy. Currently and for a long time in the future, the development of GIS should be strengthened to form a data-driven system for rapid knowledge acquisition, which signifies that GIS should be used to reinforce the social operation parameterization of models and methods, especially when providing support for social management.","Zhou, Chenghu; Su, Fenzhen; Pei, Tao; Zhang, An; Du, Yunyan; Luo, Bin; Cao, Zhidong; Wang, Juanle; Yuan, Wen; Zhu, Yunqiang; Song, Ci; Chen, Jie; Xu, Jun; Li, Fujia; Ma, Ting; Jiang, Lili; Yan, Fengqin; Yi, Jiawei; Hu, Yunfeng; Liao, Yilan; Xiao, Han",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
3452,COVID-19 in the Shadows of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance","Memish, Mazin Barry; Maha Al, Amri; Ziad, A.",https://www.doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003,CZI,MA ID 2093640054,2020,NA,NA,2020

3454,Uncertainties about the transmission routes of 2019 novel coronavirus,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (now named as SARS‐CoV‐2) caused an outbreak of SARS‐like illness in the late of December 2019. At present, the origin, susceptible population, and infection sources already have been clear.1, 2 However, the transmission routes, a key step to the epidemic control, have not yet been fully ascertained. Here, we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic recently. SARS‐CoV‐2, similar to SARS and MERS, is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high infectivity. It is commonly recognized that droplet transmission is the main route. Spread by aerosol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but unestablished now. Epidemiological experts, as well as the WHO, consider more evidence is needed to confirm.3 Besides, there are other routes except respiratory transmission. The previous study indicated that different human coronaviruses, such as SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, can maintain infectious for a different time on inanimate surfaces.4 Meanwhile, it was reported that SARS‐CoV‐2 was also founded on the surface of the door handles, cell phones, and other items in the residential sites of confirmed cases.5 Therefore, individuals will be probably infected if they touch the nose, mouth, or eyes after contacting the contaminated items.","Han, Qingmei; Lin, Qingqing; Ni, Zuowei; You, Liangshun",https://www.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12735,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12735,CZI,MA ID 3002533591,2020,NA,NA,2020

3456,The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2,"The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.","Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Baker, Susan C.; Baric, Ralph S.; de Groot, Raoul J.; Drosten, Christian; Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.; Haagmans, Bart L.; Lauber, Chris; Leontovich, Andrey M.; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Penzar, Dmitry; Perlman, Stanley; Poon, Leo L.

3461,"2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: Human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness","On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454","Seah, Ivan; Su, Xinyi; Lingam, Gopal",https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7,CZI,MA ID 3005477973,2020,NA,NA,2020

Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.Results Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.Conclusion As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.","Xu, Xiao-Wei; Wu, Xiao-Xin; Jiang, Xian-Gao; Xu, Kai-Jin; Ying, Ling-Jun; Ma, Chun-Lian; Li, Shi-Bo; Wang, Hua-Ying; Zhang, Sheng; Gao, Hai-Nv; Sheng, Ji-Fang; Cai, Hong-Liu; Qiu, Yun-Qing; Li, Lan-Juan",https://www.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m606,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m606,CZI,MA ID 3001118548,2020,NA,NA,2020
3465,Editor's Note,"A few years ago, when I wrote an editorial note, there was an unseasonable heavy snowfall,making the city of Tokyo havoc. This time the cause is the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).Infection by this novel virus had become grave news involving the whole world by the end ofJanuary. Now, as I am writing this, there is no cure, and the number of patients is also increasingday by day in Japan. Masks are out of stock throughout the city, and I have heard that people queueup for few masks in front of drug stores from early in the morning.The effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent infection is limited. What is the cause of such asituation? As a matter of fact, in an epidemic of infection, the most serious problem is not infectionitself, but unscientific rumors and people who are easily swayed by them. Avoidance of vaccinationby insisting that vaccines have no effect or that they are harmful to the body is fundamentally thesame. The anti-vaccination movement still exists despite the evidence-based medicine, and thereare concerns about its expansion. However, even with scientific evidence, it is not easy to persuadeanti-vaccinationists, and this is the moment, when we, academia, feel powerless.Nevertheless, we should not be discouraged. The mission of academia is to conduct reliableresearch. Reliable data are obtained from such research, and scientific solution of the problemssteadily proceed. Based on the outcomes of these data and solutions, scientists themselves shouldcreate the methods of advocacy and persuasion or rely on experts in this area.However, scientists should solve the problems with science.

Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.","Yee, Jane; Unger, Lucy; Zadravecz, Frank; Cariello, Paloma; Seibert, Allan; Johnson, Michael Austin; Fuller, Matthew Joseph",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12034,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12034,CZI,MA ID 3005586004,2020,NA,NA,2020

The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery. For confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.","Panahi, Latif; Amiri, Marzieh; Pouy, Somaye",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092922/,PMC,CORD-19 ID djuomhww,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death. Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection. In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation. Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.","Gharebaghi, Reza; Heidary, Fatemeh; Moradi, Mohammad; Parvizi, Maryam",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114714/,PMC,CORD-19 ID cw76d00e,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

3479,"Daily Situation Report on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran; March 22, 2020","To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. METHODS: We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. RESULTS: Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month.

In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19. METHOD: An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. RESULTS: Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.","Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Zali, Alireza; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Zarghi, Afshin; Hosseini, Mostafa; Safari, Saeed",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156260/,PMC,CORD-19 ID jlqee1b8,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

3514,Chapter 4 Current trends of antimicrobials used in food animals and aquaculture,"Abstract Human population has been increasing rapidly, which ultimately increases human consumption, especially, animal protein requirements. Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe's emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration. The contribution of resistant microbes from various sources seems to be the major base of resistance in the environment. However, strict policies and regulations for antimicrobial usage in food animals and aquaculture must be made and applied. It is important to prevent their negative effects in humans, food animals, aquaculture, and the environment.","Ibrahim, Muhammad; Ahmad, Fiaz; Yaqub, Bushra; Ramzan, Ayesha; Imran, Ayesha; Afzaal, Muhammad; Mirza, Safdar Ali; Mazhar, Iqra; Younus, Muhammad; Akram, Qaisar; Ali Taseer, Muhammad Sulman; Ahmad, Ali; Ahmed, Sarfraz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3516,Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study,"Summary Background An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. Methods We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. Findings We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R t) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R t, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

3519,Chapter 20 Reproductive management of poultry,"Abstract Based on data from the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization, about 120 million metric tons of poultry meat were produced globally in 2016. In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today's poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire Müllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.","Scanes, Colin G.; Butler, Leasea D.; Kidd, Michael T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3524,Chapter 7 Biofiltration technique for removal of waterborne pathogens,"Abstract Pathogenic agents such as protozoa, bacteria, virus, and helminths disseminate among human community via ingestion of contaminated water and pose a serious concern to public health. Biological filtration method of disinfection is the key step in centralized multistep and decentralized point-of-use water treatment system. A biofilm of indigenous microorganisms fixed on solid surface, called biofilter, is an eco-friendly and economic technique for removal of pollutants and pathogens. Stone, gravel, sand, soil, compost, mesoporous mineral stone, wood chips, etc., exemplify solid bed medium which provide enhanced surface area for microbial adherence and water retention. Slow sand filter (SSF) characterized by slow flow rate (0.1–0.2m3/h) and a biological layer over filter bed called schmutzdecke is fairly efficient in removal of coliform microorganisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, total coliform and fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, bacteriophage, and MS2 virus from wastewater. Rapid sand filter characterized by coarser sand and higher flow rate than SSF removes indicator microorganisms efficiently. Stormwater biofilter is popular and effective method for removal of pathogen and involves biological activity and physical retention of pathogen on filter media. Microbial diversity, inoculum size, pH and moisture of medium, temperature, and nutrient content are key parameters governing optimum performance of biofilter system. Therefore, biofiltration can be an efficient bioremediation technology for pathogen removal.","Maurya, Anurag; Singh, Manoj Kumar; Kumar, Sushil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3525,"COVID-19: Disease, management, treatment, and social impact","Abstract COVID-19 was originated from Wuhan city of Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories. It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems. The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally. The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million. Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease. However, prevention and management are the best options. This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society. It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms. However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment. It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst. Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future; if any. There is no need to be panic and proper prevention and management are essential to combat this disease. This article may be useful to create awareness among the public, to prevent, manage and treat COVID-19.","Ali, Imran; Alharbi, Omar M.L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138861,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138861,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138861,01/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-01

3537,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: what obstetricians need to know,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019’s effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2–14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49–56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54–73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17–29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks’ gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).","Rasmussen, Sonja A.; Smulian, John C.; Lednicky, John A.; Wen, Tony S.; Jamieson, Denise J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017,Elsevier,MA ID 2604381070,24/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-24

3540,An efficient pattern growth approach for mining fault tolerant frequent itemsets,"Abstract Mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining exact matching frequent itemsets. Previous algorithms mine FT frequent itemsets using Apriori heuristic. Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.","Bashir, Shariq",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
3541,Effect of pollutant source location on air pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building,"Abstract This article investigates the dispersion of airborne pollutants emitted from different locations near a high-rise building. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design.","Keshavarzian, Erfan; Jin, Ruizhi; Dong, Kejun; Kwok, Kenny C.S.; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

3543,Urban inequalities in the 21st century economy,"Abstract In the last decade or so, inequality studies have assumed renewed prominence across the social sciences. In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.","Nijman, Jan; Wei, Yehua Dennis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

For sustained production of animals products, healthy livestock and poultry farming are the major concerns as animals are susceptible to various infectious agents viz. bacteria, virus, and parasites leading to huge economical losses in the form of livestock’s morbidity and mortality. Besides, zoonotic nature of some infectious pathogens of animals is also raising concern for human safety. Vaccination of animals against various diseases present in different geographical regions is a best known strategy for prevention of different disease outbreaks both in organized and unorganized livestock and poultry sectors. Vaccines had played a major role in eradication of different dreaded diseases of livestock sectors globally. In this article we have discussed different vaccine types, various vaccine strategies used for the development of more efficacious and safe vaccines and commercially available vaccines for livestock and poultry.","Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi; Gupta, Vikas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Public spaces and transport are noticeably quieter and many workplaces are getting emptier as staff members work from home. The Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns are hitting businesses hard. And as workforces move to remote working, IT departments are under pressure. At the same time, cyber criminals are exploiting the pandemic, with rises in phishing and other forms of attacks. The cyber security workforce, already suffering a skills crisis, may lack the soft skills required to effectively tackle these issues, many of which could be solved if the industry didn't rely so heavily on recruiting graduates and rather looked towards hiring apprentices, argues Phil Chapman of Firebrand Training.","Chapman, Phil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1353-4858(20)30042-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1353-4858(20)30042-8,Elsevier,10.1016/s1353-4858(20)30042-8,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3554,Chapter 16 Dengue Virus,"Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It is a single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus with 10,700 bases. The genus Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50–200 million people annually, putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20,000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement, and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype, but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development, developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence, the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.","Murugesan, Amudhan; Manoharan, Mythreyee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3555,Prudently conduct the engineering and synthesis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 that has been sweeping the world, scientists reconstructed the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly using a synthetic genomics platform, in order to accelerate therapeutics and vaccine development. However, given the dual-use nature of this technology, there exists a high biosecurity risk. This paper points out the potential risks of the engineering SARS-CoV-2 virus and puts forward 6 questions to this work. The authors emphasize that the two basic values of safety/security and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly. From the perspective of responsible development of biotechnology, this paper calls for a careful assessment to the risks of the technology, replacing risky technologies with safe ones. The risks of publication also need to be strictly assessed. The authors believe, in addition to enhancing the “self-government” and self-discipline of scientists and scientific communities, government supervision must be reinforced, laws and regulations should be improved, and global regulation framework ought to be constructed.","Gao, Peng; Ma, Shiwen; Lu, Daru; Mitcham, Carl; Jing, Yijia; Wang, Guoyu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.synbio.2020.03.002,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178320/,PMC,10.1016/j.synbio.2020.03.002,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Extensive literature on the nutrition and physiology of GF rats and the expanding library of immunological reagents have increased the research utility of GF, GN, or DF rats. Such rats have been extensively used in metabolic experiments as nucleus seed stocks for the production of disease-free animals and as tools for infectious disease studies, among others. The chapter also presents research applications of GF rats that are particularly suitable for testing candidate viral carcinogens since they are uniquely free of all known viruses, for pathology studies in the distinguishing of primary mediation lesions from those associated with infections, and the study of the biological effects of radiation.","Carter, Philip B.; Norin, Elisabeth; Swennes, Alton G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3560,Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study,"Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

3561,"Trump’s “America first” energy policy, contingency and the reconfiguration of the global energy order","Abstract The global energy system is in transition to a new energy order characterized by the emergence of the United States as a net oil exporter, the shale revolution and the gradual shift towards low-carbon sources and renewables. The shale boom in the US was a game changer, as was the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trump pushed an ambitious “America first” agenda aimed at transforming the US into a global energy superpower. The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, it outlines the key pillars of the emerging global energy order. Second, it underscores the role of contingent events, a factor neglected by some previous studies because of their reliance on what A.O.Hirschman (1970) termed “paradigmatic thinking”. The recent transition in the international energy order is an outcome of two paramount, yet largely unanticipated events: the shale revolution in the US and Trump’s neomercantilist and unilateralist economic policies. While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these developments for global energy governance.","Guliyev, Farid",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,Elsevier,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

3566,Responding to health emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region in times of conflict,"WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history. There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries.1 , 2 The region's 680 million people3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees.5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.

3568,Chapter 1 Sialic acid and biology of life: An introduction,"Abstract Sialic acids are important molecule with high structural diversity. They are known to occur in higher animals such as Echinoderms, Hemichordata, Cephalochorda, and Vertebrata and also in other animals such as Platyhelminthes, Cephalopoda, and Crustaceae. Plants are known to lack sialic acid. But they are reported to occur in viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Deaminated neuraminic acid although occurs in vertebrates and bacteria, is reported to occur in abundance in the lower vertebrates. Sialic acids are mostly located in terminal ends of glycoproteins and glycolipids, capsular and tissue polysialic acids, bacterial lipooligosaccharides/polysaccharides, and in different forms that dictate their role in biology. Sialic acid play important roles in human physiology of cell-cell interaction, communication, cell-cell signaling, carbohydrate-protein interactions, cellular aggregation, development processes, immune reactions, reproduction, and in neurobiology and human diseases in enabling the infection process by bacteria and virus, tumor growth and metastasis, microbiome biology, and pathology. It enables molecular mimicry in pathogens that allows them to escape host immune responses. Recently sialic acid has found role in therapeutics.

3570,Prevalence of comorbidities in the novel Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background An outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID -19) in Wuhan, China, the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. Aims The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results Eight studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 ± 3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67 ± 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 ± 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30 ± 4, 95% CI 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17 ± 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 ± 6, 95% CI 6-11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 ± 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2 ± 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. Conclusion We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and found underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular, may be a risk factor for severe patients compared with Non-severe patients.","Yang, Jing; Zheng, Ya; Gou, Xi; Pu, Ke; Chen, Zhaofeng; Guo, Qinghong; Ji, Rui; Wang, Haojia; Wang, Yuping; Zhou, Yongning",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12
3571,On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Tang, Xiaolu; Wu, Changcheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Yuhe; Yao, Xinmin; Wu, Xinkai; Duan, Yuange; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yirong; Qian, Zhaohui; Cui, Jie; Lu, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107875/,PMC,MA ID 2377437096,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03

3573,"Estimation of COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France","Abstract At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.","Ceylan, Zeynep",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138817,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138817,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138817,10/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-10
3574,"Relationships between disaster nursing competence, anticipatory disaster stress and motivation for disaster engagement","Abstract Nurses are the largest group of healthcare providers and are often the first line responders to a disaster event. Nurses' disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement.

3579,46 How can biomarkers be used to differentiate between infection and non-infectious causes of inflammation?,"Abstract: Diagnosis of sepsis is based on recognition of systemic inflammation and organ failure in the context of an inciting infection. Since none of the diagnostic criteria are specific to sepsis, it is easy to confound sepsis with noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism amongst others. Two widely used biomarkers, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have proven promising in sepsis diagnosis. Each has found varying success in the clinical context, with some centers relying heavily on these markers and others eschewing their use almost entirely. In this chapter, we present the evidence for their use in the diagnosis of sepsis and management of antibiotic therapy in the intensive care unit context.","Binnie, Alexandra; Lage, Joel; Dos Santos, Claudia C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Methods The first-visit patients seeking emergency dental services before or at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic were retrieved. Their demographic characteristics and the reasons for visiting were recorded and analyzed. Results There were 2,537 patients involved in this study. Thirty-eight percent fewer patients visited the dental urgency at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic than before. The distribution of dental problems has changed significantly. The proportion of dental and oral infection raised from 51.0% of pre-COVID-19 to 71.9% during COVID-19, and dental trauma decreased from 14.2% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, the non-urgency cases reduced to three-tenths of pre-COVID-19. Conclusion Within the limitation of this study, the COVID-19 epidemic had a strong influence on the utilization of emergency dental services.","Guo, Huaqiu; Zhou, Yin; Liu, Xiaoqiang; Tan, Jianguo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.02.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.02.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jds.2020.02.002,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16
3583,Chapter 6 Involvement and Roles of Long Noncoding RNAs in the Molecular Mechanisms of Emerging and Reemerging Viral Infections,"Abstract The studies on the mechanisms of viral–host interactions in infections have been focusing on protein-coding sequences of the genome. Although it is essential to consider the nonprotein-coding part that represents approximately 80% of the human genome. Thus advances in sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of thousands of RNAs with low or no capacity to encode proteins but are exhibiting crucial biological functions. Long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of these ncRNAs that are longer than 200nt. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the involvement of these molecules in development and physiological processes, especially through their regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are encoded in mammalian cells as well as in microorganisms and viruses. Several studies have found differential expressions of lncRNAs in response to viral infection of emerging viruses, which suggest important roles. In fact, they are involved in promoting viral replication, evading host immunity and regulating the host response to the infection. In addition, lncRNAs do not induce immune response compared to viral proteins; thus viruses might employ them as an effective strategy to invade their hosts. In this chapter, we discuss particularly the emerging virus–host interaction associated lncRNAs through addressing their involvement in the mechanisms underlying emerging viral infections as well as in the pathways of immune system in response to these infections. We also discuss the promising role of these noncoding transcripts as biomarkers for diagnosing viral pathologies.","Lamsisi, Maryame; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Se presentan los casos de dos niñas de 14 y 12 años que acudieron a urgencias: la primera con oftalmoplejía internuclear y la segunda con pérdida de visión y cefalea. No presentaban otra focalidad neurológica. En la imagen de resonancia magnética se evidenciaron placas hiperintensas en ambas, sugerentes de cuadro desmielinizante. Al mes, los síntomas neuroftalmológicos se resolvieron y las resonancias magnéticas de control fueron normales. El diagnóstico fue encefalitis diseminada aguda secundaria a M. pneumoniae. El diagnóstico se hace por PCR (gold standard) y/o IgM en serología. Es importante pensar en esta posible etiología ante casos sugerentes de enfermedad desmielinizante. Existe controversia sobre el papel de los antibióticos y si se contemplan los corticoides. Como conclusión, M. pneumoniae debe ser diagnóstico diferencial en afectaciones neuroftalmológicas agudas en niños. Abstract The purpose of this article is to describe two paediatric neuro-ophthalmological clinical cases caused by a systemic infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible aetiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated.

3591,Role of pattern recognition receptors and interferon-beta in protecting bat cell lines from encephalomyocarditis virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infection,"Abstract Bats are potential natural hosts of Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Bats appear to have some unique features in their innate immune system that inhibit viral replication causing limited clinical symptoms, and thus, contributing to the virus spill over to humans. Here, kidney epithelial cell lines derived from four bat species (Pteropus dasymallus, Rousettus leschenaultii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and Miniopterus fuliginosus) and two non-bat species (Homo sapiens and Mesocricetus auratus) were infected with EMCV and JEV. The replication of EMCV and JEV was lower in the bat cell lines derived from R. leschenaultii, R. ferrumequinum, and M. fuliginosus with a higher expression level of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5) and interferon-beta (IFN-β) than that in the non-bat cell lines and a bat cell line derived from P. dasymallus. The knockdown of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in Rhinolophus bat cell line using antisense RNA oligonucleotide led to decrease IFN-β expression and increased viral replication. These results suggest that TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 are important for antiviral response against EMCV and JEV in Rhinolophus bats.","Tarigan, Ronald; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Doysabas, Karla Cristine C.; Ken, Maeda; Iida, Atsuo; Hondo, Eiichi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.060,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.060,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.060,18/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-18
3592,Respiratory conditions in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Important considerations regarding novel treatment strategies to reduce mortality,"Abstract A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases. ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure. There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed. Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop. At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19. Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments. It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.","Geier, Mark R.; Geier, David A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109760,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109760,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109760,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

This case report discusses the relevant imaging findings of one of the first cases in the mid-western United States. It involves a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, dyspnea, and cough for 1 week and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. The utility of the noncontrast CT chest in the diagnosis of COVID-19 has been controversial, but there are specific imaging findings that have been increasingly associated with this virus in the appropriate clinical context.

3599,Chapter 2 Molecular basis of genetic variation of viruses error-prone replication,"Abstract Genetic variation is a necessity of all biological systems. Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate. A distinction is made between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant mutation and recombination.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Considerable effort has been invested in the development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly, and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction device. We demonstrated the system’s capability by amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the dengue fever virus. The resulting data were then automatically uploaded via a Bluetooth interface to an Android-based smartphone and then wirelessly sent to a global network, instantly making the test results available anywhere in the world. The IoT system presented here could become an essential tool for healthcare centers to tackle infectious disease outbreaks identified either by DNA or ribonucleic acid.","Zhu, Hanliang; Podesva, Pavel; Liu, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Haoqing; Teply, Tomas; Xu, Ying; Chang, Honglong; Qian, Airong; Lei, Yingfeng; Li, Yu; Niculescu, Andreea; Iliescu, Ciprian; Neuzil, Pavel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,Elsevier,10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,15/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-15

3605,Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?,"Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Chiew, Calvin J; Lee, Vernon J",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30129-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30129-8,Elsevier,MA ID 3006642361,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
3606,The building of social resilience in Sichuan after the Wenchuan earthquake: A perspective of the socio-government interactions,"Abstract In November 2007, China implemented its Emergency Response Law to ensure national unified leadership and collaboration when responding to emergencies. In recent years, China’s main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China’s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China’s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China’s disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform.","Wang, Chun-yuan; Guo, Jinyun; Kuo, Ming-feng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
3607,"Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Abstract Meteorological parameters are the important factors influencing the infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. This study aims to explore the association between Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and weather parameters. In this study, we collected the daily death numbers of COVID-19, meteorological parameters and air pollutant data from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan, China. Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [−7.50% (95% CI: −10.99%, −3.88%) and −11.41% (95% CI: −19.68%, −2.29%)]. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.","Ma, Yueling; Zhao, Yadong; Liu, Jiangtao; He, Xiaotao; Wang, Bo; Fu, Shihua; Yan, Jun; Niu, Jingping; Zhou, Ji; Luo, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138226,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138226,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138226,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01

3609,Chapter 19 Disease resistance for different livestock species,"Abstract This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was discussed.","Pal, Aruna; Chakravarty, A.K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3611,20 Infection Prevention and Control in the Tropics,"Abstract Tropical settings present unique challenges to the practice of infection prevention and control. These are multi-faceted due to differences in the climate, culture, social, and political milieu of low- and middle-income countries situated in the tropics, as well as the lack of resources. The emergence of communicable diseases and low vaccination coverage also lead to nosocomial augmentation of community outbreaks, further increasing the economic burden of hospital management. Addressing these challenges requires innovative, low-cost, and tailored solutions suited to the tropical environment.","Shakoor, Sadia; Warraich, Haider J.; Zaidi, Anita K.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3612,Chapter 8 The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: An Emerging Virus of Global Threat,"Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region. In this chapter, we outline the prevailing information regarding the emergence and epidemiology of this virus, its mode of transmission and pathogenicity, its clinical features, and the potential strategies for prevention.","Khan, Gulfaraz; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

An effective agreement should be viewed as an opportunity for nations to proactively transition towards sustainable and equitable fisheries and pave the path for other SDGs. Supporting fishers does not require harmful subsidies, and we provide evidence-based options for reform that highlight equity needs while reducing environmental harm. Subsidy reforms need clear goals, co-design, transparency, and fair implementation. An agreement on SDG 14.6 could be a turning point for the oceans and for the well-being of those that depend on the oceans for livelihoods and nutrition. Responsible seafood production will require international cooperation not only at WTO, but among governments, fisher organizations, civil society, and the wider public.","Cisneros-Montemayor, Andrés M.; Ota, Yoshitaka; Bailey, Megan; Hicks, Christina C.; Khan, Ahmed S.; Rogers, Anthony; Sumaila, U.

3623,Engineered Human Cathelicidin Antimicrobial Peptides Inhibit Ebola Virus Infection,"Summary The 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak coupled with the most recent outbreaks in Central Africa underscore the need to develop effective treatment strategies against EBOV. Although several therapeutic options have shown great potential, developing a wider breadth of countermeasures would increase our efforts to combat the highly lethal EBOV. Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most likely owing to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify AMPs as a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering AMPs for improved therapeutic efficacy.","Yu, Yangsheng; Cooper, Christopher L.; Wang, Guangshun; Morwitzer, M.

3625,Clinical features and dynamics of viral load in imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Objectives To compare the clinical characteristics and the dynamics of viral load between the imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19. Design and methods Data from 51 laboratory-confirmed patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results The incubation period in the tertiary group was longer than that in the imported and secondary groups (both P < 0.05). Fever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and half of the patients had a low-grade temperature (<38.0℃) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). The CT scan showed that most patients had bilateral pneumonia in the three groups (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively). Ct values detected from the tertiary patients were similar to those from the imported and secondary groups at the time of admission (both P > 0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable for half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7, and all patients on day 14. For 1/3rd of the patients in the imported and secondary groups, the viral load remained positive on day 14 after the admission. Conclusions COVID-19 can present as pneumonia with less onset of symptoms, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease in the tertiary patients.","Xu, Tianmin; Chen, Cong; Zhu, Zhen; Cui, Manman; Chen, Chunhua; Dai, Hong; Xue, Yuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14
3626,Interleukin-17 suppresses grass carp reovirus infection in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells by activating NF-κB signaling,"Abstract The grass carp accounts for a large proportion of aquacultural production in China, but the hemorrhagic disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection often causes huge economic losses to the industry. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-κB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-IκBα in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-κB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 acted as immune cytokines, exerting an antiviral effect by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhang, Yunshan; Zhang, Xing; Liang, Zi; Dai, Kun; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Mingtian; Pan, Jun; Xue, Renyu; Cao, Guangli; Tang, Jian; Song, Xuehong; Hu, Xiaolong; Gong, Chengliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,Elsevier,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
3627,Antimicrobial resistant and extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli isolated from fecal samples of African dromedary camels,"Abstract This study was conducted to determine the distribution of antimicrobial resistance among Escherichia coli isolated from feces of healthy dromedary camels in Kenya. A total of 162 fecal samples were cultivated for E. coli. Samples were also subcultivated to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study. The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL producing E. coli was 0.6%. PCR and amplicon sequencing showed that the ESBL producer belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group A, sequence type (ST) 48, and harbored bla CTX-M-15. None of the isolates contained mcr genes. The results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of AMR E. coli, including ESBL producers, that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.","Nüesch-Inderbinen, Magdalena; Kindle, Patrick; Baschera, Melinda; Liljander, Anne; Jores, Jörg; Corman, Victor Max; Stephan, Roger",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
3628,Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases,"Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure–function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure–function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug discovery process. Computational tools offer the advantage of delivering new drug candidates more quickly and at a lower cost. Various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of the virus inside the host are discussed in this chapter such as viral polymerase, helicase, protease, etc. Various antiviral drug molecules identified and designed on the basis of the structure of viral proteins which are highlighted, and disclosed details of the available inhibitors and potential antiviral are discussed.

3632,The signal peptide as a new target for drug design,"Abstract Many current and potential drug targets are membrane-bound or secreted proteins that are expressed and transported via the Sec61 secretory pathway. They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins. The SP may thus become a validated target for designing drugs for numerous disorders, including certain hereditary diseases.","Lumangtad, Liezel A.; Bell, Thomas W.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,15/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-15

In this crisis, what role can companies play? Public and private companies must continue to produce or provide their services, but with consideration of the health context. Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization. Helped by their occupational practitioners, healthcare advisers, and safety professionals, companies that have a financial capacity and responsibilities (including governmental, federal, or state administrations) will thus have to prepare their business continuity planning for when cases of infected patients occur in the company. They also must be prepared for the potential psychosocial and psychological effects of outbreaks.

3634,"Chapter 15 Analysis of alkaloids (indole alkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids, tropane alkaloids)","Abstract Alkaloids are a large cluster of molecules found in Mother Nature all over the world. They are all secondary compounds and collection of miscellaneous elements and biomolecules, derived from amino acids or from transamination. This diverse chemical group is categorized, based on the amino acids that deliver their nitrogen atom and part of their skeleton. Alkaloids from a similar origin or having the same basic nucleus may have dissimilar biosynthetic pathways and different biological activity. They are derived from l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, anthranilic acid or acetate, l-histidine, l-ornithine, nicotinic acid, and l-lysine. Apart from other types of alkaloids, indole, tropane, and isoquinoline alkaloids are very important. People from all over the world are using them in their everyday life. Alkaloids can also have an animal origin, which may be endogenous or exogenous. This chapter highlights the phytochemistry of the main representatives among the diverse group of alkaloids. This chapter also focuses on their extraction, purification, fractionation, identification, and quantification procedures. A fundamental understanding of the biological activity of important alkaloids is also highlighted in this chapter. With the potential of revealing new compounds and diverse pharmacological properties, alkaloids still embrace a great potential for the future of drug discovery.","Dey, Prasanta; Kundu, Amit; Kumar, Anoop; Gupta, Meenakshi; Lee, Byung Mu; Bhakta, Tejendra; Dash, Suvakanta; Kim, Hyung Sik",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020.

3642,A strategy to prevent future pandemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak,"A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world. At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.","Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J.; Li, Hongying",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003,CZI,MA ID 3004767366,2020,NA,NA,2020
3643,Chapter 8 Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control,"Abstract Medical interventions to prevent and treat viral disease constitute evolutionary forces that may modify the genetic composition of viral populations that replicate in an infected host and influence the genomic composition of those viruses that are transmitted and progress at the epidemiological level. Given the adaptive potential of viruses in general and the RNA viruses in particular, the selection of viral mutants that display some degree of resistance to inhibitors or vaccines is a tangible challenge. Mutant selection may jeopardize control of the viral disease. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics explained in the preceding chapters. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines, and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. It also follows that sociopolitical action to interrupt virus replication and spread as soon as possible is as important as scientifically sound treatment designs to control viral disease on a global scale.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Methods We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. Results Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively. Conclusions Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir using. More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these points.","Liu, Fang; Xu, Aifang; Zhang, Yan; Xuan, Weiling; Yan, Tingbo; Pan, Kenv; Yu, Wenyan; Zhang, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.013,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12
3645,Chapter 40 Waterborne Transmission of Enteric Viruses and Their Impact on Public Health,"Abstract Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.","Bouseettine, Rihab; Hassou, Najwa; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

This Perspective argues for transforming sustainability science into a transdisciplinary enterprise that can generate positive social and environmental change globally. In such transformation, the social sciences, humanities, and the arts can play an important role to address the complex problems of culture, institutions, and human behavior. To realize a truly integrated sustainability science, we need renewed research and public policies that reshape the research ecosystem of universities, funding agencies, science communications, policymaking, and decision making.

3649,Chinese experts’ consensus on the Internet of Things-aided diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the “COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)” based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the “cloud” through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to enable different levels of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment among different doctors from different hospitals to upgrade to the national and international through the intelligent assistance of the nCapp system. In this way, we can block disease transmission, avoid physician infection, and epidemic prevention and control as soon as possible.","Bai, Li; Yang, Dawei; Wang, Xun; Tong, Lin; Zhu, Xiaodan; Zhong, Nanshan; Bai, Chunxue; Powell, Charles A.; Chen, Rongchang; Zhou, Jian; Song, Yuanlin; Zhou, Xin; Zhu, Huili; Han, Baohui; Li, Qiang; Shi, Guochao; Li, Shengqing; Wang, Changhui; Qiu, Zhongmin; Zhang, Yong; Xu, Yu; Liu, Jie; Zhang, Ding; Wu, Chaomin; Li, Jing; Yu, Jinming; Wang, Jiwei; Dong, Chunling; Wang, Yaoli; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Lichuan; Zhang, Min; Ma, Xia; Zhao, Lin; Yu, Wencheng; Xu, Tao; Jin, Yang; Wang, Xiongbiao; Wang, Yuehong; Jiang, Yan; Chen, Hong; Xiao, Kui; Zhang, Xiaoju; Song, Zhenju; Zhang, Ziqiang; Wu, Xueling; Sun, Jiayuan; Shen, Yao; Ye, Maosong; Tu, Chunlin; Jiang, Jinjun; Yu, Hai; Tan, Fei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3650,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.","Ennaji, Youssef; Khataby, Khadija; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3651,Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted. Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health.3 , 4 Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness.3 , 5 Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak.","Wang, Guanghai; Zhang, Yunting; Zhao, Jin; Zhang, Jun; Jiang, Fan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30547-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30547-x,Elsevier,MA ID 1968779433,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04

3654,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may be harmful in patients with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient’s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

3657,13 Nanomaterial-based sensors,"Abstract This chapter deals with the advancement of nanomaterial-based sensors in the last 10 years. The use of different types of nanomaterials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metallic nanoparticles, was described, highlighting that graphene represents a rising star in the plethora of nanomaterials. Among the different transducers, the chapter describes the electrochemical and optical (bio)sensors, being the most promising devices. The use of materials at the nanodimension scale provides several improvements in terms of analytical features including sensitivity, rapidity of response, selectivity, and robustness, demonstrating the huge advantage of using the nanomaterials over the micromaterials in the development of smart and high-performant analytical tools.","Arduini, Fabiana; Cinti, Stefano; Scognamiglio, Viviana; Moscone, Danila",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3659,Editorial 58(1),"As I write, the world is gripped by news of a novel coronavirus sweeping across the planet. The epidemic is causing terrible anguish to many thousands of families and astounding economic damage in Asia. Whilst yet unconfirmed, several research results now point at the hunting, trade and consumption of pangolins as a likely source of the epidemic. Whether or not pangolins do finally prove to be at the origin of this particular virus, the research highlights that the possibility is very real. This may turn out to be a turning point for pangolin conservation, perhaps for the conservation of a great many other species. In 2015, the IUCN Species Survival Commission Pangolin Specialist Group reported concerns that the profound decline in Asian pangolins would lead to traffickers procuring supplies from Africa. The next five years saw their predictions largely fulfilled. Robust results from a range of research approaches showed first an increase in trade and value of pangolins within the West and central Africa and, more recently, growing international trafficking, with China and Vietnam as major destinations. In 2016, the CITES 17th Conference of Parties moved all African pangolin species onto Appendix 1. Not a single research paper published on pangolins in the past 5 years has suggested anything other than desperate jeopardy for all eight of the world’s species. All available researches point to increasing harvesting, with the rise ultimately driven by trade for profit. The plight of over‐hunted pangolins has become a rallying call for conservation over the past few years. New NGO and government funding initiatives have arisen, dedicated to research for their conservation. The dramatically steep decline of the Asian species has been written about in both Science and Nature, the most widely read scientific journals of the day, in the last few years. The pangolin, alongside the elephant, is a poster species for action against the illegal wildlife trade. However, the research community’s awareness of the impending doom has not in the least stemmed the trade. This issue contains a Short Communication reporting for the first time trade in pangolins in yet another country, South Sudan. I am unsure of what the public response to the possibility that pangolins can transmit deadly viruses will be. I hope it is to leave them alone, rather than to try to eradicate them. This Journal remains committed to improving knowledge of the African ecosystems and increasingly to reporting research that shows how they are changing in the face of our actions. This issue, as each issue, makes a new and relevant contribution to that objective.","Abernethy, Katharine",https://www.doi.org/10.1111/aje.12732,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159446/,PMC,MA ID 3000618339,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03
3660,Globalization of Communicable Diseases,"Abstract Fueled by globalization and human behavior, communicable diseases pose a serious threat to humankind despite unparalleled technological advances. New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location—where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries, global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.","Oppong, Joseph R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Today, expert personnel and centralized laboratories are needed to afford much time in diagnosing diseases caused from pathogens. Recent progress in electrochemical studies shows that biosensors are very simple, accurate, precise, and cheap at virus detection, for which researchers find great interest in this field. The clinical levels of these pathogens can be easily analyzed with proposed biosensors. Their working principle is based on affinity between antibody and antigen in body fluids. The progress still continues on these biosensors for accurate, rapid, reliable sensors in future.","Kaya, Sariye Irem; Karadurmus, Leyla; Ozcelikay, Goksu; Bakirhan, Nurgul K.; Ozkan, Sibel A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3662,Numerical investigation of gaseous pollutant cross-transmission for single-sided natural ventilation driven by buoyancy and wind,"Abstract Single-sided natural ventilation was numerically investigated to determine the impact of buoyancy and wind on the cross-transmission of pollution by considering six window types commonly found in multistory buildings. The goal of this study was to predict the gaseous pollutant transmission using computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and baseline k-ω turbulence equations. The results indicated that ventilation rates generally increased with increasing wind speeds if the effects of buoyancy and wind were not suppressed; however, the re-entry ratio representing the proportion of expelled air re-entering other floors and the corresponding risk of infection decreased. If the source of the virus was on a central floor, the risk of infection was the highest on the floors closest to the source. Different window types were also considered for determining their effectiveness in controlling cross-transmission and infection risk, depending on the source location and driving force (e.g., buoyancy and wind).","Wang, Jihong; Huo, Qiannan; Zhang, Tengfei; Wang, Shugang; Battaglia, Francine",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,Elsevier,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3665,Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety,"Abstract With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS–CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Wang, Lunan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003,Elsevier,MA ID 2892593968,21/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-21

3667,"Chapter 40 The Role of Innate Immunity in Regulating Rotavirus Replication, Pathogenesis, and Host Range Restriction and the Implications for Live Rotaviral Vaccine Development","Abstract Rotaviruses (RVs) are important causative agents of viral gastroenteritis in the young of most mammalian species studied, including humans, in which they are the most important cause of severe gastroenteritis worldwide despite the availability of several safe and effective vaccines. Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains. In this chapter, we review prevalent models of RV interactions with innate immune factors, viral strategies employed to regulate their function, and the implications of these findings for improved RV vaccine development.","Sen, Adrish; Ding, Siyuan; Greenberg, Harry B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3670,Specificity in PDZ-peptide interaction networks: Computational analysis and review,"Abstract Globular PDZ domains typically serve as protein–protein interaction modules that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions via recognition of short linear motifs (SLiMs). Often, PDZ mediated-interactions are essential components of macromolecular complexes, and disruption affects the entire scaffold. Due to their roles as linchpins in trafficking and signaling pathways, PDZ domains are attractive targets: both for controlling viral pathogens, which bind PDZ domains and hijack cellular machinery, as well as for developing therapies to combat human disease. However, successful therapeutic interventions that avoid off-target effects are a challenge, because each PDZ domain interacts with a number of cellular targets, and specific binding preferences can be difficult to decipher. Over twenty-five years of research has produced a wealth of data on the stereochemical preferences of individual PDZ proteins and their binding partners. Currently the field lacks a central repository for this information. Here, we provide this important resource and provide a manually curated, comprehensive list of the 271 human PDZ domains. We use individual domain, as well as recent genomic and proteomic, data in order to gain a holistic view of PDZ domains and interaction networks, arguing this knowledge is critical to optimize targeting selectivity and to benefit human health.","Amacher, Jeanine F.; Brooks, Lionel; Hampton, Thomas H.; Madden, Dean R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Vaccines for maternal immunization against RSV are in active development and could be implemented in the near future within existing maternal-child health platforms.

3672,"Positive rate of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4880 cases from one hospital in Wuhan, China, from Jan to Feb 2020","Abstract Background There’s an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection since December 2019, first in China, and currently with more than 80 thousand confirmed infection globally in 29 countries till March 2, 2020. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics.

3677,Identification of critical airports for controlling global infectious disease outbreaks: Stress-tests focusing in Europe,"Abstract As the global population increases and transportation connectivity improves in quality and prices, the demand for mobility increases, especially in long-haul services. According to the 2017 report of the European Commission in Mobility and Transport, the performance of all modes for passenger transport (roadways and airways) are reaching record highs. Although the benefits of the increased demand for mobility are substantial and welcome, an effort should be paid such as to ameliorate possible threatening side-effects that may also arise. As World Health Organization (WHO) denotes and as has been evident from the global COVID-19 epidemic outbreak, infectious diseases can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another under common exposure circumstances such as air transportation (especially long-haul airline connections) that may act as the medium for transmitting and spreading infectious diseases. In this paper, analytical and realistic models have been integrated, for providing evidence on the spread dynamics of infectious diseases that may face Europe through the airlines system. In particular, a detailed epidemiological model has been integrated with the airlines’ and land transport network, able to simulate the epidemic spread of infectious diseases originated from distant locations. Additionally, a wide set of experiments and simulations have been conducted, providing results from detailed stress-tests covering both mild as well as aggressive cases of epidemic spreading scenarios. The results provide convincing evidence on the effectiveness that the European airports' system offer in controlling the emergence of epidemics, but also on the time and extent that controlling measures should be taken in order to break the chain of infections in realistic cases.","Nikolaou, Paraskevas; Dimitriou, Loukas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2020.101819,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2020.101819,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jairtraman.2020.101819,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
3678,"Emerging infectious disease, the household built environment characteristics, and urban planning: Evidence on avian influenza in Vietnam","Abstract Recent concerns with pandemic outbreaks of human disease and their origins in animal populations have ignited concerns regarding connections between Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) and development. As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew & McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed “coherence indices” (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance.","Spencer, James H.; Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson M.; Saksena, Sumeet; Sultana, Nargis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,Elsevier,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31
3679,Care of patients with liver disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: EASL-ESCMID position paper,"Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an enormous challenge to healthcare systems in affected communities. Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course. It remains unclear at this point to what extent chronic liver diseases should be considered as risk factors, due to a shortage of appropriate studies. However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention. Thus, the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritise outpatient contacts, avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers, and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention.","Boettler, Tobias; Newsome, Philip N.; Mondelli, Mario U.; Maticic, Mojca; Cordero, Elisa; Cornberg, Markus; Berg, Thomas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

Genomic signatures can be at multiple levels of resolution depending on the questions being asked. (“Is this white powder anthrax?”; “Does this white powder match any of the anthrax samples taken from every laboratory in the United States that possesses anthrax?”) Multiple technologies exist to turn abstract genomic signatures into assays that can interrogate complex samples with varying degrees of speed, sensitivity, specificity, and cost.

3685,Applications of google search trends for risk communication in infectious disease management: A case study of COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan,"Abstract Objective An emerging outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected in at least 26 countries worldwide. Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan’ first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0), and Kaohsiung (lag0). Conclusion In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrated that GT could potentially define the proper timing and location for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies to the affected population.","Husnayain, Atina; Fuad, Anis; Su, Emily Chia-Yu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.021,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12
3686,"Mucoviscidosis: fisiopatología, genética, aspectos clínicos y terapéuticos","Resumen La mucoviscidosis es la enfermedad autosómica recesiva grave más frecuente que afecta a la población caucásica. En Francia, por ejemplo, la incidencia es de un caso por cada 4.500 nacimientos. Esta enfermedad se debe a mutaciones en el gen CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, regulador de conductancia transmembrana de la fibrosis quística), situado en el brazo largo del cromosoma 7, que codifica una proteína transmembrana implicada en la regulación del transporte transepitelial de iones cloruro (Cl–). En Francia, la mutación más frecuente (alrededor del 80% de los casos) es la deleción del aminoácido 508 (fenilalanina), denominada F508del. La ausencia o la disfunción de la proteína CFTR provoca un defecto en el transporte de Cl– y un aumento de la reabsorción de sal y agua, en particular en el epitelio bronquial, lo que conlleva una reducción del líquido de la superficie bronquial. Esta exocrinopatía generalizada conduce a la producción de «moco viscoso» (de ahí el nombre de mucoviscidosis), que obstruye varios sitios en el cuerpo, en particular el sistema respiratorio, el tracto digestivo y sus anexos (páncreas, vías biliares e hígado). La detección neonatal se ha generalizado desde 2002. La prueba del sudor es la prueba complementaria de referencia, validada por la identificación de dos mutaciones patógenas, para la confirmación del diagnóstico. El tratamiento es multidisciplinario. Se basa ante todo en la kinesiterapia respiratoria diaria y el tratamiento de las sobreinfecciones broncopulmonares, así como en las recomendaciones nutricionales con el uso de extractos pancreáticos. Es probable que el pronóstico, todavía muy desfavorable, se modifique con la llegada de terapias proteínicas o de edición de ácido ribonucleico o de gen.","Noël, S.; Sermet-Gaudelus, I.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,Elsevier,10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3690,Data on the stability of darunavir/cobicistat suspension after tablet manipulation,"The COVID-19 outbreak is now one of the most critical crises to manage for most of the national healthcare systems in the world. In the absence of authorised pharmacological treatments, many antiretrovirals, including darunavir/cobicistat fixed combination, are used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units. Therefore, their manipulation, even if it can strongly affect the product quality, is necessary for the preparation of suspension to meet patients’ need. In this situation, it is urgent to provide data and guidance to support hospital pharmacists and clinicians in their activity. The data in this article indicate that darunavir/cobicistat suspensions compounded by pharmacists using as active ingredient a commercially available tablet can be stable at least for one week.","Zanon, D.; Manca, A.; De Nicolò, A.; D'Avolio, A.; Musazzi, U.M.; Cilurzo, F.; Maximova, N.; Tomasello, C.; Minghetti, P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105552,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168728/,PMC,10.1016/j.dib.2020.105552,12/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-12
3691,Enhanced nano-aerosol loading performance of multilayer PVDF nanofiber electret filters,"Abstract Aerosol loading behavior of PVDF nanofiber electret filters using neutrally charged nano- and submicron aerosols was investigated experimentally for the first time. The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm−1, which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters. The multilayer PVDF electret filters have excellent filtration performance for long-term aerosol filtration and also great potential applications in the fields of personal health care and environmental protection.","Sun, Qiangqiang; Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,Elsevier,10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,01/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-01

Rapid advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology have revolutionized the development of highly lethal and reliable biological agents with enhanced virulence, survivability, and drug resistance. In the current scenario, construction and misuse of next generation synthetic agents is not mere science fiction, but has become a harsh reality. Next generation bioweapons are potential bio-threats to peace, security, and well-being of the targeted country.

Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.

3709,"Minimising the present and future plastic waste, energy and environmental footprints related to COVID-19","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had growing environmental consequences related to plastic use and follow-up waste, but more urgent health issues have far overshadowed the potential impacts. This paper gives a prospective outlook on how the disruption caused by COVID-19 can act as a catalyst for short-term and long-term changes in plastic waste management practices throughout the world. The impact of the pandemic and epidemic following through the life cycles of various plastic products, particularly those needed for personal protection and healthcare, is assessed. The energy and environmental footprints of these product systems have increased rapidly in response to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, while critical hazardous waste management issues are emerging due to the need to ensure destruction of residual pathogens in household and medical waste. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) is proposed to capture the environmental footprint of a plastic product throughout its entire life cycle. Emerging challenges in waste management during and after the pandemic are discussed from the perspective of novel research and environmental policies. The sudden shift in waste composition and quantity highlights the need for a dynamically reponsive waste management system.

3711,Pneumonia,"Abstract Pneumonia remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases in the world. The important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases especially in the elderly population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganisms. Because elderly individuals present with comorbidities, particular attention should be paid for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequently encountered pathogen. Enteric gram-negative rods, as well as anaerobes, should be considered in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Interventions for modifiable risk factors will reduce the risk of this infection. The adequacy of the initial antimicrobial therapy and determination of patients’ follow-up place is a key factor for prognosis. Also, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures. In this section it was focused on several aspects, including the atypical presentation of pneumonia in the elderly, the methods to evaluate the severity of illness, the appropriate take care place and the management with prevention strategies.","Banu, Buyukaydin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3713,"Higher tourism specialization, better hotel industry efficiency?","Abstract This study examines the effects of both specialization in tourism and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry. For this purpose, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) was employed to evaluate the efficiency of the hotel industry on a provincial level in China and to analyze how it is impacted by specialization in tourism and market competition. The results confirm that tourism specialization and market competition exert a synergistic effect on hotel industry efficiency in China. This study finds that tourism development as represented by a high level of tourism specialization by a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in hotels but does enhance the negative effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency. Significant policy and managerial implications stem from these findings.","Zhang, Dapeng; Tu, Jinghua; Zhou, Lingxu; Yu, Zhiyuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
3714,Chapter 4 Human Viruses: Emergence and Evolution,"Abstract Many new viruses have emerged in the last five decades. These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between human–animal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities. Vector-borne diseases also have a natural advantage of dissemination.","Sudhan, Shashi S.; Sharma, Preeti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3715,Chapter 30 Virus detection using nanosensors,"Abstract A smart city has a bright and sustainable way to integrate services together and can monitor/control them using intelligent devices called sensors to preserve the efficient utilization of resources. Sensors are distributed everywhere in smart cities. They can be employed to monitor health care, transportation, infrastructure, building, surveillance, government, etc. Especially, nanosensors hold great impact to turn the current techniques for the detection of viruses. With the facility of real-time sensing, there is no need for regular inspections for maintenance and surveying, which results in reduced costs and time wastage. Definitely, common sensing platforms need persistent updates to address increasing doubts in the detection of viruses as they modify quickly and spread from person to person, pointing the urgency of early detection. In this chapter the introduction is briefly described in Section 30.1. The fundamental of nanosensors is explained in Section 30.2. The significance and applications of nanosensors in virus detection are extensively discussed in Sections 30.3 and 30.4. Section 30.5 consists of various challenges and outlook.","Saylan, Yeşeren; Denizli, Adil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3716,Nonstructural protein 6 of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus induces autophagy to promote viral replication via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused, and continues to cause, severe economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host remain largely unknown. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PEDV replication in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells was investigated. The effects of the structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the autophagy process and the autophagy-related signaling pathways were also examined. The results shown that PEDV replication increased the autophagy flux in IPEC-J2 cells, and that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the enhanced virulence of PEDV in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs. When autophagy was pharmacologically induced by rapamycin, PEDV replication increased from 8.5 × 105 TCID50/mL to 8.8 × 106 TCID50/mL in IPEC-J2 cells. When autophagy was pharmacologically suppressed by hydroxychloroquine, PEDV replication decreased from 8.5 × 105 TCID50/mL to 7.9 × 104 TCID50/mL. To identify which PEDV proteins were the key inducers of autophagy, all 4 structural proteins and 17 nonstructural proteins of PEDV were eukaryotic expressed. It was found that the nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) and ORF3 of PEDV were able to induce significant autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells, but the other proteins were unable to induce autophagy. It was indicated that nsp6-induced autophagy mainly occurred via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The results accelerate the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.","Lin, Huixing; Li, Bin; Liu, Mingxing; Zhou, Hong; He, Kongwang; Fan, Hongjie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108684,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108684,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108684,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

3718,Chapter 27 Emergence and Reemergence of Viral Zoonotic Diseases: Concepts and Factors of Emerging and Reemerging Globalization of Health Threats,"Abstract The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02–1.04), length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% CI = 1.013–1.024), sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% CI = 1.778–2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.111–2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% CI = 1.152–5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered.

3725,Chapter 10 Bioaugmentation for the treatment of waterborne pathogen contamination water,"Abstract Bioaugmentation is an eco-friendly and economically viable approach for enhanced degradation of pollutants and pathogens by addition of pregrown microbe or microbial cocultures in the medium. Microorganisms from different ecological conditions and engineered microbes capable to produce versatile enzymes and bioproducts are added to native microbial population for in situ treatment of wastewater. Bacterial pathogen borne in wastewater is an important concern for public health because they are not only associated with environmental damage, morbidity, and mortality but also cause economic loss connected with physical and chemical methods in wastewater treatment. Bacteriophages are natural killer of bacteria; they can be used as an alternative, cost-effective, biological method for waterborne bacterial pathogen control. Legionella pneumophila is the most tracked waterborne pathogen requiring specific treatment conditions because despite of biocides use, they are able to persist in water supplies with the help of multispecies biofilms and phagocytic protists. This type of pathogens can be biologically controlled through native complex communities fight for nutrients by means of antagonistic molecules as war weapons. Bioinoculation of heterotrophic bacterial strains in different wastewater treatment systems improves the process of pathogenic bacteria removal. The antagonist substances produced by the inoculated strains are responsible for bacterial pathogen inactivation.","Singh, Manoj Kumar; Maurya, Anurag; Kumar, Sushil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3727,Chapter 2 Syndromic surveillance using web data: a systematic review,"Abstract During the recent years, a lot of debate is taken place about the evolution of Smart Healthcare systems. Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists. Finally, these new systems can help improve the standards of human life.","Samaras, Loukas; García-Barriocanal, Elena; Sicilia, Miguel-Angel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3732,Novel decoy cellular vaccine strategy utilizing transgenic antigen-expressing cells as immune presenter and adjuvant in vaccine prototype against SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Abstract A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called “I-cells”. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for “off-the-shelf” frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 are expressed on the surface of irradiated target I-cells. Utilizing this innovative strategy, these viral antigen-displaying decoy cells will be developed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease.","Ji, Henry; Yan, Ying; Ding, Beibei; Guo, Wenzhong; Brunswick, Mark; Niethammer, Andreas; SooHoo, Williams; Smith, Robin; Nahama, Alexis; Zhang, Yanliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3734,COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission: Are we asking the right questions?,"Abstract Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.","Heller, Léo; Mota, César R.; Greco, Dirceu B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138919,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138919,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138919,10/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-10

However, many other viral infections can also affect the liver ranging from mild asymptomatic elevations of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure. This article will provide a brief overview on a variety of different viral infections that may be associated with significant liver pathology at least under certain conditions, for example, immunosuppression. This overview discusses key virological features, clinical presentation of associated liver disease and provides some information on diagnosis and an outline of treatment options. Thus, the overview can provide first orientation when infectious hepatitis is encountered in a patient that cannot be explained by the usual hepatitis viruses.","Spengler, Ulrich",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3737,Mesenchymal stem cells and management of COVID-19 pneumonia,"Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. Governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread in mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact. The scale of the problem is massive. Here I consider new approaches to improve patient's biological resistance to COVID-19 using stem cells, and how benefit might be scaled and simplified using synthetic stem cells to meet logistical needs within a short time frame.","Metcalfe, Su M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
3738,"Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein","Summary The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","Walls, Alexandra C.; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M.

3739,Effects of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality in patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Background Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation treatment. Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition. Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections. Objective To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19. Methods In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days. During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment. Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality. Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. Results The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P < 0.001). Conclusion Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Kai; Chen, Ying; Wu, Duozhi; Lin, Ruzheng; Wang, Zaisheng; Pan, Liqing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101132,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101132,Elsevier,MA ID 2904096912,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

Among them, DNA sensors, with oligonucleotides as recognition elements, are being widely utilized for many applications, mainly diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this experiment, a hybridization-based genosensor was designed on a 100-nm sputtered gold film. This material worked as an immobilization and transduction surface for the electrochemical diagnosis of a specific DNA sequence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. The simplicity of the electrochemical instrumentation is combined with a selective methodology to detect the hybridization event enzymatically. This chapter explains all the necessary steps for the construction of the genosensor allowing a low detection limit for the chosen DNA sequence. Protocols for studying the influence of parameters affecting the methodology are given. This chapter also includes questions for students and indications for writing a lab report.","González-López, Andrea; Fernández Abedul, M.

The Earth is home to an estimated 10million species, of which a large chunk belongs to marine environment. Marine plants are a store house of a variety of antimicrobial compounds like classes of marine flavonoids—flavones and flavonols, terpenoids, alkaloids, peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, polyketides, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and steroids. Lot of research today is directed toward marine species, which have proved to be a potent source of structurally widely diverse and yet highly bioactive secondary metabolites. Varied species of phylum Porifera, algae including diatoms, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Dinoflagellata, Chrysophyta, cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta, bacteria, fungi, and weeds have been exploited by mankind for their inherent indigenous biological antimicrobial compounds, produced under the extreme stressful underwater conditions of temperature, atmospheric pressure, light, and nutrition.

3744,Topological data analysis to model the shape of immune responses during co-infections,"Abstract Co-infections by multiple pathogens have important implications in many aspects of health, epidemiology and evolution. However, how to disentangle the non-linear dynamics of the immune response when two infections take place at the same time is largely unexplored. Using data sets of the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection in mice, we employ here topological data analysis to simplify and visualise high dimensional data sets. We identified persistent shapes of the simplicial complexes of the data in the three infection scenarios: single viral infection, single bacterial infection, and co-infection. The immune response was found to be distinct for each of the infection scenarios and we uncovered that the immune response during the co-infection has three phases and two transition points. During the first phase, its dynamics is inherited from its response to the primary (viral) infection. The immune response has an early shift (few hours post co-infection) and then modulates its response to react against the secondary (bacterial) infection. Between 18 and 26 h post co-infection the nature of the immune response changes again and does no longer resembles either of the single infection scenarios.","Sasaki, Karin; Bruder, Dunja; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3747,Chest CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia by duration of symptoms,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate lung abnormalities on thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with COVID-19 and correlate findings to duration of symptoms. Methods In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0–4 days); stage-2 (5–9 days); stage-3 (10–14 days); stage-4 (15–21 days); stage-5 (22–28 days); and stage-6 (＞28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). Results The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8 ± 3.1, vs. 6.5 ± 4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 ± 4.1). Conclusion Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity. This disease changed rapidly at the early stage, then tended to be stable and lasted for a long time.","Ding, Xun; Xu, Jia; Zhou, Jun; Long, Qingyun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109009,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3750,The history of respiratory disease management,"Abstract Over the past 200 years lung diseases have shifted from infections – tuberculosis, pneumonia – to diseases of dirty air – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer. New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV infection, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, β2-adrenoceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to universal coverage in both primary and hospital care. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine. Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.","Geddes, Duncan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Despite the long history of wastewater research, comprehensive understanding of the role and behavior of HRPs during wastewater treatment is still limited owing to the complexity of the community. In recent decades, the rapid development of molecular tools, especially the wide application of next generation sequencing technologies, helps to unravel the community composition, structure, and dynamic variation in wastewater. Overall, this chapter mainly focuses on biological HRPs, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater. The characteristics, classification, fates, functions, and health implications of these HRPs are introduced in detail. Moreover, the biogeography of HRPs is a research hotspot in recent years, and available information is also summarized in this chapter. Finally, we also propose the future research needs of HRPs in wastewater after the comprehensive summary of the existing research reports.

IBV is well studied worldwide; nevertheless, in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. In spite of regular vaccination with Massachusetts (Mass) strain has been available to control IB for many decades in MENA regions, which it is most commonly used, the protection is not occurred. However, the continuity of the spread of IBV has shown the emergence of multiple variant strains due to the frequent point of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene hypervariable regions. All the reported IBV variants circulate in the form of several serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized by current vaccines. This emergence remains a problem for the poultry industry and vaccine manufacturers. Therefore the objective of this present chapter, which is reported for the first time, aims to establish phylogenic relationship among emerging strains in MENA regions.","Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3757,Quantitative computed tomography analysis for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Abstract Purpose To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = −0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (χ2 = 8.160, P = 0.004). Conclusions Our experiments demonstrated that the computer tool could reliably and accurately assess the severity and distribution of pneumonia on CT scans.","Shen, Cong; Yu, Nan; Cai, Shubo; Zhou, Jie; Sheng, Jiexin; Liu, Kang; Zhou, Heping; Guo, Youmin; Niu, Gang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004,Elsevier,MA ID 2970191042,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06

Interdisciplinarity evolved in the 20th century in response to the institutionalization and segmentation of academic research and major transitions in society. Many geography departments have interdisciplinary profiles, but the daily practice of interdisciplinarity depends on the networks of individual academics. The results of interdisciplinary collaboration include research books, textbooks, and journal articles, the market of which continues to diversify. Authors of interdisciplinary textbooks and teachers of interdisciplinary classes must pay special attention to teaching philosophy and communication skills in order to satisfy the needs of a heterogeneous body of students interested in interdisciplinary learning. Interdisciplinarity means different things in different contexts, and practices and challenges vary. Some see interdisciplinarity as an exciting opportunity, while others feel threatened by the downsides of crossing disciplinary boundaries.","Raento, Pauliina",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3765,Chapter 7 Scientific Advances in the Diagnosis of Emerging and Reemerging Viral Human Pathogens,"Abstract Despite scientific advances, the diagnosis of infectious diseases is primarily possible through vaccination and later by antibiotics. Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host–parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.","Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3766,Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: A retrospective cohort study,"Summary Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5–21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients’ nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0·05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). Conclusion In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.","Deng, Lisi; Li, Chunna; Zeng, Qi; Liu, Xi; Li, Xinghua; Zhang, Haitang; Hong, Zhongsi; Xia, Jinyu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11
3767,The effect of China's open-door tourism policy on Taiwan: Promoting or suppressing tourism from other countries to Taiwan?,"Abstract This study employs an extended gravity model to analyse the complementarity or competitiveness relationship of the number of inbound tourists and corresponding tourism revenue between China and 19 other nations under the implementation of China's Open-door Tourism Policy to Taiwan in 2008. A simulation for 2018–2021 demonstrates the sustained impact of this policy. The results show that the number of tourists to Taiwan from China reached its peak in 2015 at 41% and will decrease to 9% by 2021. The corresponding tourism revenue will decrease from 49% to 11% over the same period. The results also show that if the number of tourists from China remains above 836,772, the number of tourists from Japan, Hong Kong, Australasia, North America, and Europe will still increase. However, the number of tourists from South Korea and South and Southeast Asia will increase continuously regardless of tourists from China, even far below 836,772.","Liou, Je-Liang; Hsu, Pei-Chun; Wu, Pei-Ing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3769,99mTc-radiolabeled Levofloxacin and micelles as infection and inflammation imaging agents,"Abstract Easy and early detection of infection and inflammation is essential for early and effective treatment. In this study, PEGylated micelles were designed and both micelles and Levofloxacin were radiolabeled with 99mTcO4 - to develop potential radiotracers for detection of infection/inflammation. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles were compared. The aim of this study is to formulate and compare 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles as infection and inflammation agents having different mechanisms for the accumulation at infection and inflammation site. PEGylated micelles were designed with a particle size of 80 ± 0.7 nm and proper characterization properties. High radiolabeling efficiency was achieved for 99mTc-Levofloxacin (96%) and 99mTc-micelles (87%). The radiolabeling efficiency was remained stable with some insignificant alterations for both radiotracers at 25 °C for 24 h. Although in vitro bacterial binding of 99mTc-levofloxacine was higher than 99mTc-micelles, 99mTc-micelles may also be evaluated potential agent due to long circulation and passive accumulation mechanisms at infection/inflammation site. Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view.","Silindir-Gunay, Mine; Ozer, Asuman Yekta",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3773,The effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemics in the final phase of the current outbreak in China,"Abstract Objectives Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. Methods Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. Results Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Conclusions The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.","Tang, Biao; Xia, Fan; Tang, Sanyi; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Li, Qian; Sun, Xiaodan; Liang, Juhua; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.018,17/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-17
3774,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We have read with great interest the Correspondence by Shibo Jiang and colleagues,1 in which they propose a name change for the newly emerged coronavirus,2 which was recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.3 The authors argued that the use of SARS in the virus name could confuse the public about the disease that it causes; in addition, they noted that the name SARS-CoV-2 is not consistent with the disease name chosen by WHO, coronavirus disease 2019. The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate. To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established standardised formats for classifying viruses. Under these rules, a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on phylogeny and taxonomy.4 Through DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses,5 the newly emerged coronavirus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to SARS-CoV, the primary viral isolate defining the species. The SARS-CoV species includes viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV_PC4-227, and SARSr-CoV-btKY72. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of this viral species. The use of SARS in naming SARS-CoV-2 does not derive from the name of the SARS disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species. The use of SARS for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species, SARS-CoV. In other words, viruses in this species can be named SARS regardless of whether or not they cause SARS-like diseases.","Wu, Yuntao; Ho, Wenzhe; Huang, Yaowei; Jin, Dong-Yan; Li, Shiyue; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liu, Xuefeng; Qiu, Jianming; Sang, Yongming; Wang, Qiuhong; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30557-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30557-2,Elsevier,MA ID 2047323912,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06

Even after Pasteur's rabies vaccine discovery, globally people continue to be stricken with it today. History has carried along the myths and legends that surround this diabolical virus. Some still believe that rabies treatment requires 20 or more shots to the stomach by some monstrously long needle. However, today's treatment regimen is typically only four vaccinations (five for immunocompromised) in the arm, plus human rabies immune globulin.

3776,Chapter 48 Mucosal Vaccine Development for Veterinary and Aquatic Diseases,"Abstract Because most pathogens and food antigens enter the host via the mucosal surfaces, effective mucosal immunity is critical for maintaining homeostasis through immune regulation, tolerance, and induction of effective immune responses when needed. Thus the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues represent an important target for vaccination. Indeed, more than 20 years of research have clearly demonstrated the benefits of mucosal vaccination versus systemic vaccination. Such benefits include local induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as well as activation and maturation of mucosal dendritic cells, homing of effector cells to the mucosal surfaces, expression of specific host defense peptides, and other innate effector molecules. In addition, mucosal vaccination offers the opportunity to induce colostral and lactogenic immunity during pregnancy and the possibility of avoiding neutralization of early life vaccines by maternal antibodies, both of which are critical for protecting the most susceptible from infectious diseases. Moreover, mucosal administration offers the advantage of inducing both effective systemic immunity and mucosal immunity, enhancing vaccine efficacy and providing improved protection. A number of animal vaccines are already administered via the mucosal surfaces, with many more to come over the next few years. It is gratifying to see that veterinary vaccine development has yet again taken a leadership role in exploring innovative approaches and technologies to mucosal vaccination. For the veterinary field, considerations for mucosal vaccine development and use necessarily include costs (often pennies per dose), mass delivery that preferably avoids animal restraint, and economic and trade considerations. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the existing vaccine technologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.","Wilson, Heather L.; Gerdts, Volker; Babiuk, Lorne A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3777,Exploration and exploitation in crisis environment: Implications for level and variability of firm performance,"Abstract Exploration and exploitation are two generic strategies of firms' adaptation to their environments. However, the effectiveness and reliability of these approaches are not fully understood when the business environment is undergoing a major crisis. Building on organizational adaptation, strategic fit, and organizational decline streams of literature, we develop a framework that examines exploration and exploitation in crisis contexts. We argue that the severity of crisis a firm is exposed to acts as a positive contingency for the impact of exploration on firm performance level and variability, and as a negative contingency for exploitation’s level and variability effects. Employing the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model on the data from 500 Russian SMEs, we test the proposed theoretical framework linking exploration and exploitation activities to the distribution of firm performance under different conditions of the firm-specific crisis severity. The results provide an improved understanding of strategic management approaches under economic crises and related turbulence.","Osiyevskyy, Oleksiy; Shirokova, Galina; Ritala, Paavo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.04.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.04.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.04.015,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

3781,Aspartic acid at residue 185 modulates the capacity of HP-PRRSV nsp4 to antagonize IFN-I expression,"Abstract In a previous study, we have shown that highly-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) antagonizes type I IFN expression induced by poly(I:C). Here, we demonstrated that the mutation of Aspartic acid 185 (Asp185) impaired the ability of nsp4 to inhibit IFN-I production induced by poly(I:C). Subsequently, we verified that all the mutants at the residue 185, regardless of amino acid size (including Cys and Ser) and charge (including Glu and Lys), impaired nsp4 catalytic activity. However, when Asp185 in nsp4 was replaced by a similar structure amino acid Asparagine 185 (Asn185), nsp4 stayed but with a decreased protease activity. Importantly, the recombinant virus with Asn185 mutation in HP-PRRSV-nsp4 exhibited slower replication rate and higher ability to induce IFN-I expression compared with wild-type (wt) HP-PRRSV.","Wei, Ze-yu; Liu, Fang; Li, Yu; Wang, Hong-lei; Zhang, Zi-ding; Chen, Zhong-zhou; Feng, Wen-hai",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.007,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

3783,The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: What we know,"Abstract There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak from spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.","Wu, Di; Wu, Tiantian; Liu, Qun; Yang, Zhicong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.004,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
3784,"Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","Abstract Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses (P < 0.001); however, no statistical difference was observed compared to the scores of non-front-line nurses (P > 0.05). Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially non-front-line nurses, and general public under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat vicarious traumatization in medical staff and general public are extremely necessary.","Li, Zhenyu; Ge, Jingwu; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Qiao, Mei; Jiang, Riyue; Bi, Jiangjiang; Zhan, Gaofeng; Xu, Xiaolin; Wang, Long; Zhou, Qin; Zhou, Chenliang; Pan, Yinbing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhang, Haiwei; Yang, Jianjun; Zhu, Bin; Hu, Yimin; Hashimoto, Kenji; Jia, Yan; Wang, Haofei; Wang, Rong; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,10/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-10
3785,Simultaneous and automated detection of influenza A virus hemagglutinin H7 and H9 based on magnetism and size mediated microfluidic chip,"Abstract Influenza viruses with multiple subtypes have highly virulent in humans, of which influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the major viral surface antigen. Simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA are of great importance for early-stage diagnosis and operator protection. Herein, a magnetism and size mediated microfluidic platform was developed for point-of-care detection of multiple influenza HA. With multiplex microvalves and computer program control, the detection process showed high automation which had a great potential for avoiding the high-risk virus exposure to the operator. Taking advantage of magnetism and size mediated multiple physical fields, multiple influenza HA could be simultaneous separation and detection depended on different-size magnetic beads. Using high-luminance quantum dots as reporter, this assay achieved high sensitivity with a detection limit of 3.4 ng/mL for H7N9 HA and 4.5 ng/mL for H9N2 HA, and showed excellent specificity, anti-interference ability and good reproducibility. These results indicate that this method may propose new avenues for early detection of multiple influenza subtypes.","Wang, Shuibing; Ai, Zhao; Zhang, Zefen; Tang, Man; Zhang, Nangang; Liu, Feng; Han, Gujing; Hong, Shao-Li; Liu, Kan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,Elsevier,10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
3786,Clinical manifestations and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy,"Tang and colleagues, in this Journal, drew readers attention to emerging COVID19.1 We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy,2 pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. We identified all hospitalized pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 25, 2020 officially reported by the central government, in areas outside Wuhan, China. Information including age, geographic location, epidemiological history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, discharge data and outcome were obtained by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Local Health Commission. When necessary, we attempted to contact local hospital or patients by telephone to supply missing information. This investigation was part of an emergency public health outbreak investigation and therefore not subject to institutional review board. There were a total of 13 Chinese patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospitals outside of Wuhan (Table 1). There were 3 patients from Zhejiang, 3 from other cities of Hubei and 1 each from Fujian, Shanxi, Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Anhui. The maternal age ranged between 22 to 36 years. Two women were less than 28 weeks of gestation and the other 11 patients were in their third trimesters at presentation. None of the patients had underlying medical disease.","Liu, Yangli; Chen, Haihong; Tang, Kejing; Guo, Yubiao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.028,Elsevier,MA ID 2279386236,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
3787,The Chinese governance system: Its strengths and weaknesses in a comparative development perspective,"Abstract This is an overview paper focusing on the organizational aspects of the Chinese governance system and their relation to development. Compared to other developing countries like India, it has special positive features of career incentives promoting growth at the local level, the ability to take long-term decisions relatively quickly, and a unique blend of political centralization and decentralization of economic power and responsibility, that is conducive to central guidance and local business development. On the other hand, with a lack of sufficient downward (as opposed to upward) accountability and absence of institutionalized systems of scrutiny and challenge from below, mistakes or abuse of power are more difficult to check and correct quickly, political loyalty may often get a premium over performance at the upper levels, and there are insufficient checks on collusion between business and officials. The over-all organizational system is prone to over-reaction in times of crisis and thus only weakly resilient compared to systems where information flows from below are less controlled or choked.","Bardhan, Pranab",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
3788,Chapter 19 Current and New Approaches for Mucosal Vaccine Delivery,"Abstract Mucosal surfaces are the interface between the host’s internal milieu and the external environment, and they have dual functions, serving as physical barriers to foreign antigens and as accepting sites for vital materials. Mucosal vaccines are more favored to prevent mucosal infections from the portal of entry. Although mucosal vaccination has many advantages, licensed mucosal vaccines are scarce. The most widely studied mucosal routes are oral and intranasal. Licensed oral and intranasal vaccines are composed mostly of whole cell killed or live attenuated microorganisms serving as both delivery systems and built-in adjuvants. Future mucosal vaccines should be made with more purified antigen components, which will be relatively less immunogenic. To induce robust protective immune responses against well-purified vaccine antigens, an effective mucosal delivery system is an essential requisite. Recent developments in biomaterials and nanotechnology have enabled many innovative mucosal vaccine trials. For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier. Future mucosal vaccine carriers, regardless of administration routes, should have certain common characteristics. They should maintain stability in given environments, be mucoadhesive, and have the ability to target specific tissues and cells.","Rhee, Joon Haeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3789,Preventing respiratory syncytial virus infections in hospitalized children and adults: should we do better?,"Summary Objective To compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted to a French tertiary hospital, and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing infection control measures. Patients and methods We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p = 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p < 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting a good effectiveness of our infection control strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare personnel, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial RSV infections should be reinforced in adult wards.","Frange, Pierre; Toubiana, Julie; Parize, Perrine; Moulin, Florence; Scemla, Anne; Leruez-Ville, Marianne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,Elsevier,10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
3790,Clinical features of COVID-19 in elderly patients: A comparison with young and middle-aged patients,"Abstract Background Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different. Objective To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. Results A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all <0.05. Interpretation The mortality of elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients, and the proportion of patients with PSI grade IV and V is significantly higher than that of young and middle-aged patients.

3799,Chapter 20 The potential of exosomes as theragnostics in various clinical situations,"Abstract Exosomes are membrane-bound cargo measuring 30–140nm comprised of a lipid bilayer containing various proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and bioactive lipids that can be transferred between cells. They have been shown to be produced and released by many different types of healthy and diseased cells. Exosomes are secreted by all types of cells in culture, and are also found in various body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes are essential for healthy physiological as well as pathological processes. In addition to their normal function, exosomes are involved in the development and progression of various diseases, potentiating cellular stress and damage. Pathogens take advantage of exosome release from infected host cells by manipulating host-derived exosomes to evade the immune system responses. Exosomes are involved in other pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases, heart failure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, osteoporosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, we can exploit exosomes as biomarkers and vaccines and modify them rationally for therapeutic interventions including tissue engineering. Further studies on exosomes will explore their potential and provide new methodology for effective clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies: such uses can be called exosome theragnostics. This chapter reviews the potential theragnostic (diagnostic and therapeutic) application of exosomes in major organ systems in clinical fields.","Kang, Ju-Seop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3800,The effects of natural disasters on international tourism: A global analysis,"Tourism is shaped by a wide range of factors and forces, including exogenous ones that have no direct link with the tourism sector. Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing.","Rosselló, Jaume; Becken, Susanne; Santana-Gallego, Maria",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

3802,Testing for multiple bubbles in the copper price: Periodically collapsing behavior,"Abstract This study investigates whether multiple bubbles exist in the copper price on the basis of the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) approach (Phillips et al., 2013). This technique delivers date-stamping strategies for the emergence as well as collapse of explosive bubble episodes and is best suited for practical application to time series. The results reveal that four explosive bubbles are detected over the period of 1980–2019 when copper price deviates from fundamental value. Besides, this finding is in accordance with the asset pricing model (Gürkaynak, 2008), which generally considers both fundamental and bubble components in the presence of asset prices. Based on the empirical results, the multiple emergence and collapse of multiple price bubbles are attributed to speculation, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, an imbalance between supply and demand, and financial crises. Policymakers should actively recognize bubble episodes and monitor their evolution, which could be conducive to achieving the effective stabilization of the international copper price. To reduce excess price fluctuations and explosive copper bubbles, authorities should impose restrictions on excessive speculative behaviors under extreme market conditions.","Su, Chi-Wei; Wang, Xiao-Qing; Zhu, Haotian; Tao, Ran; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia; Lobonţ, Oana-Ramona",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3807,Chapter 2 Metagenomics revealing new virus species in farm and pet animals and aquaculture,"Abstract Viral metagenomics is slowly taking over the traditional and widely used molecular techniques for the investigation of pathogenic viruses responsible for illness and inflicting great economic burden on the farm animal industry. Owing to the continued improvements in sequencing technologies and the dramatic reduction of per base costs of sequencing the use of next generation sequencing have been key factors in this progress. Discoveries linked to viral metagenomics are expected to be beneficial to the field of veterinary medicine starting from the development of better diagnostic assays to the design of new subunit vaccines with minimal investments. With these achievements the research has taken a giant leap even toward the better healthcare of animals and, as a result, the animal sector could be growing at an unprecedented pace.","Kaszab, Eszter; Doszpoly, Andor; Lanave, Gianvito; Verma, Atul; Bányai, Krisztián; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Marton, Szilvia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3810,A decomposition-ensemble approach for tourism forecasting,"Abstract With the frequent occurrence of irregular events in recent years, the tourism industry in some areas, such as Hong Kong, has suffered great volatility. To enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, data characteristic analysis, and the Elman's neural network model. Using Hong Kong tourism demand as an empirical case, this study firstly investigates how data characteristic analysis is used in a decomposition-ensemble approach. The empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in both point and interval forecasts for different prediction horizons, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting tourism demand, especially for time series with complexity.","Xie, Gang; Qian, Yatong; Wang, Shouyang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,Elsevier,10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
3811,Chapter 16 Passive Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibody Therapies,"Abstract Passive antibody therapies have a long history of use. In the 19th century, antibodies from xenographic sources of polyclonal antibodies were used to treat infections (diphtheria). They were used often as protection from infectious agents and toxins. Complications related to their use involved development of immune complexes and severe allergic reactions. As a result, human source plasma for polyclonal antibodies became the preferential source for antibodies. They are used to treat infection, remove toxins, prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn, modify inflammatory reactions, and control autoimmune diseases. Continued improvements in processing decreased the transfusion/infusion transmission of infections. In the late 20th century (∼1986), monoclonal antibodies were developed. The first monoclonal antibodies were of xenographic source and were wrought with problems of immunogenicity. These forms of antibodies did not gain favor until chimerization took pace in the mid-1990s and in 1998 two monoclonal antibodies were approved one to treat respiratory syncytial virus and the other for breast cancers. Further development of humanized and then fully human monoclonal antibodies has led to an evolution of therapies with these agents. Monoclonal antibodies are being researched or approved to treat a multitude of diseases to include oncologic, inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, allergic, benign hematologic, infections, orthopedic, coagulopathy, metabolic and to decrease morbidity of disease (diminution of pain), modify disease progression, and potentially anatomic development. In this chapter, we will review the history of use of these passive antibody therapies, their mechanism of action, pharmacologic-therapeutic classification, particular medical indication, adverse reactions, and potential future use of these medications.","Pelletier, J.

3813,First report of two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks by the novel genotypes ON‐1 and NA‐2 in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Abstract Objective Respiratory syncytial virus is a pathogen frequently involved in nosocomial outbreaks. Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON‐1 and NA‐2 in a neonatal intensive care unit in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. Results From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus‐A (ten and 14 with ON‐1 and NA‐2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON‐1 and NA‐2 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. Conclusions Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus. Resumo Objetivo O vírus sincicial respiratório é um patógeno frequentemente envolvido em surtos nosocomiais. Embora vários estudos tenham relatado tais surtos em unidades de terapia intensiva neonatal, os dados epidemiológicos moleculares são escassos. Neste artigo, descrevemos dois surtos consecutivos de vírus sincicial respiratório causados pelos genótipos ON‐1 e NA‐2 em uma unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal em São Paulo, Brasil. Métodos Uma busca prospectiva por vírus sincicial respiratório foi realizada após o diagnóstico do caso índice e outros quatro recém‐nascidos sintomáticos na unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal. Amostras de aspirado nasofaríngeo de todos os pacientes da unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal foram testadas para 17 vírus respiratórios com reação em cadeia da polimerase via transcriptase reversa em tempo real. A genotipagem realizada utilizando sequenciamento de nucleotídeos. Resultados De maio a agosto de 2013, foram detectados dois surtos diferentes na unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal. Vinte e quatro crianças foram infectadas com vírus sincicial respiratório‐A (10 e 14 com os genótipos ON‐1 e NA‐2, respectivamente). A média da idade dos lactentes era de 10 dias, o peso médio ao nascer foi de 1961g e a idade gestacional média de 33 semanas. Fatores de risco (doença cardíaca, doença pulmonar e prematuridade) estavam presentes em 80% e 85,7% dos bebês nos grupos ON‐1 e NA‐2, respectivamente. No total, 45,8% dos lactentes eram assintomáticos e 20,8% necessitaram de ventilação mecânica. Não foram detectadas coinfecções durante os surtos. Conclusões Bebês em unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal que desenvolvem sintomas respiratórios abruptos devem ser testados para vírus respiratórios, especialmente o vírus sincicial respiratório. Mesmo na ausência de sintomas graves, a detecção de vírus sincicial respiratório pode prevenir a transmissão nosocomial através de medidas de controle de infecção. Um melhor entendimento da epidemiologia molecular do vírus sincicial respiratório é essencial para o desenvolvimento de novas vacinas e drogas antivirais contra o vírus sincicial respiratório.","Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalhães, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
3814,Sustainable soil use and management: An interdisciplinary and systematic approach,"Abstract Soil is a key component of Earth's critical zone. It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.","Hou, Deyi; Bolan, Nanthi S.; Tsang, Daniel C.W.; Kirkham, Mary B.; O'Connor, David",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138961,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138961,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138961,10/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-10
3815,Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19,"Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shi, Yudong; Wang, Juan; Yang, Yating; Wang, Zhiqiang; Wang, Guoqing; Hashimoto, Kenji; Zhang, Kai; Liu, Huanzhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3819,Chapter 6 Ecoepidemiology of Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses,"Abstract Within the ecosystems, the balance is important since the populations maintain their size and the food habits that are constant over time; in contrast, the disappearance of natural sources or the alteration of habitat at different levels can cause major changes in the very structure of the ecosystem. Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming, climatic changes, which together with globalization, increased trade, the shortening of distances thanks to transport, the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. Vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks; wild birds are reservoirs for the West Nile virus, small wild mammals such as rodents, bats, and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses, and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown.","Guzmán, Camilo; Calderón, Alfonso; Mattar, Salim; Tadeu-Figuereido, Luiz; Salazar-Bravo, Jorge; Alvis-Guzmán, Nelson; Martinez, Elias Zakzuk; González, Marco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3820,Interrupting COVID-19 transmission by implementing enhanced traffic control bundling: Implications for global prevention and control efforts,"Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19’s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan’s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB’s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector – the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community. Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan’s success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Schwartz, Jonathan; Chen, Shey-Ying; King, Chwan-Chuen; Yang, Guang-Yang; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14
3821,Chapter 11 Medical Management and Diagnostic Approaches,"Abstract This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. As is the case with all other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems so they can be communicated to appropriate veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed toward individual animals and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Topics include individual animal monitoring and care, signs of illness and distress, colony health management, components of microbiological monitoring programs, including agents commonly targeted and sentinel programs, quarantine, biological material screening, diagnostic testing methodologies, including culture, serology, molecular diagnostic and histopathology, test profiles and interpretation, management of disease outbreaks, and treatment and prevention strategies for infectious agents.","Otto, Glen M.; Myles, Matthew H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3829,Hospital biopreparedness in the Looming Presence of SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19,"The recent analysis of 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and their clinical characteristics, has given credence to stronger investments into hospital biopreparedness and overall infection prevention efforts.1 Within this analysis, researchers found two pieces that are particularly relevant to healthcare preparedness: first, that 26% of patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and second, that 41% of cases were related to healthcare transmission. Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcare‐associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARS‐CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3","Popescu, Saskia",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.149,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136478/,PMC,10.1002/hsr2.149,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09
3830,Chaos in a nonautonomous eco-epidemiological model with delay,"Abstract In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonautonomous predator-prey model with disease in prey, and a discrete time delay for the incubation period in disease transmission. Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov’s functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system’s behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasi-periodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.","Samanta, Sudip; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Alzahrani, Abdullah K.; Alshomrani, Ali Saleh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3833,Chapter 3 Immunobiological aspects of vaccines in pregnancy: Maternal perspective,"Abstract Immunization during pregnancy is an efficient strategy to protect both the mother and the newborn infant against infectious pathogens. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to severe infections caused by some pathogens, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Pregnancy is associated with dynamic changes in maternal immune system that are critical for tolerance of the fetus. These changes could also play an important role in shaping maternal immune components that are transferred to the newborn infant following natural infection or vaccination to prevent infectious diseases in early life. As the momentum for maternal immunization is growing, there is a need to increase our understanding of the immunobiology of maternal immunization in order to better prevent infectious diseases in the pregnant women and the young infant.","Chu, Helen Y.; Marchant, Arnaud",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3834,Study on the motion law of aerosols produced by human respiration under the action of thermal plume of different intensities,"Abstract Predicting influence of human thermal plume on the diffusion of respiration-produced particles is an important issue for improving indoor air quality through eliminating infectious microbes efficiently. In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.","Feng, Guohui; Bi, Yang; Zhang, Yixian; Cai, Yilin; Huang, Kailiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3838,"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

3840,Spatiotemporal variability and key influencing factors of river fecal coliform within a typical complex watershed,"Abstract Fecal coliform bacteria are a key indicator of human health risks; however, the spatiotemporal variability and key influencing factors of river fecal coliform have yet to be explored in a rural-suburban-urban watershed with multiple land uses. In this study, the fecal coliform concentrations in 21 river sections were monitored for 20 months, and 441 samples were analyzed. Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of fecal coliform. The results showed that spatial differences were mainly dominated by urbanization level, and environmental factors could explain the temporal dynamics of fecal coliform in different urban patterns except in areas with high urbanization levels. Reducing suspended solids is a direct way to manage fecal coliform in the Beiyun River when the natural factors are difficulty to change, such as temperature and solar radiation. The export of fecal coliform from urban areas showed a quick and sensitive response to rainfall events and increased dozens of times in the short term. Landscape patterns, such as the fragmentation of impervious surfaces and the overall landscape, were identified as key factors influencing urban non-point source bacteria. The results obtained from this study will provide insight into the management of river fecal pollution.","Zhang, Xiaoyue; Zhi, Xiaosha; Chen, Lei; Shen, Zhenyao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115835,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115835,Elsevier,10.1016/j.watres.2020.115835,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01

3844,2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak: A new challenge,"Abstract Objectives Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment. Methods The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV’ or ‘COVID-19’. Results Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8–92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. Conclusion The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities.","Lupia, Tommaso; Scabini, Silvia; Mornese Pinna, Simone; Di Perri, Giovanni; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Corcione, Silvia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021,Elsevier,MA ID 3003218364,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3846,Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses,"Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.

3847,Incidence and Impact of Community Respiratory Viral Infection (CRV) in Haploidentical and Matched Sibling Donors Receiving Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy): A CIBMTR Analysis,"There are reports of high rates of viral infections after haploidentical transplant, particularly in the setting of PTCy (HaploCy) but detailed data on incidence are lacking. We describe here the comparative incidence of community respiratory virus (CRV) infections occurring by day 180 post-transplant by donor source and their impact on outcomes including survival, relapse, chronic GVHD, and transplant related mortality (TRM) using CIBMTR registry data. The analysis included 2765 patients, all > 2 years of age, who underwent first allogeneic HCT for AML, ALL or MDS from 100 centers between 2012 and 2017 receiving either HaploCy (n=757), Matched related donor (MRD) transplant with PTCy (SibCy n= 403), and MRD transplant with calcineurin inhibitor and either MTX or MMF (SibCNI n= 1605). The cumulative incidences of CRV in the HaploCy, SibCy and SibCNI were: 3% (99% CI, 1.6-4.8), 3% (1.3-5.5) and 2.4 %(1.5-3.5) respectively at day 30 (P =0.649, NS), but notably higher at 15.5% (12.3-19), 16.2% (11.7-21.2) and 9.4 %(7.6-11.4) at 6 months (P<.001) post-transplant [Figure 1]. Identified CRV included primarily Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, and RSV accounting for approximately 70% of all CRV reported [Table 1]. Figure 2 shows the multivariable models through 2 years post-transplant for survival, relapse, TRM, and chronic GVHD with a reference group of SibCNI without CRV infection for the main effect variable of donor type and infection. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRV by day 180 had a higher risk of TRM [p=0.002] and inferior survival [p = 0.001] compared to the reference group. Older age, more advanced disease, and higher HCT-CI were all associated with increased mortality. The incidence of CRVs is higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor. This finding justifies further studies to understand long-term antiviral immune recovery in different donor sources and GVHD prophylaxis regimens. The higher overall mortality for HaploCy patients developing CRV infection warrants consideration for patient education and heightened awareness for clinicians, as well as long term follow up studies of such patients.","Taplitz, Randy; Maziarz, Richard T.; Mulroney, Carolyn; Perales, Miguel; Romee, Rizwan; Goldsmith, Scott R.; Fuchs, Ephraim J.; Bashey, Asad; Ciurea, Stefan O.; Singh, Anurag K; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Kim, Soyoung; Chen, Min; Chemaly, Roy F.; Komanduri, Krishna V.; Riches, Marcie L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
3848,Aetiology of Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex and Prevalence of its Pathogens in Europe,"Summary The canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is an endemic worldwide syndrome involving multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Traditionally, Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV) were considered the major causative agents. Lately, new pathogens have been implicated in the development of CIRDC, namely canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. To better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of CIRDC and their epidemiological relevance in Europe, prevalence data were collected from peer-reviewed publications and summarized. Evidence of exposure to Bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs. Co-infections with viral pathogens are common. The findings confirm that Bb is an important cause of CIRDC in Europe. CAV-2 and CDV recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination. Seroconversion to CHV can be demonstrated following CIRDC outbreaks and CHV has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs. There is some evidence that CHV is not a primary cause of CIRDC, but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease. The currently available data suggest that CIV is, at present, neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in Europe. CPiV remains an important pathogen in CIRDC and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens. CnPnV and CRCoV are important new elements in the aetiology of CIRDC and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments. M. cynos is common in Europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs. This organism is frequently found together with other CIRDC pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs. S. zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels. Protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete, and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination. However, even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages. They reduce spread, increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials. Recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of CIRDC will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog.","Day, M.J.; Carey, S.; Clercx, C.; Kohn, B.; MarsilIo, F.; Thiry, E.; Freyburger, L.; Schulz, B.; Walker, D.J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

The first case is a 57-year-old man with no relevant past medical, travel, or contact history, who presented to a regional hospital on Feb 9, 2020, with 3 days of fever and cough. He had thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140 × 109/mL) and a normal chest radiograph. He was discharged after a negative rapid test for dengue NS1, IgM, and IgG (SD Bioline Dengue Duo Kit; Abbott, South Korea). He returned to a public primary health-care clinic with persistent fever, worsening thrombocytopenia (89 × 109/mL), and new onset lymphopenia (0·43 × 109/mL). A repeat dengue rapid test was positive for dengue IgM and IgG (Dengue Combo; Wells Bio, South Korea). He was referred to hospital for dengue with worsening cough and dyspnoea. A chest radiograph led to testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in-house laboratory-developed test detecting the N and ORF1ab genes) from a nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive.

3853,"Asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2): Facts and myths","Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Liu, Yen Hung; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Yen, Muh-Yen; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012,CZI,MA ID 2029688661,2020,NA,NA,2020

This year was to be the “super year” for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to manage both disaster risks and potential health-emergencies, particularly for humanitarian coordination aspects; and the strengthening of community-level preparedness and response.","Djalante, Riyanti; Shaw, Rajib; DeWit, Andrew",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3857,36 Viral Febrile Illnesses and Emerging Pathogens,"Abstract Emerging or emerged diseases and viral pathogens are responsible historically and currently for large epidemics, global pandemics, and significant morbidity and mortality. Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.","Endy, Timothy P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3864,Chapter 10 Genes conferring immunity against viral infections,"Abstract Immunity against viral infection is different from that for other infections. The virus utilizes the host’s immune mechanism for its survival and infection. Innate immune reaction is initially activated by conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, pattern recognition receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, MDA5, LGP2, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3 and TLR7. Some important molecules responsible for viral infection include cytokines and chemokines. The current chapter includes the basic mechanism of action of immune-response genes and a list of important genes and their protein IDs. Chemokines include CCL19 and CCL21, and reactivate antiviral CCR7, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, a CC chemokine, and interleukin 8, an interferon-stimulated gene.","Pal, Aruna; Chakravarty, A.K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3865,Severe air pollution events not avoided by reduced anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 outbreak,"Abstract Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 μg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 μg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7.78, 9.51, 11.38, 13.42, 13.64, 14.15, 14.42, 16.95 and 22.08 μg/m3 in Shanghai, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Tianjin, Zhengzhou and Wuhan, respectively. The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable. More efforts should be made to completely avoid severe air pollution.","Wang, Pengfei; Chen, Kaiyu; Zhu, Shengqiang; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Hongliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Wu, Canrong; Liu, Yang; Yang, Yueying; Zhang, Peng; Zhong, Wu; Wang, Yali; Wang, Qiqi; Xu, Yang; Li, Mingxue; Li, Xingzhou; Zheng, Mengzhu; Chen, Lixia; Li, Hua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008,CZI,MA ID 2763848918,2020,NA,NA,2020

Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62% - 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Other compounds such as 0.05% - 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. An effective surface disinfection may help to ensure an early containment and prevention of further viral spread.","Kampf, Günter",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100044,CZI,MA ID 3006062275,2020,NA,NA,2020

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.

3886,Chapter 4 Interaction of virus populations with their hosts,"Abstract Viral population numbers are extremely large compared with those of their host species. Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided into basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3889,Chapter 9 Trends in antiviral strategies,"Abstract Viral populations are true moving targets regarding the genomic sequences to be targeted in antiviral designs. Experts from different fields have expressed the need for new paradigms for antiviral interventions and viral disease control. This chapter reviews several antiviral strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins suboptimal or nonfunctional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intrapopulation interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3893,"Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak","Abstract We assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of confinement to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China. On Feb 20–21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon individuals’ existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not infected by the virus, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Zhang, Stephen X.; Wang, Yifei; Rauch, Andreas; Wei, Feng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
3894,Colorimetric biosensors for point-of-care virus detections,"Abstract Colorimetric biosensors can be used to detect a particular analyte through color changes easily by naked eyes or simple portable optical detectors for quantitative measurement. Thus, it is highly attractive for point-of-care detections of harmful viruses to prevent potential pandemic outbreak, as antiviral medication must be administered in a timely fashion. This review paper summaries existing and emerging techniques that can be employed to detect viruses through colorimetric assay design with detailed discussion of their sensing principles, performances as well as pros and cons, with an aim to provide guideline on the selection of suitable colorimetric biosensors for detecting different species of viruses. Among the colorimetric methods for virus detections, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is more favourable for its faster detection, high efficiency, cheaper cost, and more reliable with high reproducible assay results. Nanoparticle-based colorimetric biosensors, on the other hand, are most suitable to be fabricated into lateral flow or lab-on-a-chip devices, and can be coupled with LAMP or portable PCR systems for highly sensitive on-site detection of viruses, which is very critical for early diagnosis of virus infections and to prevent outbreak in a swift and controlled manner.","Zhao, Victoria Xin Ting; Wong, Ten It; Zheng, Xin Ting; Tan, Yen Nee; Zhou, Xiaodong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3900,Responding to natural disasters vs. disease outbreaks: Do emergency medical service providers have different views?,"Abstract Introduction Our planet has been experiencing a huge burden of natural disasters and public health emergencies in the last three decades. Emergency medical service providers are expected to be in the frontlines during such emergencies. Yet, this system is badly understudied when it comes to its roles and performance during disasters and public health emergencies. This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers’ views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions. Methods This study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach. Results Three themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences. For disease outbreaks, however, the two themes were concerned and no additional risk. While participants expressed varying concerns about working during disasters and pandemic conditions, everyone felt willing and obligated to come to work despite the perceived high risk for some of them to work in some conditions. Conclusion This study helps to provide the base upon which EMS, public health, and emergency management agencies can formulate actions that emerged from the views of EMS providers concerning work during disasters and public health emergencies.","Alwidyan, Mahmoud T.; Trainor, Joseph E.; Bissell, Richard A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
3901,Chapter 6 Virus population dynamics examined with experimental model systems,"Abstract Experimental evolution permits exploring the effect of controlled environmental variables in virus evolution. Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimens. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses. The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3903,Chapter 7 Nanoparticle-based vaccines opportunities and limitations,"Abstract Infectious diseases are the tip of the iceberg in the economic burden of the developing countries, due to the resistance of the pathogens to antibiotics and the lack of vaccines. The vaccines have become a big challenge in the last decades, where the attention has been focused on scientific challenges such as new vaccine development and adjuvants or delivery systems. The classical vaccines were developed from live-attenuated or killed organisms, such as influenza, smallpox, and BCG, as well as subunits such as Hepatitis B. The attenuated vaccines carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under immunosuppression conditions. The development of subunit vaccines without risk are considered as an essential need in combination with adequate delivery systems to obtain desired cell and humoral immune responses against infectious diseases. In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.","Diaz-Arévalo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3905,Active fractions of mannoproteins derived from yeast cell wall stimulate innate and acquired immunity of adult and elderly dogs,"Abstract Nutritional intervention in older dogs aims to increase lifespan and improve life quality as well as delay the development of diseases related to ageing. It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.","Kroll, F.S.A.; Putarov, T.C.; Zaine, L.; Venturini, K.S.; Aoki, C.G.; Santos, J.P.F.; Pedrinelli, V.; Vendramini, T.H.A.; Brunetto, M.A.; Carciofi, A.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Whereas virus taxonomy has been a niche subspecialty over many decades, the field has recently gained importance due to the exponentially increasing number of new viruses discovered by next-generation sequencing methods. The expanded known global virome and associated viral genome sequence space gradually morph virus taxonomy from a phenotype-based and inherently subjective process, focussing on shared or distinct, often arbitrarily chosen biophysical characteristics of virions to a significant subspecialty of systematic evolutionary biology. Indeed, current virus classification is increasingly performed using ever more complex phylogenetic approaches that move researchers closer to a rudimentary understanding of the origin, evolution, relatedness, and diversification of viruses over eons.","Kuhn, Jens H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3912,In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus,"Objective In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify treatments containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 treatments were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.","Zhang, Deng-hai; Wu, Kun-lun; Zhang, Xue; Deng, Sheng-qiong; Peng, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005,CZI,MA ID 1577002143,2020,NA,NA,2020
3913,World Economic Prospects Monthly,"Overview: Coronavirus to cut global growth to new lows ▀ The rapid spread of coronavirus will weaken China's GDP growth sharply in the short term, causing disruption for the rest of the world. We now expect global GDP growth to slow to just 1.9% y/y in Q1 this year and have lowered our forecast for 2020 as a whole from 2.5% to 2.3%, down from 2.6% in 2019. ▀ Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, there had been signs that the worst was over for both world trade and the manufacturing sector. However, this tentative optimism has been dashed by the current disruption. ▀ While the near‐term impact of the virus is uncertain, the disruption to China will clearly be significant in Q1 – we expect Chinese GDP growth to plunge to just 3.8% y/y. Even though growth there will rebound in Q2 and Q3, it will take time for the loss in activity to be fully recovered and we now expect GDP growth of just 5.4% for 2020 as a whole, a downward revision of 0.6pp from last month. ▀ Weaker Chinese imports and tourism and disruption to global supply chains will take a toll on the rest of the world, particularly in the Asia‐Pacific region. And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. ▀ Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast. We have cut our projection for growth in crude demand in 2020 by 0.2m b/d to 0.9 mb/d and now forecast Brent crude will average $62.4pb in 2020, down from about $65pb in our January forecast. ▀ Quarterly global growth is likely to strengthen a little in H2 this year as the disruption fades and firms make up for the lost output earlier in the year and the effect of China's policy response starts to feed through.

3914,Epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of 32 critical and 67 noncritical cases of COVID-19 in Chengdu,"Abstract Background In December 2019, Wuhan, China, experienced an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19). The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. Objectives This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. Study design This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. Results Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as mean ± standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39 ± 18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32 ± 6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were p < 0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were p < 0.05. Conclusions We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients. Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.","Zheng, Yongli; Xu, Hong; Yang, Ming; Zeng, Yilan; Chen, Hong; Liu, Ru; Li, Qingfeng; Zhang, Na; Wang, Dan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104366,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104366,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104366,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

3917,Role of vaccine efficacy in the vaccination behavior under myopic update rule on complex networks,"Abstract How to effectively prevent the diffusion of infectious disease has become an intriguing topic in the field of public hygienics. To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player’s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","Huang, Jiechen; Wang, Juan; Xia, Chengyi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

3919,Taking the right measures to control COVID-19,"First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.","Xiao, Yonghong; Torok, Mili Estee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30152-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30152-3,Elsevier,MA ID 3006007867,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05

3921,Association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infection in 122 cities from China,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. Methods Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. Results The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3 °C and became flat above 3 °C. When mean temperature (lag0–14) was below 3 °C, each 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209–6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 °C. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline when the weather becomes warmer, which provides useful implications for policymakers and the public.","Xie, Jingui; Zhu, Yongjian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01

3929,The deadly coronaviruses: The 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2020 novel coronavirus epidemic in China,"Abstract The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.","Yang, Yongshi; Peng, Fujun; Wang, Runsheng; Guan, Kai; Jiang, Taijiao; Xu, Guogang; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434,Elsevier,MA ID 2999409984,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03

3938,Chapter 5 Bay Leaf,"Abstract Bay leaf (Laurus nobilis) is a perennial shrub belongs to the family laurel (Lauraceae). It has been cultivated throughout the European, tropical, subtropical, and Asian countries. It has been used for thousands of years for food flavoring, essential oil applications, and in traditional medicine. Mostly, it contains tannins, flavones, flavonoids, alkaloids, eugenol, linalool, methyl chavicol, and anthocyanins. The extent of each of these chemical constituents varies depending on the type of species or cultivars as well as cultivation conditions such as soil type, weather, irrigation, pruning, and other horticultural practices. Bay is an essential component of several industrial applications that range from food to cosmetics to pharmaceutical products. Bay leaf has many biologic activities such as wound healing activity, antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, antiviral activity, immunostimulant activity, anticholinergic activity, antifungal activity, insect repellant activity, anticonvulsant activity, antimutagenic activity, and analgesic and antiinflammatory activity.","Batool, Saima; Khera, Rasheed Ahmad; Hanif, Muhammad Asif; Ayub, Muhammad Adnan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
3939,COVID-19 in a MS patient treated with ocrelizumab: does immunosuppression have a protective role?,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world. It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Results Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred. Discussion This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.","Novi, Giovanni; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Briano, Federica; Toscanini, Federica; Tazza, Francesco; Uccelli, Antonio; Inglese, Matilde",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102120,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102120,Elsevier,10.1016/j.msard.2020.102120,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

3941,Chapter 18 Use of artificial intelligence in infectious diseases,"Abstract Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms belonging to the class of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases. This chapter covers a series of applications selectively chosen to showcase how artificial intelligence is moving the field of infectious disease further and how it helps institutions to better tackles them, especially in low-income countries.","Agrebi, Said; Larbi, Anis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3943,New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?,"ABSTRACT Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Devaux, Christian A.; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105938,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12

3946,Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case,"Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model’s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.","Ivanov, Dmitry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

3949,15 An overview of automated room disinfection systems: When to use them and how to choose them,"Abstract Conventional disinfection methods are limited by reliance on the operator to ensure appropriate selection, formulation, distribution, and contact time of the agent. Automated room disinfection (ARD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the efficacy of terminal disinfection. The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapor (H2O2 vapor), aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP), and ultraviolet (UV) light. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, efficacy, process time, and ease of use. The choice of ARD system should be influenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation, and cost considerations.","Otter, J.A.; Yezli, S.; Barbut, F.; Perl, T.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

In this study, an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on a EuNPs-mAb fluorescent probe was developed and optimized for rapid detection of PEDV. The limit of detection (LOD) of the ICA was 0.218 μg/mL (2.725 × 103 TCID50/mL) and its linear detection range was 0.03125–8 μg/mL (3.91 × 102-105 TCID50/mL). The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples. 60 swine stool samples from southern China were analyzed by the ICA and RT-PCR, and the results showed that the coincidence rate of the ICA to RT-PCR was 86.67%, which was significantly higher than that of AuNPs based ICA. The ICA is sensitive and specific and can achieve on-site rapid detection of swine stool samples. Therefore, the ICA has a great potential for PED diagnosis and prevention.","Xu, Fei; Jin, Zhiyuan; Zou, Siyi; Chen, Chaoqun; Song, Qifang; Deng, Shengchao; Xiao, Wei; Zhang, Xiaoli; Jia, Aiqing; Tang, Yong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.120865,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.120865,Elsevier,MA ID 2084580389,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01

3967,Chapter 8 Forensic public health epidemiological and microbiological investigations for biosecurity,"Abstract Deliberate dissemination of a biological agent via several different routes presents the latest challenge to global public health security. Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern. This chapter discusses how epidemiology integrated with laboratory science can be used to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins—especially for attribution purposes.","Khan, Ali S.; Amara, Philip S.; Morse, Stephen A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3969,"Diseases, Emerging and Infectious","Abstract Emerging and infectious diseases have persisted as leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Caused by pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, they are known to pose serious health threats to the world's population dating back to ancient Egypt. In the 14th Century alone, infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20–45% of the world's population. The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore, an effective surveillance system, and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.","Antabe, Roger; Ziegler, Bianca Rosa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

3971,Beijing's Hard and Soft Repression in Hong Kong,"Abstract Hong Kong's new Police Commissioner Chris Tang announced in Beijing on December 7, 2019, that he would use “both hard and soft approaches” to end the anti-government protests. This article argues that such “approaches” amount to physical and non-physical repression—hard power, but employed by Hong Kong, rather than mainland, forces, combined with sharp power exercised by both Beijing and the local authorities. These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the “one country, two systems” model. As Beijing cannot send the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong's once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland's public security. And as Hong Kong's judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city's freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors. To zoom in on Beijing's hard and soft repression, this article examines in closer detail the other “frontliners” at protest sites who provide professional services vital to the sustainability of protests: medics, firefighters, lawyers, journalists, and educators.","Hui, Victoria Tin-bor",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The full genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been shared, and data have been gathered from several case series. As of February 11, 2020, there have been 45,182 laboratory-confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, with 1115 deaths, for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.5%. Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries. On average, each patient infects 2.2 other people. Symptomatic infection appears to predominantly affect adults, with a 5-day estimated incubation period between infection and symptom onset. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue. All cases reported to date have shown radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 2019-nCoV is diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is largely supportive, with regimens including antiviral therapy. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended.

3973,Comorbidities in COVID-19: Outcomes in hypertensive cohort and controversies with renin angiotensin system blockers,"Abstract Background and aims COVID-19 is already a pandemic. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). Methods We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. Results From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n = 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. Conclusion Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Gupta, Ritesh; Misra, Anoop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.016,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.016,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.016,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31
3974,Temporal and spatial evolution of online public sentiment on emergencies,"Abstract The transmission of online emergency information has become an active means of expressing public opinion and has vitally affected societal emergency response techniques. This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types—natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events—and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.","Li, Shiyue; Liu, Zixuan; Li, Yanling",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

3977,Chapter 3 Viral Emerging Pathogen Evolution,"Abstract The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases throughout history has been the product of the interaction of infectious agents, immunity, selective pressure, and environmental factors. The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.","Rodríguez, Virginia; Lagares, Alfredo; Arteaga, Heiser; Mattar, Salim; Ruiz, Luis Carlos",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests).

3982,"Venous and arterial thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic hospital in Milan, Italy","Abstract Background Few data are available on the rate and characteristics of thromboembolic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods We studied consecutive symptomatic patients with laboratory-proven COVID-19 admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy (13.02.2020–10.04.2020). The primary outcome was any thromboembolic complication, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary outcome was overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Results We included 388 patients (median age 66 years, 68% men, 16% requiring intensive care [ICU]). Thromboprophylaxis was used in 100% of ICU patients and 75% of those on the general ward. Thromboembolic events occurred in 28 (7.7% of closed cases; 95%CI 5.4%–11.0%), corresponding to a cumulative rate of 21% (27.6% ICU, 6.6% general ward). Half of the thromboembolic events were diagnosed within 24 h of hospital admission. Forty-four patients underwent VTE imaging tests and VTE was confirmed in 16 (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in 30 patients, corresponding to 7.7% of total, and pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 (33% of CTPA). The rate of ischemic stroke and ACS/MI was 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. Overt DIC was present in 8 (2.2%) patients. Conclusions The high number of arterial and, in particular, venous thromboembolic events diagnosed within 24 h of admission and the high rate of positive VTE imaging tests among the few COVID-19 patients tested suggest that there is an urgent need to improve specific VTE diagnostic strategies and investigate the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory COVID-19 patients.","Lodigiani, Corrado; Iapichino, Giacomo; Carenzo, Luca; Cecconi, Maurizio; Ferrazzi, Paola; Sebastian, Tim; Kucher, Nils; Studt, Jan-Dirk; Sacco, Clara; Alexia, Bertuzzi; Sandri, Maria Teresa; Barco, Stefano",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.024,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

3984,Chapter 13 Biotechnological innovations in farm and pet animal disease diagnosis,"Abstract The application of innovative diagnostic technologies for the detection of animal pathogens at an early stage is essential in restricting the economic loss incurred due to emerging infectious animal diseases. The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society. Therefore, this chapter primarily describes and discusses in detail the serological, molecular, novel high-throughput, and POC assays to detect pathogens affecting farm and companion animals.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Verma, Atul; Kumar, Naveen; Deol, Pallavi; Kumar, Deepak; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model.

3989,33 Viral Respiratory Infections,"Abstract Acute respiratory illnesses are the most frequently occurring illness in all age groups globally. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral respiratory tract infection.","van Doorn, H.

3992,Structure analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV,"2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.","Chen, Yun; Guo, Yao; Pan, Yihang; Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.071,CZI,MA ID 3006594788,2020,NA,NA,2020

4002,Chapter 16 Shikimic acid as intermediary model for the production of drugs effective against influenza virus,"Abstract This chapter explains the application of shikimic acid as preventive medicine for the outbreak of swine or Avian flu due to H1N1 virus. Shikimic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid), a natural organic compound, is generally utilized as a starting material for industrial synthesis of the antiviral oseltamivir, a drug against the H1N1 influenza virus. It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or Tamiflu derived from shikimic acid pathway have been found to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains.","Priyanka Singh, ; Gupta, Ena; Neha Mishra, ; Mishra, Pragya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4003,Community‐acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management,"Abstract Objective To provide cutting‐edge information for the management of community‐acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. Data source A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community‐acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. Data synthesis In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community‐acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤ 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community‐acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X‐ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77‐98%) and 93% (90‐99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. Conclusions Distinct aspects of childhood community‐acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades. Resumo Objetivo Fornecer informações de ponta para o manejo de crianças menores de cinco anos com pneumonia adquirida na comunidade, com base nas evidências mais recentes publicadas na literatura. Fonte de dados Uma pesquisa abrangente foi feita no PubMed, com as expressões: “community‐acquired pneumonia” + “child” + “etiology” ou “diagnosis” ou “severity” ou “antibiotic”. Todos os artigos encontrados tiveram o título e o resumo lidos e os artigos que relatavam as evidências mais recentes sobre cada assunto foram identificados e recuperados para leitura completa. Síntese dos dados Na era das vacinas bacterianas conjugadas amplamente usadas e do uso difundido de técnicas de amplificação de ácidos nucléicos, os vírus respiratórios foram identificados como os agentes causadores mais frequentes de pneumonia adquirida na comunidade em pacientes com menos de cinco anos. A hipoxemia (saturação de oxigênio ≤ 96%) e o aumento do esforço respiratório são os sinais mais associados à pneumonia adquirida na comunidade. A sibilância detectada ao exame físico prediz de forma independente a infecção viral e o valor preditivo negativo (intervalo de confiança de 95%) da radiografia de tórax normal e a procalcitonina sérica < 0,25 ng/dL foi de 92% (77‐98%) e 93% (90‐99%), respectivamente. Incapacidade de beber e se alimentar, vomitar todo o alimento, convulsões, retração torácica subcostal, cianose central, letargia, aleteo nasal, estridor e saturação de oxigênio < 90% são preditores de óbito e podem ser usados como indicadores de hospitalização. Derrames pleurais moderados/grandes e infiltrados multilobulares são preditores de doença grave. A amoxicilina administrada por via oral é a opção de primeira linha para tratar pacientes ambulatoriais e a ampicilina ou penicilina cristalina G ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) são as opções de primeira linha para tratar pacientes hospitalizados.

4004,Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are lower than other coronaviruses suggesting a faster protein synthesis rate of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV,"Abstract Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.","Yang, Chu-Wen; Chen, Mei-Fang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,10/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-10
4005,"Chapter 16 Combustion, reactive hazard, and bioprocess safety","Abstract Is bioprocess dangerous? How to maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories—physical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of “significant amount” of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway. As a bioprocess engineer, you will be responsible for creating safe processes and protecting the lives and health of your colleagues.","Liu, Shijie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The first case in Malaysia was identified on 25 January 2020 and the number of cases continue to rise since March 2020. Therefore, 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented with the aim to isolate the source of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, there were fewer number of motor vehicles on the road and the operation of industries was suspended, ergo reducing emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the atmosphere. We had acquired the Air Pollutant Index (API) data from the Department of Environment Malaysia on hourly basis before and during the MCO with the aim to track the changes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 68 air quality monitoring stations. It was found that the PM2.5 concentrations showed a high reduction of up to 58.4% during the MCO. Several red zone areas (>41 confirmed COVID-19 cases) had also reduced of up to 28.3% in the PM2.5 concentrations variation. The reduction did not solely depend on MCO, thus the researchers suggest a further study considering the influencing factors that need to be adhered to in the future.","Abdullah, Samsuri; Mansor, Amalina Abu; Napi, Nur Nazmi Liyana Mohd; Mansor, Wan Nurdiyana Wan; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Ismail, Marzuki; Ramly, Zamzam Tuah Ahmad",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139022,10/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-10

4015,Chapter 11 Baculovirus-Derived Vectors for Immunization and Therapeutic Applications,"Abstract Baculoviruses are arthropod-specific, enveloped viruses with circular, supercoiled double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid genomes. While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Finally, we review the baculovirus-derived products on the market and in the pipeline for biomedical and veterinary use.","Fabre, M.

4018,Integrating traditional Chinese medicines into professional community pharmacy practice in China – Key stakeholder perspectives,"Abstract Introduction In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an integral part of the health system in parallel with Western medicine (WM). However, pharmacists’ duty of care at this interface has not been fully explored. This qualitative study aimed to explore key stakeholders’ perceptions about the challenges and enablers to pharmacists’ adopting a professional role in patient care associated with the concurrent use of herbal medicines (HMs). Methods Participants were recruited from the expert pool of the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development using purposive sampling and snowballing. Participants targeted included government, academics and practicing pharmacists. An interview guide was developed following a literature review and face-to-face, audiotaped interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Results Fourteen semi-structured interviews with both practicing pharmacists and key stakeholder representatives were conducted in China in 2017. Thematic analysis identified 6 main themes which focused on how TCM was integrated with WM in China. Participants agreed that pharmacists should at least assume a role in drug safety associated with concurrent use of TCM and WM. However, barriers were identified within the government, education, pharmacy, pharmacist and research sectors, indicating a lack of coordinated strategies to improve this area of healthcare. A lack of clarity in defining the pharmacists’ role in this area and a disconnect between current regulatory standards and education/training system were the prominent themes. Participants looked towards the government to facilitate actions in the development of policies that support pharmacy practice and practice guidelines, and the review of competency standards, and registration criteria as being the most important enablers. Conclusion Guiding principles that outline standards for pharmacy practice regarding HMs in an integrated healthcare system are considered a priority, requiring a joint effort from the government, professional organizations and universities.","Yao, Dongning; Hu, Hao; Harnett, Joanna E.; Ung, Carolina Oi Lam",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29

Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in China hardest-hit areas during COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the gender difference existing in PTSS. One month after the December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, we surveyed PTSS and sleep qualities among 285 residents in Wuhan and surrounding cities using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Hierarchical regression analysis and non-parametric test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%. Women reported significant higher PTSS in the domains of re-experiencing, negative alterations in cognition or mood, and hyper-arousal. Participants with better sleep quality or less frequency of early awakenings reported lower PTSS. Professional and effective mental health services should be designed in order to aid the psychological wellbeing of the population in affected areas, especially those living in hardest-hit areas, females and people with poor sleep quality.","Liu, Nianqi; Zhang, Fan; Wei, Cun; Jia, Yanpu; Shang, Zhilei; Sun, Luna; Wu, Lili; Sun, Zhuoer; Zhou, Yaoguang; Wang, Yan; Liu, Weizhi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

4024,40 Group A Streptococcus,"Abstract Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes, affects an estimated 800 million people each year. Most of the resulting estimated 639,000 annual deaths are related to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and its complications. Resource-limited areas account for the vast majority of cases, although outbreaks still occur in industrialized countries. GAS has several mechanisms to avoid phagocytosis, including prevention of opsonization and the use of surface proteins to block complement fixation. The mechanisms behind the immunologic phenomenon are not well understood. Clinical presentations range from benign, short-lived impetigo or pharyngitis through to lifelong RHD. In its most invasive form, GAS can cause a rapidly progressive, often lethal infection: streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. S. pyogenes remains universally sensitive to penicillin, which is the mainstay of treatment.","Hand, Robert M.; Snelling, Thomas L.; Carapetis, Jonathan R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Since that time, Italy and nations throughout the world have adopted very stringent and severe measures to protect populations from spread of infection. Despite these measures, the number of infected people is growing exponentially, with a significant number of patients developing acute respiratory insufficiency. Endoscopy departments face significant risk for diffusion of respiratory diseases that can be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the measures, with specific focus on personal protection equipment and dress code modalities, implemented in our hospital to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 infection.","Repici, Alessandro; Maselli, Roberta; Colombo, Matteo; Gabbiadini, Roberto; Spadaccini, Marco; Anderloni, Andrea; Carrara, Silvia; Fugazza, Alessandro; Di Leo, Milena; Galtieri, Piera Alessia; Pellegatta, Gaia; Ferrara, Elisa Chiara; Azzolini, Elena; Lagioia, Michele",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gie.2020.03.019,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14
4026,Blocking drug-induced autophagy with chloroquine in HCT-116 colon cancer cells enhances DC maturation and T cell responses induced by tumor cell lysate,"Abstract Autophagy is an important mechanism for tumor escape, allowing tumor cells to recover from the damage induced by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy and contributing to the development of resistance. The pharmacological inhibition of autophagy contributes to increase the efficacy of antineoplastic agents. Exposing tumor cells to low concentrations of select autophagy-inducing antineoplastic agents increases their immunogenicity and enhances their ability to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation. We tested whether the application of an autophagy-inhibiting agent, chloroquine (CQ), in combination with low concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) increases the ability of tumor cells to induce DC maturation. DCs sensitized with the lysate of HCT-116 cells previously exposed to such a combination enhanced the DC maturation/activation ability. These matured DCs also increased the allogeneic responsiveness of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which showed a greater proliferative response than those from DCs sensitized with control lysates. The T cells expanded in such cocultures were CD69+ and PD-1- and produced higher levels of IFN-γ and lower levels of IL-10, consistent with the preferential activation of Th1 cells. Cocultures of autologous DCs and lymphocytes improved the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as assessed by the expression of CD107a, perforin, and granzyme B. The drug combination increased the expression of genes related to the CEACAM family (BECN1, ATGs, MAPLC3B, ULK1, SQSTM1) and tumor suppressors (PCBP1). Furthermore, the decreased expression of genes related to metastasis and tumor progression (BNIP3, BNIP3L, FOSL2, HES1, LAMB3, LOXL2, NDRG1, P4HA1, PIK3R2) was noted. The combination of 5-FU and CQ increases the ability of tumor cells to drive DC maturation and enhances the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell responses.","Zamame Ramirez, Jofer Andree; Romagnoli, Graziela Gorete; Falasco, Bianca Francisco; Gorgulho, Carolina Mendonça; Sanzochi Fogolin, Carla; dos Santos, Daniela Carvalho; Junior, João Pessoa Araújo; Lotze, Michael Thomas; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes; Kaneno, Ramon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106495,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106495,Elsevier,10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106495,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

The only mammals capable of self-powered flying, many can catch insects in complete darkness, using sophisticated echolocation. They are ecologically important in controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees, distributing seeds, and are widely eaten. Many viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites have been isolated from bats. In some cases, direct bat-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Lyssavirus infections transmissible to humans by bats include classic rabies, Duvenhage, European bat lyssaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) transmit classic rabies to humans and domestic animals in Latin America. Insectivorous and frugivorous bats are vectors or reservoirs of at least five Lyssaviruses species, Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), Henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), and some other viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Bat-transmitted rabies infections can be prevented by vaccination. Vampire bat rabies can be controlled by vaccinating the bats or killing them with anti-coagulants.","Warrell, David A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Consequently, the host’s immune system devotes enormous resources to the defense of these tissues. Although mucosal immune responses must be sufficiently strong to eliminate pathogens, they must also have mechanisms to prevent excessive inflammation and initiate epithelial repair. Importantly, mucosal immune responses are initiated and regulated by a variety of mucosal lymphoid tissues, collectively known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This chapter describes the unique developmental, architectural, and functional features of the MALT and how those features facilitate the local immune response at each site.","Silva-Sanchez, Aaron; Randall, Troy D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services and systems are a new initiative from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that seeks to provide science-based integrated urban services supporting safe, healthy and resilient cities. Various cities have already started development and implementation of such Integrated Urban Services and successfully test and use them following specific requirements of local stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS) from a set of four case study cities: Hong Kong, Toronto, Mexico City and Paris, that use different IUS configurations with good existing practice. These cities represent a range of countries, climates and geophysical settings. The aggregate main joint similarities of the IUS in these cities and synergy of the cities' experience, achievements and research findings are presented, as well as identification of existing gaps in knowledge and further research needs. A list of potential criteria for identifying and classifying IUS demonstration cities is proposed.

4038,Chapter 4 Molecular Modeling of Major Structural Protein Genes of Avian Coronavirus: Infectious Bronchitis Virus Mass H120 and Italy02 Strains,"Abstract In Morocco, the epidemiological situation of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is very complex, because of the antigenic diversity associated with the emergence of new serotypes/genotypes and variants. The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010–14. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.","Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4039,A delayed vaccinated epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and Lévy jumps,"Abstract A stochastic susceptible–infectious–recovered epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate is formulated to discuss the effects of temporary immunity, vaccination, and Le.́vy jumps on the transmission of diseases. We first determine the existence of a unique global positive solution and a positively invariant set for the stochastic system. Sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence in the mean of the disease are then achieved by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, we conclude that noise intensity and the validity period of vaccination greatly influence the transmission dynamics of the system.","Fan, Kuangang; Zhang, Yan; Gao, Shujing; Chen, Shihua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,Elsevier,10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

4041,Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer,"In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.","Lombardi, Andrea; Bozzi, Giorgio; Mangioni, Davide; Muscatello, Antonio; Peri, Anna Maria; Taramasso, Lucia; Ungaro, Riccardo; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003,Elsevier,MA ID 3005788786,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
4042,Antiviral Innate Immunity: Introduction ☆,"Abstract The concept of “innate immunity” includes all sorts of measures that exclude, inhibit, or slow down infections with little specificity and without much adaptation or generation of a long-lasting memory. The mammalian innate immune defenses described in this article comprise defensins, the complement system, nonspecific phagocytic and cytolytic leukocytes, and cytokines such as the antivirally active interferons. Since the type I (IFN-α/β) and type III interferon (IFN-λ) systems are our primary defense against viral infections, special attention will be paid to the virus-triggered induction of IFN transcription, the signaling activated by IFNs, and the antiviral factors expressed as a consequence.","Weber, Friedemann",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Materials and methods In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy). Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on Pubmed and Embase databases. Results Fifty-eight patients (36 men, 22 women; age range, 18–98 years) were included in the study. Among these, chest US, CXR, and CT were performed respectively in twenty-two, thirty-two and forty-two patients. Lung US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (100%) and subpleural consolidations (27.3%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (46.9%) and hazy increased opacities (37.5%). Typical CT features included bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) with (59.5%) and without (35.7%) consolidations having a predominantly peripheral distribution (64.3%). Other imaging features included crazy paving pattern (57.1%), fibrous stripes (50%), subpleural lines (35.7%), architectural distortion (28.6%), air bronchogram sign (26.2%), vascular thickening (23.8%) and nodules (2.4%). Also, enlarged lymph nodes (14.3 %) and pleural effusion (7.1%) were observed. The literature review identified twenty-six original studies supporting our imaging chest findings. Conclusion The spectrum of chest imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission includes B-lines and consolidations on US, consolidations and hazy increased opacities on CXR, and multifocal GGO with consolidations on CT.","Lomoro, Pascal; Verde, Francesco; Zerboni, Filippo; Simonetti, Igino; Borghi, Claudia; Fachinetti, Camilla; Natalizi, Anna; Martegani, Alberto",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100231,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100231,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100231,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4046,Central nervous system manifestations of COVID-19: A systematic review,"Abstract Objective In this systematic review, we will discuss the evidence on the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Methods MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: “COVID 19” OR “coronavirus” AND “brain” OR “CNS” OR “neurologic”. Results Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. Conclusion While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A.; Simani, Leila",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116832,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116832,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jns.2020.116832,15/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-15
4047,Public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in a coastal metropolis of Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Disaster risk reduction is an increasingly important policy issue, especially in developing countries that suffer most of the global human and economic losses associated with disasters. Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n = 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) = 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) = 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.","AlQahtany, Ali M.; Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Le service accueille plus de 2200 patients annuellement, en moyenne pour 4 jours. Le taux de mortalité est de 7,5 % en 2019 pour un SAPS2 moyen de 44 points. Une quatrième unité, non-géographique celle-là, s’occupe des besoins spécifiques des patients « long séjour » et de leurs proches ainsi que de la consultation post-réanimation, 6 et 12 mois après l’hospitalisation. Les infirmières sont spécialisées en soins intensifs et s’occupent en moyenne d’1,5 patients la journée et de 2 patients la nuit. Le service est un centre de formation pour les intensivistes suisses et un centre de recherche clinique de qualité. Summary The University Hospitals of Geneva is the largest hospital complex in Switzerland and is coupled to the Faculty of medicine of the University of Geneva. The division of adult intensive care is a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU, made of three different units: one neurocritical care unit, one cardiovascular unit, and one polyvalent unit receiving patients that do not fit into the two previous units. More than 2200 patients are hospitalised yearly in the division of adult intensive care, staying a mean of 4 days. The ICU mortality rate is 7.5% for a mean SAPS2 of 44 points. A fourth non-geographical unit with dedicated doctors and nurses is dedicated to the specific needs of “long-stayers” and their next of kin and to the organisation of post-ICU clinics, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. Nurses follow a special ICU training of 2 years, and obtain an ICU nurse certificate. One nurse takes care of 1.5 patients during the day and 2 patients during night shifts.

Case 2 was discharged from isolation in hospital after having one negative test result on Jan 28 (11 days after returning from Wuhan). Following discharge, the patient attended a family social function. 2 days later, she was readmitted after a second nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken during her time in hospital was reported as positive. Screening of 79 individuals who had been in contact with these two patients (namely, family members in the same household and anyone who had been within 2 m of them) was initiated on Jan 31. Six individuals from the same work team, who had also travelled from Wuhan on Jan 17, were isolated, and four of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3, 4, and 8 in Vinh Phuc, and one case from another province). Five secondary cases were diagnosed within the social network of case 2.

4061,21 Microbiology,"Abstract The management and containment of many treatable and preventable infectious diseases in resource-poor countries is limited by the failure to make an accurate diagnosis. Most of the world's population lacks access to accurate, affordable, easy-to-use, quality-assured, reliable, and accessible diagnostic tests and misdiagnosis of infectious diseases is common and compromises patient care. Laboratory diagnostics are also needed for the detection and surveillance of the increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Accurate clinical diagnosis in resource-poor settings relies strongly on the laboratory service, and the need to support the development of a quality-assured laboratory service in such settings is increasingly recognized. International organizations are actively working with local and national providers to improve laboratory services. The development of laboratory services will contribute to improved health for the local population, protection against emerging pathogens, and ensure better use of scarce health care resources.","Parry, Christopher M.; Peacock, Sharon J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

4064,Why is it difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 epidemic?,"Abstract Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019, numerous model predictions on the COVID-19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been reported. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city.","Roda, Weston C.; Varughese, Marie B.; Han, Donglin; Li, Michael Y.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

4066,Chapter 46 Harnessing γδ T Cells as Natural Immune Modulators,"Abstract There has been renewed interest in harnessing the power of the immune system as a countermeasure against infectious pathogens and cancers. One immune cell target in the development of these approaches is the γδ T cell. These cells are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against infectious agents and cancers, and they migrate to, and reside in, mucosal tissues. γδ T cells exhibit a broad array of natural (or constitutive) and induced effector functions, including antigen presentation, that can be fine-tuned depending on their stimulation. They express unique antigen receptors as well as nonantigen, innate immune type surface receptors that can be targeted. In this chapter, we will review the biology and the basis for use of γδ T cells as a therapeutic target. We will then summarize novel plant- and microbe-derived materials that enhance γδ T cell activity in animal models and humans that can be used as a new strategy for mucosal vaccine development.","Hedges, Jodi F.; Jutila, Mark A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4067,1 Tropical Lung Diseases,"Abstract Lung disease is common in the tropics; lower respiratory tract infections are a major cause of mortality, especially in children under 5 years of age. The World Health Organization has launched strategies to tackle this killer of children. Infections, including tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, find vulnerable hosts in the tropics where human immunodeficiency virus co-infection is widespread, especially in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Parasitic infections can cause pulmonary manifestations (e.g., pleural effusion and cavitary lesions). Blood and pulmonary eosinophilia are common in such infections. Non-communicable lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer associated with tobacco use, contribute to mortality, particularly where there is poor access to health structures.","Papanikolaou, Ilias C.; Tsenempi, Xenia A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4068,Clinical and CT imaging features of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),"Tang JW, et al. and colleagues have written to this Journal describing the emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 We have had an opportunity to examine in detail the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in cases with microbiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, to familiarize radiologists and clinicians with the imaging manifestations of this new outbreak. Meanwhile, we also studied the clinical characteristics of the cases, combined with CT manifestations, to provide more clues for the correct diagnosis of the disease. Six female patients (P1-P6) aged from 27 to 63 years were referred to the fever clinic of our hospital. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, malignant tumour or respiratory disease. Among the 6 cases, 5 (P1-P5) had a history of exposure to Wuhan or Hubei, and P6 had no clear epidemiological history. All the patients performed oropharyngeal swabs test and confirmed as COVID-19. Common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative. For patients’ venous blood tests at disease onset, as given in (Table 1), we found that leucocytes, lymphocytes and percentage were slightly decreased or normal, eosinophil count and percentage were slightly decreased in 4 cases and normal in 2 cases. Additionally, 4 days later, P1 reperformed the follow-up hematologic examination. Compared with the blood test at disease onset, the results showed that the eosinophil count was still below the normal range, which was even lower than the first time.","Zhu, Ying; Liu, Yang-Li; Li, Zi-Ping; Kuang, Jian-Yi; Li, Xiang-Min; Yang, You-You; Feng, Shi-Ting",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.022,Elsevier,MA ID 3005929298,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03

The feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations. Therefore, an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination, motion, skin tone, and distance variance. The experiment was conducted for two main scenarios; human-computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance. The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error. The heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error, standard deviation; root means square error and Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings of this experiment inferred promising results for health monitoring of subjects standing at a distance of 500 cm.","Hassan, M.A.; Malik, A.S.; Fofi, D.; Karasfi, B.; Meriaudeau, F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

4075,Investigation of interunit dispersion in 2D street canyons: A scaled outdoor experiment,"Abstract Interunit dispersion problems have been studied previously mainly through on-site measurements, wind tunnel tests, and CFD simulations. In this study, a scaled outdoor experiment was conducted to examine the interunit dispersion characteristics in consecutive two-dimensional street canyons. Tracer gas ( C O 2 ) was continuously released to simulate the pollutant dispersion routes between the rooms in street canyons. The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. In addition, under real weather conditions, the rooms in the street canyon have a high probability of experiencing a high reentry ratio based on the maximum reentry ratio of each room. This study provides authentic airflow and pollutant dispersion information in the street canyons in an urban environment. The dataset of this experiment can be used to validate further numerical simulations.","Dai, Yuwei; Mak, Cheuk Ming; Zhang, Yong; Cui, Dongjin; Hang, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,Elsevier,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
4076,Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study,"Abstract Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.","Liu, Kai; Zhang, Weitong; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Jinpeng; Li, Yunqian; Chen, Ying",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

4082,Consistency analysis of COVID-19 nucleic acid tests and the changes of lung CT,"Abstract Background COVID-19, the latest outbreak of infectious disease, has caused huge medical challenges to China and the entire globe. No unified diagnostic standard has been formulated. The initial diagnosis remains based on the positive of nucleic acid tests. However, early nucleic acid tests were identified to be negative in some patients, whereas the patients exhibited characteristic CT changes of lung, and positive test results appeared after repeated nucleic acid tests, having caused the failure to diagnose these patients early. The study aimed to delve into the relationships between initial nucleic acid testing and early lung CT changes in patients with COVID-19. Method In accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, 69 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in the infected V ward of Xiaogan Central Hospital from 2020/1/25 to 2020/2/6 were retrospectively analyzed. The consistency between the first COVID-19 nucleic acid test positive and lung CT changes was studied. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT and initial nucleic acid were studied. Result The Kappa coefficient of initial nucleic acid positive changes and lung CT changes was −1.52. With a positive nucleic acid test as the gold standard, the sensitivity of lung CT was 12.00 %, 95 % CI: 4.6–24.3; with the changes of CT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of nucleic acid positive was 30.16 %, 95 % CI: 19.2−43.0. Conclusion The consistency between the initial positive nucleic acid test and the CT changes in the lungs is poor; low sensitivity was achieved for initial nucleic acid detection and CT changes.","Zhifeng, Jiang; Feng, Aiqiao; Li, Tao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104359,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104359,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104359,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
4083,Chapter 7 Long-term virus evolution in nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another facet of biological complexity.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4084,Clinical Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by Epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) Infection: A Hint for COVID-19 Treatment,"Abstract H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts and carry the risk of human-to-human transmission, as shown by the 2013 outbreak. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Chen, Jiajia; Hu, Chenxia; Chen, Lijun; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Yixin; Xu, Xiaowei; Chen, Lu; Gao, Hainv; Lu, Xiaoqing; Yu, Liang; Dai, Xiahong; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,28/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-28

The results can be used for invention of H1N1 sensor, which provide rapid, label-free and low-cost detection of influenza.","Gongalsky, M.B.; Tsurikova, U.A.; Samsonova, J.V.; Gvindzhiliiia, G.Z.; Gonchar, K.A.; Saushkin, N.

4088,8 Epidemic modeling and control of HIV/AIDS dynamics in populations under external interactions: A worldwide challenge,"Abstract In this chapter the problem of the interaction between groups of subjects singularly characterized by a specific infectious disease is addressed. The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals. These effects have been reported in numerous figures showing the results of numerical simulations.","Di Giamberardino, Paolo; Iacoviello, Daniela",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

4090,Insurance uptake among small and medium-sized tourism and hospitality enterprises in a resource-scarce environment,"Abstract Small and medium-sized tourism and hospitality enterprises (SMTHEs) are often susceptible to various hazards, which result in risk concerns. Insurance is recognised as one of the risk management strategies, but evidence indicates that insurance uptake among SMTHEs has been low. Yet, researchers have hardly researched into the factors that influence insurance uptake among SMTHEs. Two-hundred and fifty (250) respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique. Confirmatory factor analysis, multivariate logit and probit regression techniques were used to determine factors underlying SMTHEs' insurance uptake. Risk concerns, the firm's characteristics, the perceived benefits of insurance and other informal risk coping mechanisms, as well as insurance service provision concerns were identified as determinants of insurance uptake. This is one of the first papers to offer a holistic understanding of the factors influencing SMTHEs' insurance subscription in a resource-scarce destination of Sub-Saharan Africa. The practical and theoretical implications of the paper are discussed.","Dayour, Frederick; Adongo, Charles A.; Kimbu, Albert N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

4094,Chapter 14 The use of host factors in microbial forensics,"Abstract Advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator, and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response to microbial antigens including vaccine-induced immunity and detection of antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. This chapter presents central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a representative example, which, in the appropriate context, has a high potential of providing evidence that may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim. This chapter also presents information about the immune system so that the interested reader can have a fuller understanding of the immune response in general.","Schutzer, Steven E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
4095,A precision medicine approach to managing 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible—or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.","Wang, Minjin; Zhou, Yanbing; Zong, Zhiyong; Liang, Zongan; Cao, Yu; Tang, Hong; Song, Bin; Huang, Zixing; Kang, Yan; Feng, Ping; Ying, Binwu; Li, Weimin",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa002,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107203/,PMC,MA ID 3006495046,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04
