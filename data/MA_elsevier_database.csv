1,Hunters Searching among Starry Nights and at the Edges of Life,,"Breedlove, Byron",https://www.doi.org/10.3201/eid2601.ac2601,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6924909/,PMC,10.3201/eid2601.ac2601,10/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-10
2,Safety of prone positioning in critically ill patients,"Background: During the past two years, 5% of patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Hamad General Hospital (HGH) had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 ± 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 ± 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 ± 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: • Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. • Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. • Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. • Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.","Akbar, Anzila; Albadw, Naseem; Racela, Brian; Damodaran, Chokkalinga; Mustafa, Emad; Coria, Roopa; Hassan, Ali; Saif Ibrahim, Abdulsalam",https://www.doi.org/10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984011/,PMC,10.5339/qmj.2019.qccc.60,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27

4,Social Responses to Epidemics Depicted by Cinema,"Films illustrate 2 ways that epidemics can affect societies: fear leading to a breakdown in sociability and fear stimulating preservation of tightly held social norms. The first response is often informed by concern over perceived moral failings within society, the second response by the application of arbitrary or excessive controls from outside the community.","Han, Qijun; Curtis, Daniel R.",https://www.doi.org/10.3201/eid2602.181022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6986850/,PMC,10.3201/eid2602.181022,10/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-10
5,The Epidemiology of Primary Central Nervous System Tumors at the National Neurologic Institute in Saudi Arabia: A Ten-Year Single-Institution Study,"OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at describing the epidemiological trends of primary CNS tumors in children and adults at the National Neurologic Institute in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological approach was used where data was obtained from the department of pathology registry files and pathology reports. The records of all patients registered from January 2005 to December 2014 with a diagnosis of primary CNS tumor (brain and spinal cord) were selected. Data about sex, age, tumor location, and histologic type were collected. The classification was based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3). RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-two (992) cases of primary CNS tumors throughout the ten years (2005 to 2014) were reviewed. There were 714 (71.97%) adults and 278 (28.02%) in the pediatric age group. Nonmalignant tumors dominated the adult population (60.08%) while malignant tumors were more frequent in the pediatric population. Gliomas constituted the most common neoplastic category in children and adults. The most common single tumor entity was meningioma (26.99%, ICD-O-3 histology codes 9530/0, 9539/1, and 9530/3). Medulloblastomas (ICD-O-3 histology codes 9470, 9471, and 9474) were the most common single tumor entity in the pediatric age group (26.62%). CONCLUSIONS: This is an institution-based, detailed, and descriptive epidemiological study of patients with primary CNS tumors in Saudi Arabia. In contrast to other regional and international studies, the medulloblastomas in our institution are more frequent than pilocytic astrocytomas. Limitations to our study included the referral bias and histology-based methodology.","Almutrafi, Amna; Bashawry, Yara; AlShakweer, Wafaa; Al-Harbi, Musa; Altwairgi, Abdullah; Al-Dandan, Sadeq",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/1429615,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044490/,PMC,10.1155/2020/1429615,15/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-15

7,A nationwide survey of psychological distress among Chinese people in the COVID-19 epidemic: implications and policy recommendations,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, spread nationwide and then onto half a dozen other countries between December 2019 and early 2020. The implementation of unprecedented strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation and affected many aspects of people’s lives. It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. This study is the first nationwide large-scale survey of psychological distress in the general population of China during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Qiu, Jianyin; Shen, Bin; Zhao, Min; Wang, Zhen; Xie, Bin; Xu, Yifeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7061893/,PMC,10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
8,Early warning of some notifiable infectious diseases in China by the artificial neural network,"In order to accurately grasp the timing for the prevention and control of diseases, we established an artificial neural network model to issue early warning signals. The real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods were performed to analyse four types of respiratory infectious diseases and four types of digestive tract infectious diseases in China to comprehensively determine the epidemic intensities and whether to issue early warning signals. The numbers of new confirmed cases per month between January 2004 and December 2017 were used as the training set; the data from 2018 were used as the test set. The results of RTRL showed that the number of new confirmed cases of respiratory infectious diseases in September 2018 increased abnormally. The results of the EKF showed that the number of new confirmed cases of respiratory infectious diseases increased abnormally in January and February of 2018. The results of these two algorithms showed that the number of new confirmed cases of digestive tract infectious diseases in the test set did not have any abnormal increases. The neural network and machine learning can further enrich and develop the early warning theory.","Guo, Zuiyuan; He, Kevin; Xiao, Dan",https://www.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191420,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062078/,PMC,10.1098/rsos.191420,19/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-19
9,"iCa(2+) Flux, ROS and IL-10 Determines Cytotoxic, and Suppressor T Cell Functions in Chronic Human Viral Infections","Exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells and increased IL-10 production is well-known in chronic viral infections but mechanisms leading to loss of their cytotoxic capabilities and consequent exhaustion remain unclear. Exhausted CD8(+)T cells also called T suppressors are highly immune suppressive with altered T cell receptor signaling characteristics that mark it exclusively from their cytotoxic counterparts. Our study found that iCa(2+) flux is reduced following T cell receptor activation in T suppressor cells when compared to their effector counterpart. Importantly chronic activation of murine cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells lead to reduced iCa(2+) influx, decreased IFN-γ and enhanced IL-10 production and this profile is mimicked in Tc1 cells upon reduction of iCa(2+) flux by extracellular calcium channel inhibitors. Further reduced iCa(2+) flux induced ROS which lead to IFN-γ reduction and increased IL-10 producing T suppressors through the STAT3—STAT5 axis. The above findings were substantiated by our human data where reduced iCa(2+) flux in chronic Hepatitis infections displayed CD8(+) T cells with low IFN-γ and increased IL-10 production. Importantly treatment with an antioxidant led to increased IFN-γ and reduced IL-10 production in human chronic Hep-B/C samples suggesting overall a proximal regulatory role for iCa(2+) influx, ROS, and IL-10 in determining the effector/ suppressive axis of CD8(+) T cells.","Mohanty, Subhasmita; Barik, Prakash; Debata, Nagen; Nagarajan, Perumal; Devadas, Satish",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00083,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068714/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00083,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
10,Bluetongue Serotype 3 in Israel 2013–2018: Clinical Manifestations of the Disease and Molecular Characterization of Israeli Strains,"In this paper, the results of the diagnostic activities on Bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) conducted at Kimron Veterinary Institute (Beit Dagan, Israel) between 2013 and 2018 are reported. Bluetongue virus is the causative agent of bluetongue (BT), a disease of ruminants, mostly transmitted by competent Culicoides species. In Israel, BTV-3 circulation was first detected in 2013 from a sheep showing classical BT clinical signs. It was also evidenced in 2016, and, since then, it has been regularly detected in Israeli livestock. Between 2013 and 2017, BTV-3 outbreaks were limited in sheep flocks located in the southern area only. In 2018, BTV-3 was instead found in the Israeli coastal area being one of the dominant BTV serotypes isolated from symptomatic sheep, cattle and goats. In Israeli sheep, BTV-3 was able to cause BT classical clinical manifestations and fatalities, while in cattle and goats infection ranged from asymptomatic forms to death cases, depending on either general welfare of the herds or on the occurrence of viral and bacterial co-infections. Three different BTV-3 strains were identified in Israel between 2013 and 2018: ISR-2019/13 isolated in 2013, ISR-2153/16 and ISR-2262/2/16 isolated in 2016. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of these strains showed more than 99% identity by segment (Seg) 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 sequences. In contrast, a wide range of diversity among these strains was exhibited in other viral gene segments, implying the occurrence of genome reassortment between these local circulating strains and those originating from Africa. The genome sequences of the BTV-3 isolated in 2017 and 2018 were most closely related to those of the ISR-2153/16 strain suggesting their common ancestor. Comparison of BTV-3 Israeli strains with those recently detected in the Mediterranean region uncovered high percentage identity (98.19–98.28%) only between Seg-2 of all Israeli strains and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. A 98.93% identity was also observed between Seg-4 sequences of ISR-2019/13 and the BTV-3 Zarzis/TUN2016 strain. This study demonstrated that BTV-3 has been circulating in the Mediterranean region at least since 2013, but, unlike the other Mediterranean strains, Israeli BTV-3 were able to cause clinical signs also in cattle.","Golender, Natalia; Bumbarov, Velizar; Eldar, Avi; Lorusso, Alessio; Kenigswald, Gabriel; Varsano, Joseph Seffi; David, Dan; Schainin, Shani; Dagoni, Ilan; Gur, Iosef; Kaplan, Alon; Gorohov, Anna; Koren, Ori; Oron, Eldad; Khinich, Yevgeny; Sclamovich, Ily; Meir, Abraham; Savini, Giovanni",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00112,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068852/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00112,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
11,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Infusion Shows Promise for Combating Coronavirus (COVID-19)- Induced Pneumonia,"A new study published by the journal Aging & Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020). This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.","Shetty, Ashok K",https://www.doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0301,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069463/,PMC,10.14336/ad.2020.0301,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09
12,Transplantation of ACE2(-) Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves the Outcome of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,"A coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","Leng, Zikuan; Zhu, Rongjia; Hou, Wei; Feng, Yingmei; Yang, Yanlei; Han, Qin; Shan, Guangliang; Meng, Fanyan; Du, Dongshu; Wang, Shihua; Fan, Junfen; Wang, Wenjing; Deng, Luchan; Shi, Hongbo; Li, Hongjun; Hu, Zhongjie; Zhang, Fengchun; Gao, Jinming; Liu, Hongjian; Li, Xiaoxia; Zhao, Yangyang; Yin, Kan; He, Xijing; Gao, Zhengchao; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Bo; Jin, Ronghua; Stambler, Ilia; Lim, Lee Wei; Su, Huanxing; Moskalev, Alexey; Cano, Antonio; Chakrabarti, Sasanka; Min, Kyung-Jin; Ellison-Hughes, Georgina; Caruso, Calogero; Jin, Kunlin; Zhao, Robert Chunhua",https://www.doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.0228,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069465/,PMC,10.14336/ad.2020.0228,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09

14,Deep Learning-Based Method of Diagnosing Hyperlipidemia and Providing Diagnostic Markers Automatically,"INTRODUCTION: The research of auxiliary diagnosis has always been one of the hotspots in the world. The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor’s diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. RESULTS: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. DISCUSSION: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.","Liu, Yuliang; Zhang, Quan; Zhao, Geng; Liu, Guohua; Liu, Zhiang",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s242585,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7073442/,PMC,10.2147/dmso.s242585,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11
15,Drug targets for corona virus: A systematic review,"The 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a major source of disaster in the 21(th) century. However, the lack of specific drugs to prevent/treat an attack is a major need at this current point of time. In this regard, we conducted a systematic review to identify major druggable targets in coronavirus (CoV). We searched PubMed and RCSB database with keywords HCoV, NCoV, corona virus, SERS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV, crystal structure, X-ray crystallography structure, NMR structure, target, and drug target till Feb 3, 2020. The search identified seven major targets (spike protein, envelop protein, membrane protein, protease, nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin esterase, and helicase) for which drug design can be considered. There are other 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which can also be considered from the drug design perspective. The major structural proteins and NSPs may serve an important role from drug design perspectives. However, the occurrence of frequent recombination events is a major deterrent factor toward the development of CoV-specific vaccines/drugs.","Prajapat, Manisha; Sarma, Phulen; Shekhar, Nishant; Avti, Pramod; Sinha, Shweta; Kaur, Hardeep; Kumar, Subodh; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Harish; Bansal, Seema; Medhi, Bikash",https://www.doi.org/10.4103/ijp.ijp_115_20,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074424/,PMC,10.4103/ijp.ijp_115_20,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

17,Role of changes in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor: An in silico analysis,"Many human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event. Some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of morbidity/mortality in humans. Changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species. The most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the Covid-19 epidemics caused by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. An in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the S1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. The observed changes have significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike/ACE2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the Bat-CoV to this receptor. The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2. This could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.","Ortega, Joseph Thomas; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Pujol, Flor Helene; Rangel, Hector Rafael",https://www.doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-1167,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081066/,PMC,10.17179/excli2020-1167,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18
18,Unrevealing sequence and structural features of novel coronavirus using in silico approaches: The main protease as molecular target,"Direct-acting antivirals are effective tools to control viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus associated with the epidemiological outbreak in late 2019. Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease. Based on that and using an in silico approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect. Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated. Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features. Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.","Ortega, Joseph Thomas; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Pujol, Flor Helene; Rangel, Hector Rafael",https://www.doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-1189,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081067/,PMC,10.17179/excli2020-1189,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17
19,"A Novel CDC42 Mutation in an 11-Year Old Child Manifesting as Syndromic Immunodeficiency, Autoinflammation, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, and Malignancy: A Case Report","Background: The CDC42 (Cell Division Cycle 42) gene product, CDC42, is a member of the family of small Rho GTPases, which are implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological functions in cell cycle regulation, including establishing and controlling of the cell actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, cell polarity, proliferation, motility and migration, transcription activation, reactive oxygen species production, and tumorigenesis. The CDC42 gene mutations are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental, growth, hematological, and immunological disturbances. Case presentation: We report the case of an 11-year-old boy with syndromic features, immunodeficiency, and autoinflammation who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and malignant lymphoproliferation. In this patient, a novel heterozygous p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene was found by whole exome sequencing. Conclusions: The Cdc42 molecule plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and a wide array of tissue-specific functions, and its deregulation may result in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular dysfunctions, making patients with CDC42 gene mutations susceptible to infections, immune dysregulation, and malignancy. In the patient studied, a syndromic phenotype with facial dysmorphism, neurodevelopmental delay, immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shares common features with Takenouchi–Kosaki syndrome and with C-terminal variants in CDC42. It is important to emphasize that Hodgkin's lymphoma is described for the first time in the medical literature in a pediatric patient with the novel p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene.

It is highly necessary for healthcare providers (HCPs) to have sufficient knowledge about such a disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge regarding ZIKV among HCPs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, KSA, during a two-month period from September 19, 2016 to November 19, 2016. Descriptive statistics were performed on data collected. For continuous variables, data were expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs), medians, and ranges. Proportions were used to describe categorical variables. Knowledge scores were evaluated and compared by demographic characteristics including age, designation, years of practice, and gender, using the t-test/Mann–Whitney U test or the Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 336 HCPs from different specialties (physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists) completed the questionnaire. Significant differences in knowledge about ZIKV were observed by participant's age. Significantly higher knowledge levels were observed among older participants (45 years or more; p=0.011). A substantial difference in the knowledge level was observed by department, with pairwise comparisons showing significant differences in knowledge scores between all departments except for Pharmacy vs. Nutrition and Nursing vs. Internal Medicine. Knowledge scores were not significantly different by years of practice. CONCLUSION: Our study showed inadequate knowledge of HCPs from different specialties about ZIKV infection which needs to be improved in terms of infection prevention and control. Awareness about ZIKV infection should be ensured and maintained among HCPs to face any possible emergence in the region.","Alessa, Mohammed; Alzahrani, Mohammed; Alshehri, Abdulmajeed; Aljrboa, Amjad; Bustami, Rami; Almangour, Abdullah; Alsalem, Abdulaziz; Gramish, Jawaher; Khobrani, Moteb; Almangour, Thamer A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/8145219,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086415/,PMC,10.1155/2020/8145219,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11
21,Clinical and Pathogenic Characteristics of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection Treated at the Vietnam National Children's Hospital,"Lower respiratory tract infections are commonly caused by viruses and cause significant morbidity and mortality among children. Early identification of the pathological agent causing these infections is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and improve patient management. Multiplex PCR techniques were recently developed to detect multiple viral pathogens using a single PCR reaction. In this study, we identify viral pathogens in children with respiratory infections. We collected 194 nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants (2–24 months old) with lower respiratory tract infections treated at the Vietnam National Children's Hospital between November 2014 and June 2015 and assessed the presence of 16 virus types and subtypes by multiplex PCR using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) assay. Overall, 73.7% of the samples were positive for at least one virus, and 24.2% corresponded to infections with multiple viruses. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus. These viruses were more frequent among younger patients (2–5 months old) and caused symptoms similar to those of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The most common clinical manifestation caused by respiratory tract infection was bronchiolitis. Elevated neutrophils levels were associated with adenovirus infection. Our results showed that the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) can effectively detect multiple viruses causing respiratory infections in children and that the nasopharyngeal aspirates are a good sample choice to detect respiratory viruses in children. Applying this approach in the clinical setting would improve patient management and allow early diagnosis, thus avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","Pham, Hien T.; Nguyen, Phuc T.

22,Organoids as a Powerful Model for Respiratory Diseases,"Insults to the alveoli usually lead to inefficient gas exchange or even respiratory failure, which is difficult to model in animal studies. Over the past decade, stem cell-derived self-organizing three-dimensional organoids have emerged as a new avenue to recapitulate respiratory diseases in a dish. Alveolar organoids have improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and pathological alterations in alveoli. From this perspective, we review the state-of-the-art technology on establishing alveolar organoids from endogenous lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells or pluripotent stem cells, as well as the use of alveolar organoids for the study of respiratory diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis infection, and respiratory virus infection. We also discuss challenges that need to be overcome for future application of alveolar organoids in individualized medicine.","Li, Yu; Wu, Qi; Sun, Xin; Shen, Jun; Chen, Huaiyong",https://www.doi.org/10.1155/2020/5847876,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086445/,PMC,10.1155/2020/5847876,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

24,Tandem CTCF sites function as insulators to balance spatial chromatin contacts and topological enhancer-promoter selection,"BACKGROUND: CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem. RESULTS: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin “loop extrusion” model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.","Jia, Zhilian; Li, Jingwei; Ge, Xiao; Wu, Yonghu; Guo, Ya; Wu, Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-01984-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087399/,PMC,10.1186/s13059-020-01984-7,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

In response to the current global health event, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Mass gatherings present a historic challenge in protecting the health and safety of attendees. The majority of the prominent mass gatherings are religious in nature. Global sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, pose unique health risks to attendees and host nations. Deferment or cancellation of such mass gatherings may exert an extraordinary economic loss to the host nation.

30,In Preparation for Outdoor Pharming: Griffithsin Can Be Expressed in Nicotiana excelsiana and Retains Activity After Storage as Silage,"Griffithsin is an algae-derived lectin with strong anti-viral activity against HIV and a positive safety profile. Multiple clinical studies are investigating griffithsin's utility as topical HIV microbicide. HIV microbicides are an extremely cost-sensitive market and plant-based griffithsin protein expression has the potential to meet those demands. The griffithsin product used in the clinic has been expressed and purified in N. benthamiana, using a TMV-based viral vector system, Geneware®. Outdoor pharming of biopharmaceuticals would further alleviate startup costs for biotechnology firms and may allow broader product accessibility. Therefore, this study assessed expression in a hybrid tobacco line, N. excelsiana, that is susceptible to TMV-based viral vectors and can be grown outdoors. In addition to using this hybrid line we expand on methods for in planta storage of griffithsin in leafy plants by ensiling kilogram quantities of griffithsin. The ensiling process allows year-round biomanufacturing, minimal environmental-controlled storage, and reduces the industry need for multiple growth areas to maintain multi-product manufacturing of plant-based pharmaceuticals. This study shows that griffithsin can be expressed in N. excelsiana and is stable, recoverable, and active from ensiled tissue. These studies can pave the way for future plant-based pharmaceuticals to be expressed and stored in this manner.","Eapen, Paul; Cates, Jennifer; Mundell, Rich; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Fuqua, Joshua L.",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00199,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093594/,PMC,10.3389/fbioe.2020.00199,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18
31,Nomogram for the Individualized Prediction of Survival Among Patients with H7N9 Infection,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, almost all of these studies have identified multiple risk factors but did not offer practical instruments for routine use in predicting individualized survival in human H7N9 infection cases. The objective of this study is to create a practical instrument for use in predicting an individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients. METHODS: A matched case–control study (1:2 ratios) was performed in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2019. We reviewed specific factors and outcomes regarding patients with H7N9 virus infection (VI) to determine relationships and developed a nomogram to calculate individualized survival probability. This tool was used to predict each individual patient’s probability of survival based on results obtained from the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: We examined 227 patients with H7N9 VI enrolled in our study. Stepwise selection was applied to the data, which resulted in a final model with 8 independent predictors [including initial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio ≤300 mmHg, age ≥60 years, chronic diseases, poor hand hygiene, time from illness onset to the first medical visit, incubation period ≤5 days, peak C-reactive protein ≥120 mg/L], and initial bilateral lung infection. The concordance index of this nomogram was 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.694–0.901] and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.611–0.952) for the training and validation sets, respectively, which indicates adequate discriminatory power. The calibration curves for the survival showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation in the training and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a novel nomogram that can accurately predict the survival probability of patients with H7N9 VI. This nomogram can serve an important role in counseling patients with H7N9 VI and guide treatment decisions.","Cheng, Qinglin; Sun, Zhou; Zhao, Gang; Xie, Li",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s242168,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094003/,PMC,10.2147/rmhp.s242168,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

33,Management of Adenoviral Keratoconjunctivitis: Challenges and Solutions,"Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, accounting for up to 75% of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics. In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.","Labib, Bisant A; Minhas, Bhawanjot K; Chigbu, DeGaulle I",https://www.doi.org/10.2147/opth.s207976,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094151/,PMC,10.2147/opth.s207976,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17
34,"Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Rationale for Their Utilization as Adjunctive Countermeasures in the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates. Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well. Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an epiphenomenon of edema formation rather than coagulation activation. Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema. It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS. In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide. Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity. Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE. Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted. The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed. Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed. Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.","Solaimanzadeh, Isaac",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7343,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096066/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7343,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
35,Influence of interferon-based drugs on immunological indices in specific prevention,"AIM: The research aimed to study the effect of interferon (IFN)-based drugs on the behavior of immunological parameters in calves during the specific prevention of associative infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The object of research was 45 black motley cows and their calves from birth to 2 months of life. Serum and colostrum samples were screened for antibodies against Rotavirus, diarrhea, and coronavirus using serological methods. The testing was performed before vaccination, 40 days before calving, 20 days before calving, and before calving. Colostrum samples were taken during the first milk yield. Serum samples from calves were drawn before colostrum feeding as well as at 7, 14, and 21 days, and 1 and 2 months of age. To measure the level of immunoglobulins A, M, and G, additional serum samples were collected from calves at 25, 35, 65, and 75 days after birth. RESULTS: Giving pregnant cows, an IFN-based drug at a dose of 1 ml/kg 48 h before vaccination results in the development and accumulation of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, and viral diarrhea (VD) in the colostrum, with a titer of 7.6±0.3 log(2), 5.8±0.34 log(2), and 4.4±0.18 log(2), respectively. It indicates an increase in the antigenic activity of the multivalent vaccine. CONCLUSION: IFN-based drugs enhance the protective effect of vaccination against associative infections in the newborn calves. They stimulate a rise in the titer of antibodies to Rotavirus, coronavirus, VD, and mucosal disease complex as well as an increase in immunoglobulins A, M, and G.","Andreeva, Alfia; Nikolaeva, Oksana; Altynbekov, Oleg; Galieva, Chulpan; Ilina, Kseniia",https://www.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.238-244,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096290/,PMC,10.14202/vetworld.2020.238-244,10/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-10
36,Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of canine parvovirus circulating in Egypt,"AIM: This study aimed to detect and characterize current genotypes of canine parvovirus (CPV) in Egypt during 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277. Phylogenetic analysis of the Egyptian strains serotype 2b illustrated that they were closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers KP715709, KP715694, KP715701, and KP715700); while Egyptian strains serotype 2c was closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers MH711894 and MH711902), Taiwanese strain (KU244254), Chinese strain (MF467242), and Vietnamese strain (accession number LC216910). CONCLUSION: The current research recommends further epidemiological studies to assess the extent of the occurrence of different serotypes of CPV in Egypt and the efficiency of imported and locally produced vaccines in protection against CPV infection.","Zaher, Kawther Sayed; El-Dabae, Wahid Hussein; El-Sebelgy, Mostafa Mohamed; Aly, Naglaa Ibrahim; Salama, Zeinab Taha",https://www.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2020.326-333,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096306/,PMC,10.14202/vetworld.2020.326-333,19/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-19

40,Targeting the Endocytic Pathway and Autophagy Process as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy in COVID-19,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded positive genomic RNA viruses and some of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs. In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes.

Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism. However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women. In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject. We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease. Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.","Yi, Ye; Lagniton, Philip N.P.; Ye, Sen; Li, Enqin; Xu, Ren-He",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45134,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098028/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45134,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
42,Perspectives on therapeutic neutralizing antibodies against the Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world. Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV. Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs. Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.","Zhou, Guangyu; Zhao, Qi",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45123,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098029/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45123,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
43,SARS-CoV-2: an Emerging Coronavirus that Causes a Global Threat,"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, currently designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported recently. However, as SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, we know little about it. In this review, we summarize the key events occurred during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the basic characteristics of the pathogen, the signs and symptoms of the infected patients as well as the possible transmission pathways of the virus. Furthermore, we also review the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2. We highlight bats as the potential natural reservoir and pangolins as the possible intermediate host of the virus, but their roles are waiting for further investigation. Finally, the advances in the development of chemotherapeutic options are also briefly summarized.","Zheng, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45053,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098030/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45053,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
44,Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45472,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098031/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45472,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
45,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in clinical specimens and clinical characteristics of 10 patients with COVID-19 in Macau,"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","Lo, Iek Long; Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Cheong, Tak Hong; Zhong, Xu; Tian, Yakun; Sin, Nin Ngan",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45357,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098032/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45357,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15

47,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.","Zhong, Bao-Liang; Luo, Wei; Li, Hai-Mei; Zhang, Qian-Qian; Liu, Xiao-Ge; Li, Wen-Tian; Li, Yi",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45221,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098034/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45221,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
48,The COVID-19 outbreak and psychiatric hospitals in China: managing challenges through mental health service reform,"Recently, more than 300 Chinese patients with psychiatric disorders were diagnosed with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

We outlined major challenges for patients with psychiatric disorders and mental health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak, and also discussed how to manage these challenges through further mental health service reform in China.","Xiang, Yu-Tao; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Liu, Zi-Han; Li, Xiao-Hong; Zhao, Na; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H.",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45072,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098035/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45072,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
49,Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Patients Infected with 2019-New Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A Review and Perspective,"Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease. The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment. In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed. Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.","Yang, Yang; Islam, Md Sahidul; Wang, Jin; Li, Yuan; Chen, Xin",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45538,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098036/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45538,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
50,Progression of Mental Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak in China,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly transmitted in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and other Asian and European counterparts. This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control. The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services. In addition, mental health professionals and expert groups are stationed in designated isolation hospitals to provide on-site services. Experts have reached a consensus on the admission of patients with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 outbreak in mental health institutions. Nevertheless, the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 has emerged to mount a serious challenge to the mental health service in China.","Li, Wen; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qinge; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao",https://www.doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45120,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098037/,PMC,10.7150/ijbs.45120,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15
51,Infants Born to Mothers With a New Coronavirus (COVID-19),"A novel viral respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in cases in China and worldwide. Four full-term, singleton infants were born to pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19 in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, where the disease was first identified. Of the three infants, for who consent to be diagnostically tested was provided, none tested positive for the virus. None of the infants developed serious clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, or abnormal radiologic or hematologic evidence, and all four infants were alive at the time of hospital discharge. Two infants had rashes of unknown etiology at birth, and one had facial ulcerations. One infant had tachypnea and was supported by non-invasive mechanical ventilation for 3 days. One had rashes at birth but was discharged without parental consent for a diagnostic test. This case report describes the clinical course of four live born infants, born to pregnant women with the COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Yan; Peng, Hua; Wang, Lin; Zhao, Yin; Zeng, Lingkong; Gao, Hui; Liu, Yalan",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00104,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098456/,PMC,10.3389/fped.2020.00104,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16
52,C-X-C Motif Chemokine 10 Contributes to the Development of Neuropathic Pain by Increasing the Permeability of the Blood–Spinal Cord Barrier,"Neuropathic pain is among the most debilitating forms of chronic pain. Studies have suggested that chronic pain pathogenesis involves neuroimmune interactions and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We modeled neuropathic pain in rats by inducing chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and analyzed the effects on C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/CXCR3 activation, BSCB permeability, and immune cell migration from the circulation into the spinal cord. We detected CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons and observed that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 activation, BSCB disruption, and mechanical hyperalgesia. CCI-induced BSCB disruption enabled circulating T cells to migrate into the spinal parenchyma. Intrathecal administration of an anti-CXCL10 antibody not only attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia, but also reduced BSCB permeability, suggesting that CXCL10 acts as a key regulator of BSCB integrity. Moreover, T cell migration may play a critical role in the neuroimmune interactions involved in the pathogenesis of CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Our results highlight CXCL10 as a new potential drug target for the treatment of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.","Li, Hao-Ling; Huang, Yan; Zhou, Ya-Lan; Teng, Run-Hua; Zhou, Shu-Zhuan; Lin, Jia-Piao; Yang, Yan; Zhu, Sheng-Mei; Xu, Hua; Yao, Yong-Xing",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00477,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098954/,PMC,10.3389/fimmu.2020.00477,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
53,A Precision Medicine Approach to Rhinitis Evaluation and Management,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The PM approach focuses on the characterization of different phenotypes and pathogenic pathways in order to allow the selection of specific biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Rhinitis is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disease, both in terms of underlying endotypes and clinical presentations. Therefore, to apply the PM principles to the various rhinitis subtypes rise as a meaningful strategy to improve evaluation and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The technology of recombinant allergens has allowed molecular characterization of IgE reactivity of specific individual components of allergenic extracts. Recently published and ongoing clinical trials based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD) bring more precision to allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines involved in inflammatory allergic and nonallergic rhinitis endotypes show promissory results. SUMMARY: Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with rhinitis symptoms contributes to point out clinical usefulness of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which leads to more accurate environmental control measures, personalized pharmacologic options, and new biological therapy developments.","Crisci, Carlos D.; Ardusso, Ledit R.

63,Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China,"Universal health coverage (UHC) is driving the global health agenda. Many countries have embarked on national policy reforms towards this goal, including China. In 2009, the Chinese government launched a new round of healthcare reform towards UHC, aiming to provide universal coverage of basic healthcare by the end of 2020. The year of 2019 marks the 10th anniversary of China’s most recent healthcare reform. Sharing China’s experience is especially timely for other countries pursuing reforms to achieve UHC. This study describes the social, economic and health context in China, and then reviews the overall progress of healthcare reform (1949 to present), with a focus on the most recent (2009) round of healthcare reform. The study comprehensively analyses key reform initiatives and major achievements according to four aspects: health insurance system, drug supply and security system, medical service system and public health service system.

68,KCDC Risk Assessments on the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the risk assessments of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), from the point of detection to the provision of basic information to the relevant public health authorities. METHODS: To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using available information. To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC used 5 levels (“very low,” “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high”) for each category and overall risk was eventually decided. RESULTS: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8(th) to February 28(th), 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries. The overall risk of the situation in each assessment increased in severity over this period: “low” (first), “moderate” (second), “high” (third), “high” (fourth), “high” (fifth), “high” (sixth), “high” (seventh), and “very high” (eighth). CONCLUSION: The KCDC’s 8 risk assessments were utilized to activate national emergency response mechanisms and eventually prepare for the pandemic to ensure the containment and mitigation of COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.","Kim, Inho; Lee, Jia; Lee, Jihee; Shin, Eensuk; Chu, Chaeshin; Lee, Seon Kui",https://www.doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.02,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104687/,PMC,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.02,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10

70,Cross-Country Comparison of Case Fatality Rates of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2,"OBJECTIVES: Case fatality rates (CFR) and recovery rates are important readouts during epidemics and pandemics. In this article, an international analysis was performed on the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Data were retrieved from accurate databases according to the user’s guide of data sources for patient registries, CFR and recovery rates were calculated for each country. A comparison of CFR between countries with total cases ≥ 1,000 was observed for 12(th) and 23(rd) March. RESULTS: Italy’s CFR was the highest of all countries studied for both time points (12(th) March, 6.22% versus 23(rd) March, 9.26%). The data showed that even though Italy was the only European country reported on 12(rd) March, Spain and France had the highest CFR of 6.16 and 4.21%, respectively, on 23(rd) March, which was strikingly higher than the overall CFR of 3.61%. CONCLUSION: Obtaining detailed and accurate medical history from COVID-19 patients, and analyzing CFR alongside the recovery rate, may enable the identification of the highest risk areas so that efficient medical care may be provided. This may lead to the development of point-of-care tools to help clinicians in stratifying patients based on possible requirements in the level of care, to increase the probabilities of survival from COVID-19 disease.","Khafaie, Morteza Abdullatif; Rahim, Fakher",https://www.doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104689/,PMC,10.24171/j.phrp.2020.11.2.03,10/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-10
71,"The experience of high-flow nasal cannula in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in two hospitals of Chongqing, China","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China. Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy. However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1–2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25–29) vs. 23 (22–25), p = 0.03]. However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO(2)/FiO(2) significantly improved after 1–2 h of NIV [median 172 (150–208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79–130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) were more likely to experience HFNC failure.","Wang, Ke; Zhao, Wei; Li, Ji; Shu, Weiwei; Duan, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104710/,PMC,10.1186/s13613-020-00653-z,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
72,Microbial burden and viral exacerbations in a longitudinal multicenter COPD cohort,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent exacerbation phenotypes independent of disease stage. Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota plays a role in disease progression and severity, but long-term and international multicenter assessment of the variations in viral and bacterial communities as drivers of exacerbations are lacking. METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P < 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P < 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event. Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR > 0.17; P < 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency (OR > 0.39; P < 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights bacterial taxa in lung sensitization and viral triggers in COPD exacerbations. It provides a global overview of the diverse targets for drug development and explores new microbiome analysis methods to guide future patient management applications.","Bouquet, Jerome; Tabor, David E.; Silver, Jonathan S.; Nair, Varsha; Tovchigrechko, Andrey; Griffin, M.

73,Clinical trials on drug repositioning for COVID-19 treatment,"The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China). Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants’ clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","Rosa, Sandro G.

74,COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?,"Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is paramount. There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review aimed to collate information available in published articles to identify any evidence behind these claims with the aim of advising clinicians on how best to treat patients. This review found no published evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if utilised in the early acute phase of infection, however, conflicting evidence from the World Health Organisation surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. Given the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105332/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
75,Associations between immune-suppressive and stimulating drugs and novel COVID-19—a systematic review of current evidence,"BACKGROUND: Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs. This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. RESULTS: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; George, Gincy; Santaolalla, Aida; Cope, Andrew; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105343/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.1022,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
76,A GMC Oxidoreductase GmcA Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae,"GmcA is a FAD-containing enzyme belonging to the GMC (glucose-methanol-choline oxidase) family of oxidoreductases. A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H(2)O(2) conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity. Moreover, nine proteins related to amino acid metabolism were over-expressed.","Zou, Qian; Luo, Sha; Wu, Hetao; He, Donglan; Li, Xiaohua; Cheng, Guojun",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00394,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105596/,PMC,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00394,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
77,Recombinant Lactococcus Lactis Expressing M1-HA2 Fusion Protein Provides Protective Mucosal Immunity Against H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus in Chickens,"H9N2 subtype low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is distributed worldwide and causes enormous economic losses in the poultry industry. Despite immunization of almost all chickens with inactivated vaccines, the disease still remains widespread. We speculated that improving mucosal or cellular immune responses could contribute to improved control of H9N2 viruses. In this study, we constructed a novel Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) strain expressing a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the M1 and HA2 proteins derived from an antigenically conserved endemic H9N2 virus strain. The M1-HA2 fusion protein was cloned downstream of a gene encoding a secretory peptide, and we subsequently confirmed that the fusion protein was secreted from L. lactis by Western blotting. We assessed the immunogenicity and protective effects of this recombinant L. lactis strain. Eighty 1-day-old chickens were divided into four groups, and the experimental groups were orally vaccinated twice with the recombinant L. lactis strain. Fecal and intestinal samples, sera, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination (dpv). Chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed significantly increased levels of serum antibodies, T cell-mediated immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA). Following challenge with H9N2 virus at 21 dpv, chickens vaccinated with the recombinant L. lactis strain showed decreased weight loss, lower viral titers in the lung, and reduced lung pathological damage. In summary, our results demonstrated that a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an H9N2 M1-HA2 fusion protein could induce protective mucosal and systemic immunity. This oral vaccine is H9N2 virus-specific and represents a significant design improvement compared with previous studies. Our study provides a theoretical basis for improving mucosal immune responses to prevent and control H9N2 virus infection.","Sha, Zhou; Shang, Hongqi; Miao, Yongqiang; Huang, Jin; Niu, Xiangyun; Chen, Ruichang; Hu, Liping; Huang, He; Wei, Kai; Zhu, Ruiliang",https://www.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00153,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105734/,PMC,10.3389/fvets.2020.00153,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
78,Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus Induces Cell-cycle Arrest through the DNA Damage-signalling Pathway,"INTRODUCTION: Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) infection causes watery diarrhoea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss, especially among neonatal piglets, inflicting on them morbidity and mortality potentially reaching 90%–100%. Despite it being known that certain mammalian cell phases are arrested by PEDV, the mechanisms have not been elucidated, and PEDV pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study determined the effect of an epidemic PEDV strain on cell cycle progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We observed the effect of the PEDV SHpd/2012 strain on an infected Vero cell cycle through flow cytometry and Western blot, investigating the interrelationships of cell-cycle arrest, the DNA damage–signalling pathway caused by PEDV and the phosphorylation levels of the key molecules Chk.2 and H2A.X involved upstream and downstream in this pathway. RESULTS: PEDV induced Vero cell-cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase. The phosphorylation levels of Chk.2 and H2A.X increased with the prolongation of PEDV infection, and no significant cell-cycle arrest was observed after treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. The proliferation of PEDV was also inhibited by treatment with ATM or Chk.2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: PEDV-induced cell-cycle arrest is associated with activation of DNA damage–signalling pathways. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis of PEDV replication and provide evidence to support further evaluation of PEDV pathogenesis.","Luo, Yi-Ran; Zhou, Shu-Ting; Yang, Liang; Liu, Yuan-Ping; Jiang, Sheng-Yao; Dawuli, Yeliboli; Hou, Yi-Xuan; Zhou, Tian-Xing; Yang, Zhi-Biao",https://www.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2020-0024,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105999/,PMC,10.2478/jvetres-2020-0024,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides. The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential.

From the basic science to the latest developments and innovations, starting with the history of the material, this chapter presents a facile way to understand the antibacterial activity of the chitosan, together with other materials, to the reader. This chapter also summarizes the general developments in the study of antimicrobial applications. In the light of the current situation of the research and the progress in the related fields, this chapter discusses the differences among influencing factors in detail and compares the antimicrobial activity between different physical states of chitosan. Also, this chaper discusses the more recent processes and applications.","Yilmaz Atay, Hüsnügül",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0263-7_15,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114974/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0263-7_15,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06
94,Drug repurposing strategies for COVID-19,"COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic and new treatments are urgently needed as we enter a phase beyond containment. Developing new drugs from scratch is a lengthy process, thus impractical to face the immediate global challenge. Drug repurposing is an emerging strategy where existing medicines, having already been tested safe in humans, are redeployed to combat difficult-to-treat diseases. While using such repurposed drugs individually may ultimately not yield a significant clinical benefit, carefully combined cocktails could be very effective, as was for HIV in the 1990s; the urgent question now being which combination.","Senanayake, Suranga L",https://www.doi.org/10.4155/fdd-2020-0010,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117595/,PMC,10.4155/fdd-2020-0010,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25
95,COVID-19: Emergency Medicine Physician Empowered to Shape Perspectives on This Public Health Crisis,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has sparked a remarkable public response in the United States. The following publication highlights the integral role that Emergency Medicine (EM) providers are afforded as a result of the public health circumstances. By embracing the unique outlet of direct patient coordination of care, EM providers can correct public misconceptions and promote more appropriate social distancing practices to the greater community.","Gaeta, Christopher; Brennessel, Ryan",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7504,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117614/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7504,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

97,Vasculitis,"Vasculitis, characterized by inflammation and necrosis, manifests a wide spectrum of presentation by involving a vasculature of various sizes and locations. A definitive diagnosis of vasculitis invariably requires histologic confirmation since there are no diagnostic clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings. The most widely adopted vasculitis classification is the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature of systemic vasculitis which integrated clinical symptoms, histopathologic features, and laboratory findings. This classification accounts for the size of the involved vessels. This chapter outlines the clinical and histologic features of the small-vessel vasculitis including the immune complex vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; medium-vessel vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease; large-vessel vasculitis, namely, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis; variable-vessel vasculitis such as Behcet disease and Cogan syndrome; and vasculitis associated with systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus vasculitis, and sarcoid vasculitis. Vasculitis can also be secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma. Therefore, a diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be based on histologic ground alone. Clinical pathologic correlation is necessary.","Hoang, Mai P.; Park, Joonsoo",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35820-4_7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120156/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35820-4_7,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
98,Pneumonia Caused by Emerging Viral Agents,"Emerging viruses that cause pneumonia in humans are agents which normally circulate in the animal population but can move to human hosts under certain circumstances, which determines the occurrence of a new type of disease. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a coronavirus. The disease has a wide symptomatic spectrum that can range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant respiratory failure. Diagnostic confirmation is achieved through viral isolation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also produced by a coronavirus, is capable of producing a serious pulmonary disease outbreak with no reappearance. The clinical presentation includes fever, malaise, cough, and headache followed by diarrhea. Other coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) can cause serious lower respiratory infections in small children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed patients. Influenza virus is widespread in nature, and avian virus may spread to humans, as has been reported with H7N9, H5N1, H10N8, and H6N1. Cardiopulmonary hantavirus syndrome, a feverish disease characterized by respiratory insufficiency and shock, is produced by Andes virus. Other emerging viruses are enterovirus D68 and polyomavirus.","Perret Pérez, Cecilia; Ferrés Garrido, Marcela",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_34,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120232/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_34,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
99,Blood Transfusion-Associated Infections in the Twenty-First Century: New Challenges,"Blood transfusions are vital components of modern medical treatment to which there is no viable alternative despite efforts to create artificial blood. Each year thousands of lives are saved by blood transfusions in every country of the world. However, blood and blood products can result in significant adverse events including immunologic reactions, infections, inefficacy, and others which can sometimes result in death and severe disability. Thus, the sustainability of safe blood systems and costs are considered to be at crisis level. In industrialized countries, the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections such as HIV, syphilis, hepatitis viruses B and C are very low [generally [<1 in a million units], but in developing countries [especially in Africa] blood safety is still not assured. Compounding the problem of blood/product safety with respect to infectious agents are new emerging infectious microbes that are not being routinely tested for in blood that are donated. This chapter reviews the infectious risk of blood transfusions, types, mode and geographic variation, and the methods being used by blood services to attenuate and prevent these risks.","Fong, I.

This chapter reviews triage practices, including early isolation and decontamination, of highly infectious diseases and bioterrorism agents at different health system levels.","Bezek, Sarah; Jaung, Michael; Mackey, Joy",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120388/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_3,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
101,Malaria,"Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and environmental changes are likely to increase its importance in the coming years. Diagnosing this disease is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in non-endemic countries. Critical care providers play a major role in treating severe malaria and its complications, which has management particularities that might not be readily apparent. Fluid resuscitation should be carefully tailored to avoid complications, and dysperfusion seems more related to degree of parasitemia than hypovolemia. Antimalarial agents are effective, but resistance is growing. Complications can be found in nearly every organ, including cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury. As such, a critical care unit is frequently required for organ support when they appear. Superimposed infections are not infrequent. Despite all of this, mortality is encouragingly low with a timely diagnosis and access to appropriate treatment.","Hidalgo, Jorge; Arriaga, Pedro; Concejo, Bruno Alvarez",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120402/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_13,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
102,Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Community-acquired pneumonia is an infection of the small airways and pulmonary parenchyma that develops in the outpatient setting. Despite the development of new antibiotics and vaccines, pneumonia is still a disease that occurs frequently in children under 5 years of age and is one of the main causes of mortality, especially in developing countries. The biggest challenge in treating pneumonia is to determine the agent, which depends on age, disease severity, immunological condition, geographic location, epidemiological situation, and immunizations. The classic clinical picture presents with fever, coughing, and difficulty in breathing. The physical examination shows tachypnea, reduced breath sounds, and fine crackles. Wheezing may be present in infants with viral pneumonia. The chest X-ray is considered an important tool to confirm the disease diagnosis and may guide specific treatment. Acute-phase reactants have a low sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between virus and bacteria. Microbiological identification does not have a clinical impact for most children with community-acquired pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be considered for immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic treatment is empirical based on the best possible etiology, depending on the patient’s age and epidemiological timing. Amoxicillin is the treatment of choice for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and azithromycin is preferred for Mycoplasma pneumoniae.","Boza Costagliola, María Lina",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120449/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_31,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01

A surveillance program implemented a decade ago has allow pediatricians to improve the diagnostic yield on a regular basis.","Avendaño Carvajal, Luis; Perret Pérez, Cecilia",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120591/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_28,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
106,"Influenza, Measles, SARS, MERS, and Smallpox","Influenza, measles, SARS, MERS, and smallpox illnesses are caused by highly infectious viral pathogens that induce critical illness. These biologically diverse viruses enter and replicate within host cells triggering viral- and host-mediated damage that results in pneumonia and multiorgan failure in severe cases. Early case identification and strict infection control limit healthcare transmission. Vaccination allowed smallpox eradication and limits global measles and seasonal influenza mortality. While SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is no longer circulating, MERS-CoV and zoonotic influenza viruses, with pandemic potential, remain persistent threats. Supportive critical care is the mainstay of treatment for severe disease due to these viral infections.","Chertow, Daniel S.; Kindrachuk, Jason",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120728/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_5,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
107,Sickle Cell Disease,"Sickle cell disease is characterized by vaso-occlusive and hemolysis events that may occur in a variable range of clinical presentations. Patients with this disease, particularly with acute chest syndrome, suffer acute episodes of chest pain caused by vaso-occlusive crisis, that tend to repeat, especially under the influence of lower respiratory infections, dehydration, and any cause of hypoxemia. Children and adolescents with sickle cell disease must be periodically evaluated through oximetry, lung function tests, sleep study, and echocardiograms to detect obstructive and restrictive diseases that frequently worsens the lung condition. Asthma and sleep disorders contribute to morbidity and must be controlled.","Álvarez, Ofelia; Wietstruck, María Angélica",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_52,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120761/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-26961-6_52,01/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-01
108,The Impact and Control of Emerging and Re-Emerging Viral Diseases in the Environment: An African Perspective,"Emerging viral infections (EVI), and re-emergent variants of existing ones, are a growing threat to public health worldwide with outbreaks occurring sporadically especially in Africa associated with significant adverse ecological, socioeconomic and public health implications. These pathogens have devised evolved environmental adaptations, including the possession of genomic resistance mutations. Haemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses and respiratory pathogens like the avian and human influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, most from zoonotic reservoirs, may significantly increase morbidity and mortality in the human population in the nearest future. Likewise, vector-borne zoonotic viral diseases including Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile, transmitted by arthropods from animal reservoirs, occur frequently in the tropics, exhibiting previously unseen patterns of infection and spread. These patterns are facilitated by many intrinsic factors like mutated sites in the viral genome, and external factors including urbanization, displacement, human migration and climate change. Emerging viruses can easily cross boundaries and pose severe threats to the human populations in new geographical areas. Here, we outline the features of common emergent viruses and factors facilitating their emergence, effects, control and sustained management in the environment.","Shenge, Juliet Adamma; Opayele, Adewale Victor",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35296-7_7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120784/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35296-7_7,05/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-05
109,Issues in Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is one of the most commonly diagnosed infectious diseases and is the third most frequent cause of death worldwide. Accurate statistics of community-acquired pneumonia incidence globally or in countries of various regions are lacking. Although the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is not difficult, the etiology diagnosis to guide targeted specific antimicrobial therapy still poses a challenge even with novel molecular methods. This has led to different approaches and guidelines for the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, often with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents which may play a role in fostering the worldwide development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Severe community-acquired pneumonia, seen mainly at the extremes of age and in persons with chronic underlying diseases, is associated with high mortality of 20–40%. Pneumonia severity tools, such as CURB-65, have been developed over the past decade to assist emergency department physicians to recognize, admit, and implement rapid antimicrobial therapy in severely ill patients. The evidence for the beneficial effects of these tools will be reviewed in this chapter. Issues in the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia that are discussed include: combination with newer macrolides [irrespective of microbial etiology], value of adjunctive therapy such as corticosteroids and statins.","Fong, I.

110,Concerns and Threats of Contamination on Aquatic Ecosystems,"Aquatic ecosystems are the ultimate sinks for the contaminants. Water contamination is the outcome of human activities such as urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural activities. The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers and sewage from residential and industrial areas ultimately find its way to aquatic environment. Thus results in the degradation of the water quality and leads to the spread of infectious diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and jaundice. Contamination in aquatic environs is one of the leading types of pollution which has significant negative health issues and mortality. Water has a natural capacity to neutralize the contamination, but when contamination becomes uncontrolled, water will lose its self-generating capacity. Therefore, there is a need for regular monitoring and controlling of pollutant discharge into the nearby aquatic environs.","Bashir, Ishrat; Lone, F. A.; Bhat, Rouf Ahmad; Mir, Shafat A.; Dar, Zubair A.; Dar, Shakeel Ahmad",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35691-0_1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121614/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35691-0_1,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27
111,Flourishing,"Being part of, or witnessing, a terrible disaster is clearly very distressing. How do we minimize this kind of distress and continue to flourish in the future as we face extreme climate events such as wildfires and flooding? How do we identify and learn from past events lying hidden, unrecognized and unforeseen as failure incubated? What are the global ‘grand challenges’—both natural and man-made? What are the UN Sustainable Development Goals? To achieve them do we need to reverse the fragmentation of the professions into ‘silos’? What is ‘joined-up’ thinking in ‘joined-up’ organisations and nation states and how important is it? Despite all the advances in science, we know less actually than we think we know. Contingency planning that expects surprises must be the new norm. Learn anew how to learn together is the new wisdom. Use the golden rule ‘do not do to others that you would not have them do to you’, whatever you are told to believe, is our tenet. Behaviour is more important than belief—imperfect doing is better than uncertain knowing. But to do all of this collectively requires leadership that we can trust—perhaps the biggest challenge of all?","Blockley, David",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38257-5_9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121705/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-38257-5_9,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01

114,Acute and Chronic Infection Management in CF,"CFTR protein malfunction results in thick, copious mucus, causes poor mucociliary clearance and, ultimately, structural lung damage such as bronchiectasis. All of these manifestations of cystic fibrosis contribute to a rich milieu for lower respiratory pathogens in patients affected by the disease. CF patients are, therefore, highly susceptible to chronic colonization with many pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They are also uniquely prone to acute infections with respiratory pathogens, which tend to persist longer and cause more impairment in lung function than in patients without CF. Tailored strategies for managing infectious complications of CF patients include chronic prophylactic antibiotics, use of systemic as well as inhaled antibiotics, mechanical assistance with mucus clearance, and scrupulous infection control measures.","Allen, Patrick; Borick, Joseph; Borick, Jamie",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-25909-9_8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121858/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-25909-9_8,29/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-29
115,"Zoonotic Infections and Biowarfare Agents in Critical Care: Anthrax, Plague, and Tularemia","Bacterial zoonotic infections are rare in developed countries in the twenty-first century but may cause major morbidity and mortality in developing regions of the world. In addition, their potential use as biological weapons makes early recognition and effective empiric therapy important for the critical care practitioner. Anthrax, plague, and tularemia share overlapping presenting syndromes, including fulminant respiratory infections and less severe but still highly morbid lymphocutaneous infections. Although all three may be transmitted as infectious aerosols, only plague has a risk of direct human-to-human transmission. Diagnostic testing will require special precautions for laboratory staff and most often involvement of regional and national reference laboratories. Empiric therapy with aminoglycosides may be life-saving for plague and tularemia, while the treatment of anthrax is complex and varies depending on the site of infection. In outbreaks or for post-exposure prophylaxis, treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone is recommended for all three diseases.","Maves, Ryan C.; Berjohn, Catherine M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122055/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33803-9_6,03/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-03
116,Arguing from Ignorance,"It might seem that it can never be rational to argue from a state of ignorance. But this is not the case. Ignorance arguments abound in our everyday thinking such as when we conclude that a train does not stop in York because York is not listed in the timetable. These arguments also tend to be the first line of defence when the safety of food or prescribed medications is called into question. The statement ‘There is no evidence that beef is unsafe’, which is a premise in an ignorance argument, was used so extensively by health officials and government ministers during the BSE epidemic in the UK that it came to be called the mantra of the BSE affair by the public inquiry into the epidemic. A similar ignorance premise is often used to frame the conclusion of systematic reviews into the effectiveness of a particular medical or health intervention. This chapter examines the various purposes for which ignorance arguments are advanced in medicine and health and considers the epistemic conditions under which these arguments are more or less rationally warranted.","Cummings, Louise",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-28513-5_2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122285/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-28513-5_2,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01
117,Nanomaterial Effects on Viral Infection,"The potential for environmental and occupational exposures of populations to nanomaterials (NMs) has fostered concerns of associated adverse health effects, with a particular emphasis on pulmonary injury and disease. Many studies have revealed that several types of NMs can evoke a variety of biological responses, such as pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to allergy, fibrosis, and granuloma formation. Less attention has been paid to health effects that may result from exposure to NMs and additional stressors such as pathogens, with a particular focus on susceptibility to viral infection. This chapter will summarize the current body of literature related to NMs and viral exposures with a primary focus on immune modulation. A summary of the studies performed and major findings to date will be discussed, highlighting proposed molecular mechanisms behind NM-driven host susceptibility, challenges, limitations, and future research needs. Specific mechanisms discussed include direct interaction between NMs and biological molecules, activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and related signaling pathways, production of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and modulation of lipid signaling networks.","Chen, Hao; Humes, Sara T.; Saleh, Navid B.; Lednicky, John A.; Sabo-Attwood, Tara",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33962-3_10,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122331/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-33962-3_10,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31
118,Genetic Basis of Myocarditis: Myth or Reality?,"The genetic basis of myocarditis remains an intriguing concept, at least as long as the definition of myocarditis constitutes the definitive presence of myocardial inflammation sufficient to cause the observed ventricular dysfunction in the setting of cardiotropic infections. Autoimmune or immune-mediated myocardial inflammation constitutes a complex area of clinical interest, wherein numerous and not yet fully understood role of hereditary auto-inflammatory diseases can result in inflammation of the pericardium and myocardium. Finally, myocardial involvement in hereditary immunodeficiency diseases, cellular and humoral, is a possible trigger for infections which may complicate the diseases themselves. Whether the role of constitutional genetics can make the patient susceptible to myocardial inflammation remains yet to be explored.","Arbustini, Eloisa; Narula, Nupoor; Giuliani, Lorenzo; Di Toro, Alessandro",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35276-9_4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122345/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-35276-9_4,07/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-07

120,Porcine Coronaviruses,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) are enteropathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) of swine. TGEV appearance in 1946 preceded identification of PEDV (1971) and PDCoV (2009) that are considered as emerging CoVs. A spike deletion mutant of TGEV associated with respiratory tract infection in piglets appeared in 1984 in pigs in Belgium and was designated porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is considered non-pathogenic because the infection is very mild or subclinical. Since PRCV emergence and rapid spread, most pigs have become immune to both PRCV and TGEV, which has significantly reduced the clinical and economic importance of TGEV. In contrast, PDCoV and PEDV are currently expanding their geographic distribution, and there are reports on the circulation of TGEV-PEDV recombinants that cause a disease clinically indistinguishable from that associated with the parent viruses. TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV cause acute gastroenteritis in pigs (most severe in neonatal piglets) and matches in their clinical signs and pathogenesis. Necrosis of the infected intestinal epithelial cells causes villous atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhoea. Profuse diarrhoea frequently combined with vomiting results in dehydration, which can lead to the death of piglets. Strong immune responses following natural infection protect against subsequent homologous challenge; however, these viruses display no cross-protection. Adoption of advance biosecurity measures and effective vaccines control and prevent the occurrence of diseases due to these porcine-associated CoVs. Recombination and reversion to virulence are the risks associated with generally highly effective attenuated vaccines necessitating further research on alternative vaccines to ensure their safe application in the field.","Vlasova, A.

121,Sapelovirus,"Sapelovirus (SPV), an emerging virus in the family Picornaviridae, is detected in several animal and bird species irrespective of their age. Amid all SPVs, porcine sapeloviruses (PSVs) are more ubiquitously present all over the world in porcine population. These viruses are highly stable in different environmental conditions and spread easily within the susceptible animals mainly through faeco-oral route. Usually, PSVs cause asymptomatic infections but are also clinically associated with encephalomyelitis, respiratory distress, fertility disorders and skin lesions. PSV-associated outbreaks have been reported where death occurs due to polioencephalitis and respiratory paralysis. Till date, PSVs have been detected from several European and Asian countries with moderate-to-high prevalence and clinical course. Viral capsid proteins are immunogenic and mutations in these proteins are responsible for the diverse nature of the viruses. Further, genomic analysis shows the varied evolutionary patterns and the presence of recombination within PSV strains. These viruses also exist as concurrent infections with several enteric bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Classical to modern biotechnological assays are in use to detect PSV involving virus isolation in cell culture, immunohistochemistry, conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques, quantitative real-time amplification assays and isothermal amplification molecular techniques. Till date, there is no vaccine available against PSVs.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_14,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123037/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_14,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23

123,Teschovirus,"Teschoviruses are emerging pathogens, belonging to the family Picornaviridae, and infects porcine population only. Among all, porcine teschoviruses (PTVs) are of high prominence leading to clinical illness and consequent economic loss to the livestock sector. These are associated with extremely lethal non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis (Teschen disease) and are distributed world over. Its milder form, Talfan disease, inflicts low morbidity and mortality and general clinical disease. The first epizootics of Teschen disease occurred in 1929 in the Czech Republic. Mature virions are small (23–30 nm) and stable in environmental conditions (pH range 2–9, heat, lipid solvents). Genetic variations in the major surface protein, VP1, lead to the evolution of several new types. As of now, 13 genotypes in PTV are approved, namely PTV-1–13. Among all, PTV-1 is highly virulent and causes severe mortality and morbidity in the porcine population, domestic as well as wild. Ingestion is the main spreading route of infection, though intra-nasal infection and virus secretion in the urine are also noted. Along with encephalitis, PTVs are also responsible for reproductive disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pericarditis and myocarditis. PTVs are also found as co-infection with several bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. Several conventional and modern diagnostics tools are available for their detection. Alternative of serological typing, VP1 and VP2 gene-based molecular typing is now preferred to know the epidemiological pattern. Although initially vaccines were used for its eradication in Europe, due to the sporadic reports of mild PTV infection in several countries, the approach was discontinued. Moreover, due to the presence of multiple serotypes, developing a multivalent PTV vaccine to protect against all strains is a major challenge.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Bhat, Sudipta; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Wang, Fun-In; Touil, Nadia; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep; Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123469/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_6,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23

Examples of big data include weather data, web-search data, disease reports, as well as epidemic data and statistics. These big data can be easily generated and collected from a wide variety of data sources. A data science framework—such as predictive analytics framework—helps mining data from various big data sources to find useful information and discover knowledge, which can then be transformed into wisdom for appropriate actions. In this paper, we present an innovative big data predictive analytics framework over hybrid big data sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our framework, we conduct several case studies, including one on applying the framework to disease analytics. More specifically, we integrate, incorporate and analyze weather data and web-search data to predict and forecast dengue cases based on a hybrid of three kernels in support vector machine (SVM) ensemble. Results show how our predictive analytics framework benefits health agencies in disease control and prevention.","Souza, Joglas; Leung, Carson K.; Cuzzocrea, Alfredo",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44041-1_59,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123615/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-44041-1_59,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
126,Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viral Diseases: Perspectives and Preparedness,"The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife–human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and ‘spill-over’ and ‘spill-back’; and technology and industry for domestic animal–human EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management. This chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important TADs and EIDs along with the successes, constraints, limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches.","Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar; Malik, Yashpal Singh",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123659/,PMC,10.1007/978-981-15-0402-0_1,23/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-23
127,"Phyllospheric Microbiomes: Diversity, Ecological Significance, and Biotechnological Applications","The phyllosphere referred to the total aerial plant surfaces (above-ground portions), as habitat for microorganisms. Microorganisms establish compositionally complex communities on the leaf surface. The microbiome of phyllosphere is rich in diversity of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, and viruses. The diversity, dispersal, and community development on the leaf surface are based on the physiochemistry, environment, and also the immunity of the host plant. A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment. To the scientific advancement, several molecular techniques like metagenomics and metaproteomics have been used to study and understand the physiology and functional relationship of microbes to the host and its environment. Based on the available information, this chapter describes the basic understanding of microbiome in leaf structure and physiology, microbial interactions, especially bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, and their adaptation in the phyllosphere environment. Further, the detailed information related to the importance of the microbiome in phyllosphere to the host plant and their environment has been analyzed.

128,Investigation into SARS-CoV-2 Resistance of Compounds in Garlic Essential Oil,"[Image: see text] Eighteen active substances, including 17 organosulfur compounds found in garlic essential oil (T), were identified by GC–MS analysis. For the first time, using the molecular docking technique, we report the inhibitory effect of the considered compounds on the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in the human body that leads to a crucial foundation about coronavirus resistance of individual compounds on the main protease (PDB6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that the 17 organosulfur compounds, accounting for 99.4% contents of the garlic essential oil, have strong interactions with the amino acids of the ACE2 protein and the main protease PDB6LU7 of SARS-CoV-2. The strongest anticoronavirus activity is expressed in allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, which account for the highest content in the garlic essential oil (51.3%). Interestingly, docking results indicate the synergistic interactions of the 17 substances, which exhibit good inhibition of the ACE2 and PDB6LU7 proteins. The results suggest that the garlic essential oil is a valuable natural antivirus source, which contributes to preventing the invasion of coronavirus into the human body.","Thuy, Bui Thi Phuong; My, Tran Thi Ai; Hai, Nguyen Thi Thanh; Hieu, Le Trung; Hoa, Tran Thai; Thi Phuong Loan, Huynh; Triet, Nguyen Thanh; Anh, Tran Thi Van; Quy, Phan Tu; Tat, Pham Van; Hue, Nguyen Van; Quang, Duong Tuan; Trung, Nguyen Tien; Tung, Vo Thanh; Huynh, Lam K.; Nhung, Nguyen Thi Ai",https://www.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c00772,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123907/,PMC,10.1021/acsomega.0c00772,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

131,When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: A SEIR modeling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. METHOD: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. RESULTS: The optimal parameters were estimated as R(0) = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly. It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.","Wan, Kangkang; Chen, Jing; Lu, Changming; Dong, Lanlan; Wu, Zhicheng; Zhang, Lianglu",https://www.doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.011002,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125416/,PMC,10.7189/jogh.10.011002,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
132,An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19,"BACKGROUND: On 31 December, 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Since then, there have been over 75 000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 2000 deaths, and over 14 000 cases recovered. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. METHODS: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In February 2020, available information on COVID19 was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. RESULTS: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.","Harris, Carlyn; Carson, Gail; Baillie, J Kenneth; Horby, Peter; Nair, Harish",https://www.doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10-011001,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125419/,PMC,10.7189/jogh.10-011001,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

134,The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN e-Health Intervention to improve patient activation and self-management behaviours among individuals with Metabolic Syndrome in primary care: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies conducted in various parts of the world have clearly demonstrated that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an increasing global health problem, not only in Western societies but also in Asian populations. Web-based and mobile phone-based self-management applications have been proven to be effective in improving self-management behaviour of patients with MetS components (i.e., diabetes or hypertension). However, evidence is lacking in terms of their effectiveness specifically for patients with MetS. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention in improving activation and self-management behaviours among patients with MetS. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a university primary care clinic. A total of 232 patients aged 18–60 years with MetS will be recruited; 116 will be randomised to receive the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention for 6 months, and another 116 patients will continue with usual care. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention is a multifaceted chronic disease management strategy based on the Chronic Care Model and persuasive technology theory. It consists of training primary care physicians, nurses and patients to use the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN web-based self-management mobile app, strengthening the patient–physician relationship and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines to guide management and prescribing. The primary outcome is the mean change in patient activation score using the Patient Activation Measure short form Malay version (PAM-13-M) questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include the changes in waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, patient physical activity level, eating behaviour, perception of chronic illness care, satisfaction with patient–physician interaction, and perceived absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. Feasibility of implementing the intervention will be evaluated. This includes acceptability of the intervention, estimating the likely rate of participant recruitment and retention, appropriateness of the outcome measures, calculation of sample size, and the intervention’s potential effectiveness. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in Malaysia that aims to determine the feasibility of a multifaceted e-health intervention, as well as to indicate more useful aspects of this intervention for further exploration in a larger trial.

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.","Li, Xiaoming; Zeng, Wenbing; Li, Xiang; Chen, Haonan; Shi, Linping; Li, Xinghui; Xiang, Hongnian; Cao, Yang; Chen, Hui; Liu, Chen; Wang, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02324-w,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7132551/,PMC,10.1186/s12967-020-02324-w,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
137,"The influence of job satisfaction, resilience and work engagement on turnover intention among village doctors in China: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: As the gatekeepers of rural residents’ health, teams of village doctors play a vital role in improving rural residents’ health. However, the high turnover of village doctors, both individually and collectively, threaten the stability of village medical teams. This research evaluated the influence of job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement on the village doctors’ turnover intention, and explored the mediating role of work engagement and resilience between job satisfaction and the turnover intention of village doctors in China. METHODS: A quantitative study using a self-administered questionnaire containing mostly structured items was conducted among village doctors with a sample size of 2693 from 1345 rural clinics in Shandong province, China, during May and June 2019. All variables including demographic characteristics, job satisfaction, resilience, work engagement and turnover intention were based on available literature, and measured on a 5- or 6-point Likert scale. Such statistical methods as one-way ANOVA, bivariate correlation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used. RESULTS: Up to 46.9% of the subjects had a higher turnover intention and more than 26.3% of them had a medium turnover intention. The job satisfaction of village doctors could not only have a direct negative effect on turnover intention (β = − 0.37, p < 0.001), but also have an indirect effect through work engagement (β = − 0.04,=< 0.001). Meanwhile, work engagement also had a direct negative impact on turnover intention (β = − 0.13, p < 0.001), and resilience had an indirect negative impact on turnover intention through work engagement (β = − 0.09, p < 0.001). The above results of this study strongly confirmed that job satisfaction, resilience, and work engagement were early, powerful predicators of village doctors’ turnover intention. CONCLUSION: According to the results, the following should be taken seriously to improve job satisfaction: reasonable and fair income, effective promotion mechanism, fair social old-age security, reasonable workload, and strong psychological coping mechanisms for work stress. The turnover intention of village doctors could be reduced through improving job satisfaction, resilience and work engagement.","Zhang, Xuewen; Bian, Liyan; Bai, Xue; Kong, Dezhong; Liu, Li; Chen, Qing; Li, Ningxiu",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05154-0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133112/,PMC,10.1186/s12913-020-05154-0,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

139,The Crisis and Aftermath-II: Society and Economics,"This chapter mentions some other groundbreaking innovations and technological improvements that came along after the crisis. The recent attempts at creating digital currencies, famously known as cryptocurrencies, and their corresponding platform blockchain were some of these. How and why did they emerge? What do their inventions imply for our future? And why are they important? Sharing economy and memberships (as opposed to ownerships) are other examples of profound changes. Increasing use of shared goods, services like Uber and Airbnb, and the unstoppable trend of membership services like e-newspapers, e-libraries, and music streaming points to one conclusion: the end of the idea of ownership. On the governmental side, we have been observing an increasing inclination toward authoritarian states. Liberalism seems to have failed. People have been losing their trust in economic regimes. My argument in this chapter is that without the 2008 crisis, there would have never been these developments and innovations.","Erdem, Orhan",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43343-7_5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134311/,PMC,10.1007/978-3-030-43343-7_5,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05
140,Anosmia and ageusia are emerging as symptoms in patients with COVID-19: What does the current evidence say?,"There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19. This is of particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects. The purpose of this report was to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians. Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate. Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.","Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Rigg, Anne; Hopkins, Claire; Papa, Sophie; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed98,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134577/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed98,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
141,Upheaval in cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak,"On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID-19 outbreak. Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a government-approved isolation centre in Lagos State. This first mortality was that of a 67-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom. The novel COVID-19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer. Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery. This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients’ and oncology professionals’ physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies to ensure that cancer care is not completely disrupted during the outbreak.","Salako, Omolola; Okunade, Kehinde; Allsop, Matthew; Habeebu, Muhammedu; Toye, Mariam; Oluyede, Glory; Fagbenro, Gabriel; Salako, Babatunde",https://www.doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed97,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134578/,PMC,10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed97,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

Several investigations have been conducted to identify whether COVID-19 can be transmitted through the ocular route, and the conclusion is that it is a potential route but remains uncertain. Due to the face-to-face communication with patients, frequent exposure to tears and ocular discharge, and the unavoidable use of equipment which requires close proximity, ophthalmologists carry a high risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on 33 articles published by Chinese scholars, guidelines and clinical practice experience in domestic hospitals, we have summarized the Chinese experience through the lens of ophthalmology, hoping to make a contribution to protecting ophthalmologists and patients around the world.","Yu, A-Yong; Tu, Ruixue; Shao, Xu; Pan, Anpeng; Zhou, Kaijing; Huang, Jinhai",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40662-020-00187-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136699/,PMC,10.1186/s40662-020-00187-2,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
146,What is global health? Key concepts and clarification of misperceptions: Report of the 2019 GHRP editorial meeting,"The call for “Working Together to Build a Community of Shared Future for Mankind” requires us to improve people’s health across the globe, while global health development entails a satisfactory answer to a fundamental question: “What is global health?” To promote research, teaching, policymaking, and practice in global health, we summarize the main points on the definition of global health from the Editorial Board Meeting of Global Health Research and Policy, convened in July 2019 in Wuhan, China. The meeting functioned as a platform for free brainstorming, in-depth discussion, and post-meeting synthesizing. Through the meeting, we have reached a consensus that global health can be considered as a general guiding principle, an organizing framework for thinking and action, a new branch of sciences and specialized discipline in the large family of public health and medicine. The word “global” in global health can be subjective or objective, depending on the context and setting. In addition to dual-, multi-country and global, a project or a study conducted at a local area can be global if it (1) is framed with a global perspective, (2) intends to address an issue with global impact, and/or (3) seeks global solutions to an issue, such as frameworks, strategies, policies, laws, and regulations. In this regard, global health is eventually an extension of “international health” by borrowing related knowledge, theories, technologies and methodologies from public health and medicine. Although global health is a concept that will continue to evolve, our conceptualization through group effort provides, to date, a comprehensive understanding. This report helps to inform individuals in the global health community to advance global health science and practice, and recommend to take advantage of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China.","Chen, Xinguang; Li, Hao; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo; Abdullah, Abu S.; Huang, Jiayan; Laurence, Charlotte; Liang, Xiaohui; Ma, Zhenyu; Mao, Zongfu; Ren, Ran; Wu, Shaolong; Wang, Nan; Wang, Peigang; Wang, Tingting; Yan, Hong; Zou, Yuliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00142-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136700/,PMC,10.1186/s41256-020-00142-7,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

At University Hospitals, we have a mandate to offer high-end treatments to all cancer patients. However, in times of crisis we must learn to prioritize resources, especially personnel. Compromising oncological outcome will blur all statistics, therefore all measures must be taken with great caution.

148,"Epidemiological characteristics and transmissibility of shigellosis in Hubei Province, China, 2005 – 2017","BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is one of the main diarrhea diseases in developing countries. However, the transmissibility of shigellosis remains unclear. METHODS: We used the dataset of shigellosis cases reported between January 2005 and December 2017, from Hubei Province, China. A mathematical model was developed based on the natural history and the transmission mechanism of the disease. By fitting the data using the model, transmission relative rate from person to person (b) and from reservoir to person (b(w)), and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) were estimated. To simulate the contribution of b and b(w) during the transmission, we performed a “knock-out” simulation in four scenarios: A) b = 0 and b(w) = 0; B) b = 0; C) b(w) = 0; D) control (no intervention). RESULTS: A total of 130,770 shigellosis cases were reported in Hubei province, among which 13 cases were dead. The median annual incidence was 19.96 per 100,000 persons (range: 5.99 per 100,000 persons – 29.47 per 100,000 persons) with a decreased trend (trend χ(2) = 25,470.27, P < 0.001). The mean values of b and b(w) were 0.0898 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0851–0.0946) and 1.1264 × 10(− 9) (95% CI: 4.1123 × 10(− 10)–1.8416 × 10(− 9)), respectively. The “knock-out” simulation showed that the number of cases simulated by scenario A was almost the same as scenario B, and scenario C was almost the same as scenario D. The mean value of R(eff) of shigellosis was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.13–1.25) and decreased slightly with a Linear model until it decreased to an epidemic threshold of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.65–1.34) in 2029. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of shigellosis is still in high level. The transmissibility of the disease is low in Hubei Province. The transmission would be interrupted in the year of 2029.","Chen, Qi; Rui, Jia; Hu, Qingqing; Peng, Ying; Zhang, Hao; Zhao, Zeyu; Tong, Yeqing; Wu, Yang; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Guan, Xuhua; Chen, Tianmu",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-04976-x,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136996/,PMC,10.1186/s12879-020-04976-x,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
149,Fighting against the common enemy of COVID-19: a practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy — COVID-19.","Qian, Xu; Ren, Ran; Wang, Youfa; Guo, Yan; Fang, Jing; Wu, Zhong-Dao; Liu, Pei-Long; Han, Tie-Ru",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137400/,PMC,10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

156,CIRD-F: Spread and Influence of COVID-19 in China,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in China and the Chinese government took a series of policies to control the epidemic. Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections. At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries.","Zhou, Lingyun; Wu, Kaiwei; Liu, Hanzhi; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2168-1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137851/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2168-1,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

It is useful and urgent to consider the future trend of this outbreak. We establish the 4+1 penta-group model to predict the development of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this model, we use the collected data to calibrate the parameters, and let the recovery rate and mortality change according to the actual situation. Furthermore, we propose the BAT model, which is composed of three parts: simulation of the return rush (Back), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, to figure out the best return date for university students. We also discuss the impacts of some factors that may occur in the future, such as secondary infection, emergence of effective drugs, and population flow from Korea to China.","Huang, Ganyu; Pan, Qiaoyi; Zhao, Shuangying; Gao, Yucen; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2167-2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137853/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2167-2,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
159,Demand Analysis and Management Suggestion: Sharing Epidemiological Data Among Medical Institutions in Megacities for Epidemic Prevention and Control,"During the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemiological data is essential for controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations. Following Law of the People’s Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier. As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named “one-net management” on dynamic information monitoring. By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.","Cai, Qinyi; Mi, Yiqun; Chu, Zhaowu; Zheng, Yuanyi; Chen, Fang; Liu, Yicheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2166-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137855/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2166-3,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

Many articles have predicted the development of the epidemic. Most of them only use very basic SEIR model without considering the real situation. In this paper, we build a model called e-ISHR model based on SEIR model. Then we add hospital system and time delay system into the original model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 better. Besides, in order to take the government’s control and people’s awareness into consideration, we change our e-ISHR model into a 3-staged model which effectively shows the impact of these factors on the spread of the disease. By using this e-ISHR model, we fit and predict the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and China except Hubei. We also change some of parameters in our model.

162,Re-engineering the Cypriot healthcare service system,"BACKGROUND: The Cypriot healthcare system has undergone a number of major transformations since the induction of the Republic of Cyprus in the European Union over 10 years ago. Currently Cyprus is undergoing a major reform, namely the introduction of a primary care driven national healthcare system. The aim of the study was to assess the existing state of training, support, quality, guidelines and infrastructure towards a better healthcare system in Cyprus. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods study combining statistical data until October 2016 and workshop discussions delivered in Cyprus in November 2015. We used anonymised data provided: (1a) by the Cyprus Medical Association of all registered medical doctors up to October 2016; (1b); by the Ministry of Health (MoH) Health Monitoring Unit up to October 2016; (2) during a workshop organised with representatives from the Royal College of Physicians, the European Commission and the Health Insurance Organization. RESULTS: The gender ratio of men over women is disproportionate, with over 85% of the medical doctors undertaking their training in Greece, Eastern Europe and neighbouring countries, while the current record does not hold a relevant specialty information for 4 out of 10 doctors. The results show lack of statutory inspection systems, application of revalidation principles or implementation of peer-review clinical services on the island. There are eight proposed recommendations made by the workshop participants towards the transformation of the Cypriot healthcare system and the development of the Cyprus Quality Improvement Institute. These are aimed at addressing gaps in quality of care, adherence to clinical guidelines and implementation of audits, development of doctors’ revalidation and peer-review of clinical services, accreditation of service implementation, establishment of a statutory inspection system as well as the set-up of an incentives program as part of the general healthcare system (GHS) of Cyprus. CONCLUSIONS: Current efforts for the implementation of the new GHS in Cyprus call for adequate training and support of the medical workforce, transparent and safer quality of care provision through the implementation of clinical guidelines and capacity-building infrastructure.","Pallari, Elena; Samoutis, George; Rudd, Anthony",https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-5048-3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137859/,PMC,10.1186/s12913-020-5048-3,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
163,D(2)EA: Depict the Epidemic Picture of COVID-19,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused a global alert. To release social panic and guide future schedules, this article proposes a novel mathematical model, the Delay Differential Epidemic Analyzer (D(2)EA), to analyze the dynamics of epidemic and forecast its future trends. Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D(2)EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D(2)EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D(2)EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the quarantine measures and schedule the date to reopen Hubei Province.","Liu, Chenzhengyi; Zhao, Jingwei; Liu, Guohang; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2170-7,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137902/,PMC,10.1007/s12204-020-2170-7,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

169,"A Comprehensive Literature Review on the Clinical Presentation, and Management of the Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic. There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization. A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media. This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed. The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented. Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed. The composite collection of accredited studies on each of these subtopics of COVID-19 within this review will enable clarification and focus on the current status and direction in the planning of the management of this global pandemic.","Kakodkar, Pramath; Kaka, Nagham; Baig, MN",https://www.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7560,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138423/,PMC,10.7759/cureus.7560,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

174,Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: A new type of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is causing an increasing number of cases of pneumonia and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and traditional Chinese herbal medicine is being used for its treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess studies of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19 and traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ). Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P < 0.10. Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger’s test and Begg’s test, and Trim and Fill analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.

178,Influence of Community and Culture in the Ethical Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources in a Pandemic Situation: Deliberative Democracy Study,"BACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others’ views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L",https://www.doi.org/10.2196/18272,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141421/,PMC,10.2196/18272,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

180,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情下大学生心理健康状况及影响因素分析,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mental health status of college students during the epidemic of COVID-19 and identify the factors influencing the mental health of the students. METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSION: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086131/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06,20/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-20

The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time. AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential. To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation. For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients. During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.

184,新型冠状病毒SARS-CoV-2的变异和进化分析,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evolution and variation of SARS-CoV-2 during the epidemic starting at the end of 2019. METHODS: We downloaded the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the databases of GISAID and NCBI. Using the software for bioinformatics including MEGA-X, BEAST, and TempEst, we constructed the genomic evolution tree, inferred the time evolution signal of the virus, calculated the tMRCA time of the virus and analyzed the selection pressure of the virus during evolution. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of β Coronavirus genus together with bat coronavirus BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the ongoing epidemic showed a weak time evolution signal with an average tMRCA time of 73 days (95% CI: 38.9-119.3 days). No positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, but the former virus had a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS-CoV. The major cause for mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was the pressure of purification selection during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 may have emerged as early as November, 2019, originating most likely from bat-associated coronavirus. This finding may provide evidence for tracing the sources and evolution of the virus.",,https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.02,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086142/,PMC,10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.02,20/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-20

186,蒲公英果实征：9例新型冠状病毒肺炎的CT征象,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of the ""dandelion clock-like"" sign on chest CT for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia.

The article concludes with a discussion of technical and broader strategic approaches for confronting the effects of MAUP on our treatment and interpretation of areal data.","Buzzelli, Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10406-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10406-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10406-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
189,Globalization of Communicable Diseases,"Abstract Fueled by globalization and human behavior, communicable diseases pose a serious threat to humankind despite unparalleled technological advances. New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location—where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries, global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.","Oppong, Joseph R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10438-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
190,"Diseases, Emerging and Infectious","Abstract Emerging and infectious diseases have persisted as leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Caused by pathogens including bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi, they are known to pose serious health threats to the world's population dating back to ancient Egypt. In the 14th Century alone, infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20–45% of the world's population. The discovery of vaccines, coupled with improved sanitation, hygiene, and health care, witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases, although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases, low socioeconomic development, poverty, and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases, a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore, an effective surveillance system, and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.","Antabe, Roger; Ziegler, Bianca Rosa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10439-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
191,Interdisciplinarity,"Abstract Interdisciplinarity employs multiple academic fields of knowledge in order to create a comprehensive understanding of a globally relevant phenomenon, a region, or its people, and to find solutions to concrete problems. Interdisciplinarity evolved in the 20th century in response to the institutionalization and segmentation of academic research and major transitions in society. Many geography departments have interdisciplinary profiles, but the daily practice of interdisciplinarity depends on the networks of individual academics. The results of interdisciplinary collaboration include research books, textbooks, and journal articles, the market of which continues to diversify. Authors of interdisciplinary textbooks and teachers of interdisciplinary classes must pay special attention to teaching philosophy and communication skills in order to satisfy the needs of a heterogeneous body of students interested in interdisciplinary learning. Interdisciplinarity means different things in different contexts, and practices and challenges vary. Some see interdisciplinarity as an exciting opportunity, while others feel threatened by the downsides of crossing disciplinary boundaries.","Raento, Pauliina",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10659-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
192,15 An overview of automated room disinfection systems: When to use them and how to choose them,"Abstract Conventional disinfection methods are limited by reliance on the operator to ensure appropriate selection, formulation, distribution, and contact time of the agent. Automated room disinfection (ARD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the efficacy of terminal disinfection. The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapor (H2O2 vapor), aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP), and ultraviolet (UV) light. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, efficacy, process time, and ease of use. The choice of ARD system should be influenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation, and cost considerations.","Otter, J.A.; Yezli, S.; Barbut, F.; Perl, T.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102565-9.00015-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
193,Chapter 5 Bay Leaf,"Abstract Bay leaf (Laurus nobilis) is a perennial shrub belongs to the family laurel (Lauraceae). It has been cultivated throughout the European, tropical, subtropical, and Asian countries. It has been used for thousands of years for food flavoring, essential oil applications, and in traditional medicine. Mostly, it contains tannins, flavones, flavonoids, alkaloids, eugenol, linalool, methyl chavicol, and anthocyanins. The extent of each of these chemical constituents varies depending on the type of species or cultivars as well as cultivation conditions such as soil type, weather, irrigation, pruning, and other horticultural practices. Bay is an essential component of several industrial applications that range from food to cosmetics to pharmaceutical products. Bay leaf has many biologic activities such as wound healing activity, antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, antiviral activity, immunostimulant activity, anticholinergic activity, antifungal activity, insect repellant activity, anticonvulsant activity, antimutagenic activity, and analgesic and antiinflammatory activity.","Batool, Saima; Khera, Rasheed Ahmad; Hanif, Muhammad Asif; Ayub, Muhammad Adnan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-08-102659-5.00005-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
194,Pneumonia,"Abstract Pneumonia remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases in the world. The important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases especially in the elderly population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganisms. Because elderly individuals present with comorbidities, particular attention should be paid for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequently encountered pathogen. Enteric gram-negative rods, as well as anaerobes, should be considered in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Interventions for modifiable risk factors will reduce the risk of this infection. The adequacy of the initial antimicrobial therapy and determination of patients’ follow-up place is a key factor for prognosis. Also, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures. In this section it was focused on several aspects, including the atypical presentation of pneumonia in the elderly, the methods to evaluate the severity of illness, the appropriate take care place and the management with prevention strategies.","Banu, Buyukaydin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.62174-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
195,Liver Disease Associated with Non-Hepatitis Viruses,"Abstract Hepatitis is commonly associated with certain viruses labeled as “Hepatitis” viruses. However, many other viral infections can also affect the liver ranging from mild asymptomatic elevations of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure. This article will provide a brief overview on a variety of different viral infections that may be associated with significant liver pathology at least under certain conditions, for example, immunosuppression. This overview discusses key virological features, clinical presentation of associated liver disease and provides some information on diagnosis and an outline of treatment options. Thus, the overview can provide first orientation when infectious hepatitis is encountered in a patient that cannot be explained by the usual hepatitis viruses.","Spengler, Ulrich",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-801238-3.65782-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
196,Virus Taxonomy,"Abstract Virus taxonomy is the classification of viruses into categories called taxa and the development and implementation of a standardized nomenclature for taxa. Whereas virus taxonomy has been a niche subspecialty over many decades, the field has recently gained importance due to the exponentially increasing number of new viruses discovered by next-generation sequencing methods. The expanded known global virome and associated viral genome sequence space gradually morph virus taxonomy from a phenotype-based and inherently subjective process, focussing on shared or distinct, often arbitrarily chosen biophysical characteristics of virions to a significant subspecialty of systematic evolutionary biology. Indeed, current virus classification is increasingly performed using ever more complex phylogenetic approaches that move researchers closer to a rudimentary understanding of the origin, evolution, relatedness, and diversification of viruses over eons.","Kuhn, Jens H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21231-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
197,Antiviral Innate Immunity: Introduction ☆,"Abstract The concept of “innate immunity” includes all sorts of measures that exclude, inhibit, or slow down infections with little specificity and without much adaptation or generation of a long-lasting memory. The mammalian innate immune defenses described in this article comprise defensins, the complement system, nonspecific phagocytic and cytolytic leukocytes, and cytokines such as the antivirally active interferons. Since the type I (IFN-α/β) and type III interferon (IFN-λ) systems are our primary defense against viral infections, special attention will be paid to the virus-triggered induction of IFN transcription, the signaling activated by IFNs, and the antiviral factors expressed as a consequence.","Weber, Friedemann",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-809633-8.21290-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
198,"Chapter 2 Anatomical Uniqueness of the Mucosal Immune System (GALT, NALT, iBALT) for the Induction and Regulation of Mucosal Immunity and Tolerance","Abstract Mucosal surfaces lining the lung and the gut are constantly exposed to environmental antigens, commensal organisms, and pathogens. Consequently, the host’s immune system devotes enormous resources to the defense of these tissues. Although mucosal immune responses must be sufficiently strong to eliminate pathogens, they must also have mechanisms to prevent excessive inflammation and initiate epithelial repair. Importantly, mucosal immune responses are initiated and regulated by a variety of mucosal lymphoid tissues, collectively known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This chapter describes the unique developmental, architectural, and functional features of the MALT and how those features facilitate the local immune response at each site.","Silva-Sanchez, Aaron; Randall, Troy D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00002-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
199,Chapter 19 Current and New Approaches for Mucosal Vaccine Delivery,"Abstract Mucosal surfaces are the interface between the host’s internal milieu and the external environment, and they have dual functions, serving as physical barriers to foreign antigens and as accepting sites for vital materials. Mucosal vaccines are more favored to prevent mucosal infections from the portal of entry. Although mucosal vaccination has many advantages, licensed mucosal vaccines are scarce. The most widely studied mucosal routes are oral and intranasal. Licensed oral and intranasal vaccines are composed mostly of whole cell killed or live attenuated microorganisms serving as both delivery systems and built-in adjuvants. Future mucosal vaccines should be made with more purified antigen components, which will be relatively less immunogenic. To induce robust protective immune responses against well-purified vaccine antigens, an effective mucosal delivery system is an essential requisite. Recent developments in biomaterials and nanotechnology have enabled many innovative mucosal vaccine trials. For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier. Future mucosal vaccine carriers, regardless of administration routes, should have certain common characteristics. They should maintain stability in given environments, be mucoadhesive, and have the ability to target specific tissues and cells.","Rhee, Joon Haeng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00019-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
200,"Chapter 40 The Role of Innate Immunity in Regulating Rotavirus Replication, Pathogenesis, and Host Range Restriction and the Implications for Live Rotaviral Vaccine Development","Abstract Rotaviruses (RVs) are important causative agents of viral gastroenteritis in the young of most mammalian species studied, including humans, in which they are the most important cause of severe gastroenteritis worldwide despite the availability of several safe and effective vaccines. Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains. In this chapter, we review prevalent models of RV interactions with innate immune factors, viral strategies employed to regulate their function, and the implications of these findings for improved RV vaccine development.","Sen, Adrish; Ding, Siyuan; Greenberg, Harry B.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00041-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
201,Chapter 46 Harnessing γδ T Cells as Natural Immune Modulators,"Abstract There has been renewed interest in harnessing the power of the immune system as a countermeasure against infectious pathogens and cancers. One immune cell target in the development of these approaches is the γδ T cell. These cells are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against infectious agents and cancers, and they migrate to, and reside in, mucosal tissues. γδ T cells exhibit a broad array of natural (or constitutive) and induced effector functions, including antigen presentation, that can be fine-tuned depending on their stimulation. They express unique antigen receptors as well as nonantigen, innate immune type surface receptors that can be targeted. In this chapter, we will review the biology and the basis for use of γδ T cells as a therapeutic target. We will then summarize novel plant- and microbe-derived materials that enhance γδ T cell activity in animal models and humans that can be used as a new strategy for mucosal vaccine development.","Hedges, Jodi F.; Jutila, Mark A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00046-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
202,Chapter 48 Mucosal Vaccine Development for Veterinary and Aquatic Diseases,"Abstract Because most pathogens and food antigens enter the host via the mucosal surfaces, effective mucosal immunity is critical for maintaining homeostasis through immune regulation, tolerance, and induction of effective immune responses when needed. Thus the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues represent an important target for vaccination. Indeed, more than 20 years of research have clearly demonstrated the benefits of mucosal vaccination versus systemic vaccination. Such benefits include local induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as well as activation and maturation of mucosal dendritic cells, homing of effector cells to the mucosal surfaces, expression of specific host defense peptides, and other innate effector molecules. In addition, mucosal vaccination offers the opportunity to induce colostral and lactogenic immunity during pregnancy and the possibility of avoiding neutralization of early life vaccines by maternal antibodies, both of which are critical for protecting the most susceptible from infectious diseases. Moreover, mucosal administration offers the advantage of inducing both effective systemic immunity and mucosal immunity, enhancing vaccine efficacy and providing improved protection. A number of animal vaccines are already administered via the mucosal surfaces, with many more to come over the next few years. It is gratifying to see that veterinary vaccine development has yet again taken a leadership role in exploring innovative approaches and technologies to mucosal vaccination. For the veterinary field, considerations for mucosal vaccine development and use necessarily include costs (often pennies per dose), mass delivery that preferably avoids animal restraint, and economic and trade considerations. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the existing vaccine technologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.","Wilson, Heather L.; Gerdts, Volker; Babiuk, Lorne A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-811924-2.00048-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Rapid advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology have revolutionized the development of highly lethal and reliable biological agents with enhanced virulence, survivability, and drug resistance. In the current scenario, construction and misuse of next generation synthetic agents is not mere science fiction, but has become a harsh reality. Next generation bioweapons are potential bio-threats to peace, security, and well-being of the targeted country.

206,Chapter 11 Medical Management and Diagnostic Approaches,"Abstract This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. As is the case with all other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems so they can be communicated to appropriate veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed toward individual animals and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Topics include individual animal monitoring and care, signs of illness and distress, colony health management, components of microbiological monitoring programs, including agents commonly targeted and sentinel programs, quarantine, biological material screening, diagnostic testing methodologies, including culture, serology, molecular diagnostic and histopathology, test profiles and interpretation, management of disease outbreaks, and treatment and prevention strategies for infectious agents.","Otto, Glen M.; Myles, Matthew H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00011-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Extensive literature on the nutrition and physiology of GF rats and the expanding library of immunological reagents have increased the research utility of GF, GN, or DF rats. Such rats have been extensively used in metabolic experiments as nucleus seed stocks for the production of disease-free animals and as tools for infectious disease studies, among others. The chapter also presents research applications of GF rats that are particularly suitable for testing candidate viral carcinogens since they are uniquely free of all known viruses, for pathology studies in the distinguishing of primary mediation lesions from those associated with infections, and the study of the biological effects of radiation.","Carter, Philip B.; Norin, Elisabeth; Swennes, Alton G.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814338-4.00021-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to severe infections caused by some pathogens, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Pregnancy is associated with dynamic changes in maternal immune system that are critical for tolerance of the fetus. These changes could also play an important role in shaping maternal immune components that are transferred to the newborn infant following natural infection or vaccination to prevent infectious diseases in early life. As the momentum for maternal immunization is growing, there is a need to increase our understanding of the immunobiology of maternal immunization in order to better prevent infectious diseases in the pregnant women and the young infant.","Chu, Helen Y.; Marchant, Arnaud",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00003-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
211,Chapter 10 Respiratory syncytial virus,"Abstract Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality associated with lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. The World Health Organization recognizes the need to develop and implement prevention strategies to reduce the impact of RSV in early life as a global health priority. RSV vaccination during pregnancy is a feasible strategy to achieve this goal. Vaccines for maternal immunization against RSV are in active development and could be implemented in the near future within existing maternal-child health platforms. In addition, infant protection may be achieved through either passive antibody administration or active immunization, depending on infant health status, given that options for these complementary interventions are being developed in parallel to vaccines for maternal immunization.","Munoz, Flor M.; Englund, Janet A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00011-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00011-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814582-1.00011-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
212,Chapter 7 Herbal extracts as antiviral agents,"Abstract Phytotherapy, or herbalism, is defined as the usage of plants or herbs as medication to treat or prevent diseases in human and animals. The usage is gaining more attention among medical practitioners as well as large-scale livestock producers. A number of reports have shown the positive effects of herbal extracts as an antiviral agent used in animal feed or as a prophylaxis and remedy. Besides being a cheaper and safer alternative, the use of herbs may reduce the incidence of drug resistance and may modulate the immune system in preventing viral-related diseases. In this chapter, the antiviral effects of several herbs and their extracts against viruses in terms of the mechanism of action in targeting viral replication steps, the effects in the host and the application in animals will be discussed. The information given may aid in improving the health and increase the production of animals.","Yasmin, A.R.; Chia, S.L.; Looi, Q.H.; Omar, A.R.; Noordin, M.M.; Ideris, A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814700-9.00007-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814700-9.00007-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814700-9.00007-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
213,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.","Ennaji, Youssef; Khataby, Khadija; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00003-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
214,Chapter 4 Molecular Modeling of Major Structural Protein Genes of Avian Coronavirus: Infectious Bronchitis Virus Mass H120 and Italy02 Strains,"Abstract In Morocco, the epidemiological situation of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is very complex, because of the antigenic diversity associated with the emergence of new serotypes/genotypes and variants. The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010–14. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.","Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00004-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
215,Chapter 6 Involvement and Roles of Long Noncoding RNAs in the Molecular Mechanisms of Emerging and Reemerging Viral Infections,"Abstract The studies on the mechanisms of viral–host interactions in infections have been focusing on protein-coding sequences of the genome. Although it is essential to consider the nonprotein-coding part that represents approximately 80% of the human genome. Thus advances in sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of thousands of RNAs with low or no capacity to encode proteins but are exhibiting crucial biological functions. Long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of these ncRNAs that are longer than 200nt. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the involvement of these molecules in development and physiological processes, especially through their regulation of gene expression. LncRNAs are encoded in mammalian cells as well as in microorganisms and viruses. Several studies have found differential expressions of lncRNAs in response to viral infection of emerging viruses, which suggest important roles. In fact, they are involved in promoting viral replication, evading host immunity and regulating the host response to the infection. In addition, lncRNAs do not induce immune response compared to viral proteins; thus viruses might employ them as an effective strategy to invade their hosts. In this chapter, we discuss particularly the emerging virus–host interaction associated lncRNAs through addressing their involvement in the mechanisms underlying emerging viral infections as well as in the pathways of immune system in response to these infections. We also discuss the promising role of these noncoding transcripts as biomarkers for diagnosing viral pathologies.","Lamsisi, Maryame; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00006-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
216,Chapter 7 Scientific Advances in the Diagnosis of Emerging and Reemerging Viral Human Pathogens,"Abstract Despite scientific advances, the diagnosis of infectious diseases is primarily possible through vaccination and later by antibiotics. Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host–parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.","Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-814966-9.00007-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
217,Chapter 11 Baculovirus-Derived Vectors for Immunization and Therapeutic Applications,"Abstract Baculoviruses are arthropod-specific, enveloped viruses with circular, supercoiled double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid genomes. While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Finally, we review the baculovirus-derived products on the market and in the pipeline for biomedical and veterinary use.","Fabre, M.

218,Chapter 8 Forensic public health epidemiological and microbiological investigations for biosecurity,"Abstract Deliberate dissemination of a biological agent via several different routes presents the latest challenge to global public health security. Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern. This chapter discusses how epidemiology integrated with laboratory science can be used to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins—especially for attribution purposes.","Khan, Ali S.; Amara, Philip S.; Morse, Stephen A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00008-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
219,Chapter 14 The use of host factors in microbial forensics,"Abstract Advances have been made in the forensic analysis of microbes and toxins. An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator, and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response to microbial antigens including vaccine-induced immunity and detection of antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. This chapter presents central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a representative example, which, in the appropriate context, has a high potential of providing evidence that may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim. This chapter also presents information about the immune system so that the interested reader can have a fuller understanding of the immune response in general.","Schutzer, Steven E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00014-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
220,Chapter 20 Design of genomic signatures for pathogen identification and characterization,"Abstract Once the genome of a microbial organism has been sequenced, it becomes possible to utilize portions of the genome, known as “signatures” to identify when that organism is present in a complex clinical or environmental sample. Genomic signatures can be at multiple levels of resolution depending on the questions being asked. (“Is this white powder anthrax?”; “Does this white powder match any of the anthrax samples taken from every laboratory in the United States that possesses anthrax?”) Multiple technologies exist to turn abstract genomic signatures into assays that can interrogate complex samples with varying degrees of speed, sensitivity, specificity, and cost. The recent flood of microbial genomic data has complicated the task of designing genomic signatures.","Slezak, Tom; Hart, Bradley; Jaing, Crystal",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00020-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00020-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-815379-6.00020-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

However, a parallel commitment to education and training in this field is needed to prepare the next generation of scientists. Education and training are needed to: Improve first responder preparation and awareness, essential to public safety and preservation of the evidence integrity; Provide a larger pool of trained microbial forensics practitioners and; Educate the public and policy makers on the capabilities and limitations of microbial forensics.

Among them, DNA sensors, with oligonucleotides as recognition elements, are being widely utilized for many applications, mainly diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this experiment, a hybridization-based genosensor was designed on a 100-nm sputtered gold film.

225,Chapter 20 The potential of exosomes as theragnostics in various clinical situations,"Abstract Exosomes are membrane-bound cargo measuring 30–140nm comprised of a lipid bilayer containing various proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and bioactive lipids that can be transferred between cells. They have been shown to be produced and released by many different types of healthy and diseased cells. Exosomes are secreted by all types of cells in culture, and are also found in various body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes are essential for healthy physiological as well as pathological processes. In addition to their normal function, exosomes are involved in the development and progression of various diseases, potentiating cellular stress and damage. Pathogens take advantage of exosome release from infected host cells by manipulating host-derived exosomes to evade the immune system responses. Exosomes are involved in other pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases, heart failure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, osteoporosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, we can exploit exosomes as biomarkers and vaccines and modify them rationally for therapeutic interventions including tissue engineering. Further studies on exosomes will explore their potential and provide new methodology for effective clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies: such uses can be called exosome theragnostics. This chapter reviews the potential theragnostic (diagnostic and therapeutic) application of exosomes in major organ systems in clinical fields.","Kang, Ju-Seop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816053-4.00020-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
226,Chapter 1 Sialic acid and biology of life: An introduction,"Abstract Sialic acids are important molecule with high structural diversity. They are known to occur in higher animals such as Echinoderms, Hemichordata, Cephalochorda, and Vertebrata and also in other animals such as Platyhelminthes, Cephalopoda, and Crustaceae. Plants are known to lack sialic acid. But they are reported to occur in viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Deaminated neuraminic acid although occurs in vertebrates and bacteria, is reported to occur in abundance in the lower vertebrates. Sialic acids are mostly located in terminal ends of glycoproteins and glycolipids, capsular and tissue polysialic acids, bacterial lipooligosaccharides/polysaccharides, and in different forms that dictate their role in biology. Sialic acid play important roles in human physiology of cell-cell interaction, communication, cell-cell signaling, carbohydrate-protein interactions, cellular aggregation, development processes, immune reactions, reproduction, and in neurobiology and human diseases in enabling the infection process by bacteria and virus, tumor growth and metastasis, microbiome biology, and pathology. It enables molecular mimicry in pathogens that allows them to escape host immune responses. Recently sialic acid has found role in therapeutics. In this chapter we have highlighted the (i) diversity of sialic acid, (ii) their occurrence in the diverse life forms, (iii) sialylation and disease, and (iv) sialic acid and therapeutics.","Ghosh, Shyamasree",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816126-5.00001-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816126-5.00001-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816126-5.00001-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
227,Chapter 2 Sialoglycans and genetically engineered plants,Abstract Plants express N-glycosylation pathways and produce N-glycosylated proteins but differ from the mammalian-type proteins. Therefore attempts are made to design and engineer plant glycosylation pathways that can produce mammalian-type glycosylated moieties so that large quantities of biopharmaceuticals compatible to the human body can be produced. Most of the studies of plant expression systems for molecular farming have been conducted on Nicotiana sp. and genetic engineering and molecular biology tools have enabled the generation of glycoengineered plant for human use in the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins.

230,Chapter 2 Molecular basis of genetic variation of viruses error-prone replication,"Abstract Genetic variation is a necessity of all biological systems. Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate. A distinction is made between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant mutation and recombination.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00002-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
231,Chapter 4 Interaction of virus populations with their hosts,"Abstract Viral population numbers are extremely large compared with those of their host species. Population bottlenecks are frequent during the life cycle of viruses and can reduce viral populations transiently to very few individuals. Viruses have to confront several types of constraints that can be divided into basal, cell-dependent, and organism-dependent constraints. Viruses overcome them exploiting a number of molecular mechanisms, with an important contribution of population numbers and genome variation. The adaptive potential of viruses is reflected in modifications of cell tropism and host range, escape to components of the host immune response, and capacity to alternate among different host species, among other phenotypic changes. Despite a fitness cost of most mutations required to overcome a selective constraint, viruses can find evolutionary pathways that ensure their survival in equilibrium with their hosts.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00004-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
232,Chapter 6 Virus population dynamics examined with experimental model systems,"Abstract Experimental evolution permits exploring the effect of controlled environmental variables in virus evolution. Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimens. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses. The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00006-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
233,Chapter 7 Long-term virus evolution in nature,"Abstract Viruses spread to give rise to epidemics and pandemics, and some key parameters that include virus and host population numbers determine virus persistence or extinction in nature. Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another facet of biological complexity.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00007-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
234,Chapter 8 Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control,"Abstract Medical interventions to prevent and treat viral disease constitute evolutionary forces that may modify the genetic composition of viral populations that replicate in an infected host and influence the genomic composition of those viruses that are transmitted and progress at the epidemiological level. Given the adaptive potential of viruses in general and the RNA viruses in particular, the selection of viral mutants that display some degree of resistance to inhibitors or vaccines is a tangible challenge. Mutant selection may jeopardize control of the viral disease. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics explained in the preceding chapters. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines, and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. It also follows that sociopolitical action to interrupt virus replication and spread as soon as possible is as important as scientifically sound treatment designs to control viral disease on a global scale.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00008-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
235,Chapter 9 Trends in antiviral strategies,"Abstract Viral populations are true moving targets regarding the genomic sequences to be targeted in antiviral designs. Experts from different fields have expressed the need for new paradigms for antiviral interventions and viral disease control. This chapter reviews several antiviral strategies that aim at counteracting the adaptive capacity of viral quasispecies. The proposed designs are based on combinations of different antiviral drugs and immune modulators, or in the administration of virus-specific mutagenic agents, in an approach termed lethal mutagenesis of viruses. It consists of decreasing viral fitness by an excess of mutations that render viral proteins suboptimal or nonfunctional. Viral extinction by lethal mutagenesis involves several sequential, overlapping steps that recapitulate the major concepts of intrapopulation interactions and genetic information stability discussed in preceding chapters. Despite the magnitude of the challenge, the chapter closes with some optimistic prospects for effective control of viruses displaying error-prone replication, based on the combined targeting of replication fidelity and the induction of the innate immune response.","Domingo, Esteban",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816331-3.00009-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
236,Chapter 2 Metagenomics revealing new virus species in farm and pet animals and aquaculture,"Abstract Viral metagenomics is slowly taking over the traditional and widely used molecular techniques for the investigation of pathogenic viruses responsible for illness and inflicting great economic burden on the farm animal industry. Owing to the continued improvements in sequencing technologies and the dramatic reduction of per base costs of sequencing the use of next generation sequencing have been key factors in this progress. Discoveries linked to viral metagenomics are expected to be beneficial to the field of veterinary medicine starting from the development of better diagnostic assays to the design of new subunit vaccines with minimal investments. With these achievements the research has taken a giant leap even toward the better healthcare of animals and, as a result, the animal sector could be growing at an unprecedented pace.","Kaszab, Eszter; Doszpoly, Andor; Lanave, Gianvito; Verma, Atul; Bányai, Krisztián; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Marton, Szilvia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00002-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
237,Chapter 13 Biotechnological innovations in farm and pet animal disease diagnosis,"Abstract The application of innovative diagnostic technologies for the detection of animal pathogens at an early stage is essential in restricting the economic loss incurred due to emerging infectious animal diseases. The desirable characteristics of such diagnostic methods are easy to use, cost-effective, highly sensitive, and specific, coupled with the high-throughput detection capabilities. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still the most common assays used for the detection of animal pathogens across the globe. However, utilizing the principles of ELISA and PCR, several serological and molecular technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid, and point-of-care (POC) detection such as lateral flow assays, biosensors, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular platforms for field-level detection of animal pathogens. Furthermore, animal disease diagnostics need to be updated regularly to capture new, emerging and divergent infectious pathogens, and biotechnological innovations are helpful in fulfilling the rising demand for such diagnostics for the welfare of the society. Therefore, this chapter primarily describes and discusses in detail the serological, molecular, novel high-throughput, and POC assays to detect pathogens affecting farm and companion animals.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Verma, Atul; Kumar, Naveen; Deol, Pallavi; Kumar, Deepak; Ghosh, Souvik; Dhama, Kuldeep",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00013-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
238,Chapter 19 Advances in structure-assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases,"Abstract The latest advancements in drug development are structure-assisted and computer-aided identification, design, and synthesis of target-specific antiviral. Structural virology of animal viruses has made valuable contribution to our understanding of viruses in general, replication, evolution, and interaction with the host. Structure–function relation studies are definitely the need of the hour for rational design of drugs and vaccines to effectively treat animal viral diseases. These studies are important for economical, veterinary, and human medical perspectives. X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy techniques elaborate the structure–function relation studies by utilizing various computational approaches for structure-assisted designing of drug molecules and antiviral against viruses. Availability of protein three-dimensional structures, high-performance computing, data management software, and internet are enhancing the modern day drug discovery process. Computational tools offer the advantage of delivering new drug candidates more quickly and at a lower cost. Various viral proteins that are necessary for the survival of the virus inside the host are discussed in this chapter such as viral polymerase, helicase, protease, etc. Various antiviral drug molecules identified and designed on the basis of the structure of viral proteins which are highlighted, and disclosed details of the available inhibitors and potential antiviral are discussed. Further improvement in identified inhibitors, the need of novel structure-based drugs and their clinical testing is emphasized. This chapter describes briefly the structural techniques and advances made in animal virology toward structure-based identification and development of antiviral for treatment of animal viruses. In the future, the studies discussed may serve as the basis for development of potential antiviral against animal viral diseases.","Tomar, Shailly; Mahajan, Supreeti; Kumar, Ravi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00019-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00019-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00019-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
239,Chapter 20 Vaccines the tugboat for prevention-based animal production,"Abstract The world population is growing at a faster rate day-by-day and the demands for animal products are also increasing to meet the food security worldwide. For sustained production of animals products, healthy livestock and poultry farming are the major concerns as animals are susceptible to various infectious agents viz. bacteria, virus, and parasites leading to huge economical losses in the form of livestock’s morbidity and mortality. Besides, zoonotic nature of some infectious pathogens of animals is also raising concern for human safety. Vaccination of animals against various diseases present in different geographical regions is a best known strategy for prevention of different disease outbreaks both in organized and unorganized livestock and poultry sectors. Vaccines had played a major role in eradication of different dreaded diseases of livestock sectors globally. In this article we have discussed different vaccine types, various vaccine strategies used for the development of more efficacious and safe vaccines and commercially available vaccines for livestock and poultry.","Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi; Gupta, Vikas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816352-8.00020-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
240,Chapter 10 Genes conferring immunity against viral infections,"Abstract Immunity against viral infection is different from that for other infections. The virus utilizes the host’s immune mechanism for its survival and infection. Innate immune reaction is initially activated by conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, pattern recognition receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, MDA5, LGP2, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3 and TLR7. Some important molecules responsible for viral infection include cytokines and chemokines. The current chapter includes the basic mechanism of action of immune-response genes and a list of important genes and their protein IDs. Chemokines include CCL19 and CCL21, and reactivate antiviral CCR7, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, a CC chemokine, and interleukin 8, an interferon-stimulated gene.","Pal, Aruna; Chakravarty, A.K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00010-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
241,Chapter 19 Disease resistance for different livestock species,"Abstract This chapter deals with progress in disease resistance for the livestock population species-wise and describes the progress that occurred globally. Certain genes were identified for mastitis resistance and the strategies for genomic control of mastitis are discussed. Gene-edited tuberculosis-resistant cattle were developed for the first time with CRISPR/Cas 9 technology with NRAMP gene insert. Similarly studies are in progress for the development of trypanosomiasis-resistant cattle at ILRI. Genomic insights were discussed for disease resistance for goat against gastrointestinal nematode infestation, coccidiosis, peste des petits ruminants, and scrapie. Similarly genomic resistance was also discussed for sheep, discussing the mechanism of disease resistance with MHC, antibody and T cell response, cytokines, and receptors. Genes identified for bacterial diarrhoeal resistance as K88, F18 (an intestinal receptor) for resistance to bacterial infection in pig. Gene-edited pigs were developed against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and transmissible gastroenteritis caused by corona virus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Insights on the omics technologies developed and studied were discussed for livestock species. Genomic control on various diseases of poultry is discussed as salmonellosis, avian influenza, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease with advanced genomic and allied techniques for its control as RNA interference, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, transcriptomics, etc. A new concept on natural antibodies was discussed.","Pal, Aruna; Chakravarty, A.K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816406-8.00019-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
242,Chapter 3 Biological HRPs in wastewater,"Abstract Biological high-risk pollutants (HRPs) have become a serious threat to human health worldwide, and wastewater is one of the major sources of them in a natural environment. Despite the long history of wastewater research, comprehensive understanding of the role and behavior of HRPs during wastewater treatment is still limited owing to the complexity of the community. In recent decades, the rapid development of molecular tools, especially the wide application of next generation sequencing technologies, helps to unravel the community composition, structure, and dynamic variation in wastewater. Overall, this chapter mainly focuses on biological HRPs, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater. The characteristics, classification, fates, functions, and health implications of these HRPs are introduced in detail. Moreover, the biogeography of HRPs is a research hotspot in recent years, and available information is also summarized in this chapter. Finally, we also propose the future research needs of HRPs in wastewater after the comprehensive summary of the existing research reports. This chapter is wished to be helpful for beginners to quickly understand the biological HRPs in wastewater.","Jia, Shuyu; Zhang, Xuxiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816448-8.00003-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816448-8.00003-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816448-8.00003-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
243,"Chapter 15 Analysis of alkaloids (indole alkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids, tropane alkaloids)","Abstract Alkaloids are a large cluster of molecules found in Mother Nature all over the world. They are all secondary compounds and collection of miscellaneous elements and biomolecules, derived from amino acids or from transamination. This diverse chemical group is categorized, based on the amino acids that deliver their nitrogen atom and part of their skeleton. Alkaloids from a similar origin or having the same basic nucleus may have dissimilar biosynthetic pathways and different biological activity. They are derived from l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, anthranilic acid or acetate, l-histidine, l-ornithine, nicotinic acid, and l-lysine. Apart from other types of alkaloids, indole, tropane, and isoquinoline alkaloids are very important. People from all over the world are using them in their everyday life. Alkaloids can also have an animal origin, which may be endogenous or exogenous. This chapter highlights the phytochemistry of the main representatives among the diverse group of alkaloids. This chapter also focuses on their extraction, purification, fractionation, identification, and quantification procedures. A fundamental understanding of the biological activity of important alkaloids is also highlighted in this chapter. With the potential of revealing new compounds and diverse pharmacological properties, alkaloids still embrace a great potential for the future of drug discovery.","Dey, Prasanta; Kundu, Amit; Kumar, Anoop; Gupta, Meenakshi; Lee, Byung Mu; Bhakta, Tejendra; Dash, Suvakanta; Kim, Hyung Sik",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816455-6.00015-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

The use of different types of nanomaterials, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and metallic nanoparticles, was described, highlighting that graphene represents a rising star in the plethora of nanomaterials. Among the different transducers, the chapter describes the electrochemical and optical (bio)sensors, being the most promising devices. The use of materials at the nanodimension scale provides several improvements in terms of analytical features including sensitivity, rapidity of response, selectivity, and robustness, demonstrating the huge advantage of using the nanomaterials over the micromaterials in the development of smart and high-performant analytical tools.","Arduini, Fabiana; Cinti, Stefano; Scognamiglio, Viviana; Moscone, Danila",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-816699-4.00013-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

We will evaluate the feeding of calves and heifers along with some brief practical feeding recommendations for dry and prepartum cows.","Erickson, Peter S.; Kalscheur, Kenneth F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00009-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00009-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00009-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
246,Chapter 20 Reproductive management of poultry,"Abstract Based on data from the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization, about 120 million metric tons of poultry meat were produced globally in 2016. In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today's poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire Müllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.","Scanes, Colin G.; Butler, Leasea D.; Kidd, Michael T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817052-6.00020-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
247,Chapter 18 Use of artificial intelligence in infectious diseases,"Abstract Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms belonging to the class of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases. This chapter covers a series of applications selectively chosen to showcase how artificial intelligence is moving the field of infectious disease further and how it helps institutions to better tackles them, especially in low-income countries.","Agrebi, Said; Larbi, Anis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817133-2.00018-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
248,8 Epidemic modeling and control of HIV/AIDS dynamics in populations under external interactions: A worldwide challenge,"Abstract In this chapter the problem of the interaction between groups of subjects singularly characterized by a specific infectious disease is addressed. The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals. These effects have been reported in numerous figures showing the results of numerical simulations.","Di Giamberardino, Paolo; Iacoviello, Daniela",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817461-6.00008-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
249,Chapter 7 Nanoparticle-based vaccines opportunities and limitations,"Abstract Infectious diseases are the tip of the iceberg in the economic burden of the developing countries, due to the resistance of the pathogens to antibiotics and the lack of vaccines. The vaccines have become a big challenge in the last decades, where the attention has been focused on scientific challenges such as new vaccine development and adjuvants or delivery systems. The classical vaccines were developed from live-attenuated or killed organisms, such as influenza, smallpox, and BCG, as well as subunits such as Hepatitis B. The attenuated vaccines carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under immunosuppression conditions. The development of subunit vaccines without risk are considered as an essential need in combination with adequate delivery systems to obtain desired cell and humoral immune responses against infectious diseases. In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.","Diaz-Arévalo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817778-5.00007-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
250,Chapter 16 Shikimic acid as intermediary model for the production of drugs effective against influenza virus,"Abstract This chapter explains the application of shikimic acid as preventive medicine for the outbreak of swine or Avian flu due to H1N1 virus. Shikimic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid), a natural organic compound, is generally utilized as a starting material for industrial synthesis of the antiviral oseltamivir, a drug against the H1N1 influenza virus. It is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan), and most alkaloids of plants and microorganisms. Plant and microbial sources are the only sources of shikimic acid. Being a deadly viral disease, influenza causes the death of around half a million people each year. A neuraminidase present on the surface of the virus is the most important factor for viral reproduction by contributing to the release of viruses from infected host cells and hence the treatment of influenza can only be possible by neuraminidase inhibitors. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or Tamiflu derived from shikimic acid pathway have been found to be potent influenza viral neuraminidase inhibitors against most influenza strains.","Priyanka Singh, ; Gupta, Ena; Neha Mishra, ; Mishra, Pragya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00016-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
251,Chapter 17 Antimicrobial lead compounds from marine plants,"Abstract Marine environment is a home to a very wide diversity of flora and fauna, which includes an array of genetically diverse coastline and under seawater plant species, animal species, microbial species, their habitats, ecosystems, and supporting ecological processes. The Earth is home to an estimated 10million species, of which a large chunk belongs to marine environment. Marine plants are a store house of a variety of antimicrobial compounds like classes of marine flavonoids—flavones and flavonols, terpenoids, alkaloids, peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, polyketides, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and steroids. Lot of research today is directed toward marine species, which have proved to be a potent source of structurally widely diverse and yet highly bioactive secondary metabolites. Varied species of phylum Porifera, algae including diatoms, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Dinoflagellata, Chrysophyta, cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta, bacteria, fungi, and weeds have been exploited by mankind for their inherent indigenous biological antimicrobial compounds, produced under the extreme stressful underwater conditions of temperature, atmospheric pressure, light, and nutrition. The present study aims at presenting a brief review of bioactive marine compounds possessing antimicrobial potency.","Kurhekar, Jaya Vikas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00017-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00017-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-817890-4.00017-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
252,Chapter 7 Biofiltration technique for removal of waterborne pathogens,"Abstract Pathogenic agents such as protozoa, bacteria, virus, and helminths disseminate among human community via ingestion of contaminated water and pose a serious concern to public health. Biological filtration method of disinfection is the key step in centralized multistep and decentralized point-of-use water treatment system. A biofilm of indigenous microorganisms fixed on solid surface, called biofilter, is an eco-friendly and economic technique for removal of pollutants and pathogens. Stone, gravel, sand, soil, compost, mesoporous mineral stone, wood chips, etc., exemplify solid bed medium which provide enhanced surface area for microbial adherence and water retention. Slow sand filter (SSF) characterized by slow flow rate (0.1–0.2m3/h) and a biological layer over filter bed called schmutzdecke is fairly efficient in removal of coliform microorganisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, total coliform and fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, bacteriophage, and MS2 virus from wastewater. Rapid sand filter characterized by coarser sand and higher flow rate than SSF removes indicator microorganisms efficiently. Stormwater biofilter is popular and effective method for removal of pathogen and involves biological activity and physical retention of pathogen on filter media. Microbial diversity, inoculum size, pH and moisture of medium, temperature, and nutrient content are key parameters governing optimum performance of biofilter system. Therefore, biofiltration can be an efficient bioremediation technology for pathogen removal.","Maurya, Anurag; Singh, Manoj Kumar; Kumar, Sushil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00007-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
253,Chapter 10 Bioaugmentation for the treatment of waterborne pathogen contamination water,"Abstract Bioaugmentation is an eco-friendly and economically viable approach for enhanced degradation of pollutants and pathogens by addition of pregrown microbe or microbial cocultures in the medium. Microorganisms from different ecological conditions and engineered microbes capable to produce versatile enzymes and bioproducts are added to native microbial population for in situ treatment of wastewater. Bacterial pathogen borne in wastewater is an important concern for public health because they are not only associated with environmental damage, morbidity, and mortality but also cause economic loss connected with physical and chemical methods in wastewater treatment. Bacteriophages are natural killer of bacteria; they can be used as an alternative, cost-effective, biological method for waterborne bacterial pathogen control. Legionella pneumophila is the most tracked waterborne pathogen requiring specific treatment conditions because despite of biocides use, they are able to persist in water supplies with the help of multispecies biofilms and phagocytic protists. This type of pathogens can be biologically controlled through native complex communities fight for nutrients by means of antagonistic molecules as war weapons. Bioinoculation of heterotrophic bacterial strains in different wastewater treatment systems improves the process of pathogenic bacteria removal. The antagonist substances produced by the inoculated strains are responsible for bacterial pathogen inactivation.","Singh, Manoj Kumar; Maurya, Anurag; Kumar, Sushil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00010-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
254,Chapter 19 Nanomaterials for removal of waterborne pathogens opportunities and challenges,"Abstract As the nanotechnological applications have taken over in different fields, their applications for water and wastewater treatment is also surfacing as a fast-developing and very promising area. Recent advancements in nanotechnological science and engineering advise that many of the waterborne pathogens could be culminated or debilitated using nanobiosorbents, nanocatalysts, bioactive nanoparticles, nanostructured catalytic membranes, nanobioreactors, nanoparticle-enhanced filtration among other products, and processes resulting from the development of nanotechnology. A detailed insight has been provided for advanced techniques such as photochemical (photocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes) applications of metal oxide nanoparticles, nanomembrane technology, bioinspired nanomaterials, and nanotechnological innovations (nano-Ag, fullerenes, nanotubes, and molecularly imprinted polymers, etc.), which prove to be highly potential as well as promising and cost-effective. However, there are still some shortcomings and challenges that must be overcome which will be looked upon in this chapter.","Ojha, Ankita",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00019-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00019-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818783-8.00019-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
255,Chapter 4 Current trends of antimicrobials used in food animals and aquaculture,"Abstract Human population has been increasing rapidly, which ultimately increases human consumption, especially, animal protein requirements. Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe's emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration. The contribution of resistant microbes from various sources seems to be the major base of resistance in the environment. However, strict policies and regulations for antimicrobial usage in food animals and aquaculture must be made and applied. It is important to prevent their negative effects in humans, food animals, aquaculture, and the environment.","Ibrahim, Muhammad; Ahmad, Fiaz; Yaqub, Bushra; Ramzan, Ayesha; Imran, Ayesha; Afzaal, Muhammad; Mirza, Safdar Ali; Mazhar, Iqra; Younus, Muhammad; Akram, Qaisar; Ali Taseer, Muhammad Sulman; Ahmad, Ali; Ahmed, Sarfraz",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-818882-8.00004-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
256,Chapter 2 Syndromic surveillance using web data: a systematic review,"Abstract During the recent years, a lot of debate is taken place about the evolution of Smart Healthcare systems. Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists. Finally, these new systems can help improve the standards of human life.","Samaras, Loukas; García-Barriocanal, Elena; Sicilia, Miguel-Angel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819043-2.00002-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

258,Chapter 3 Viral Emerging Pathogen Evolution,"Abstract The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases throughout history has been the product of the interaction of infectious agents, immunity, selective pressure, and environmental factors. The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.","Rodríguez, Virginia; Lagares, Alfredo; Arteaga, Heiser; Mattar, Salim; Ruiz, Luis Carlos",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00003-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
259,Chapter 4 Human Viruses: Emergence and Evolution,"Abstract Many new viruses have emerged in the last five decades. These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between human–animal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities. Vector-borne diseases also have a natural advantage of dissemination.","Sudhan, Shashi S.; Sharma, Preeti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00004-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
260,Chapter 6 Ecoepidemiology of Alphaviruses and Flaviviruses,"Abstract Within the ecosystems, the balance is important since the populations maintain their size and the food habits that are constant over time; in contrast, the disappearance of natural sources or the alteration of habitat at different levels can cause major changes in the very structure of the ecosystem. Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming, climatic changes, which together with globalization, increased trade, the shortening of distances thanks to transport, the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes, which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently, some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors, such as dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya virus, have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. Vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks; wild birds are reservoirs for the West Nile virus, small wild mammals such as rodents, bats, and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses, and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown.","Guzmán, Camilo; Calderón, Alfonso; Mattar, Salim; Tadeu-Figuereido, Luiz; Salazar-Bravo, Jorge; Alvis-Guzmán, Nelson; Martinez, Elias Zakzuk; González, Marco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00006-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

262,Chapter 8 The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus: An Emerging Virus of Global Threat,"Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, almost 2000 cases have been reported from 27 countries, with Saudi Arabia being the epicenter. This newly emerging virus is highly pathogenic and has a case mortality rate of 35%. It is similar to the CoV causing severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in that both belong to the genus beta CoVs that are of zoonotic origin and cause lower respiratory infection. The natural reservoir for MERS-CoV remains unknown. Serological studies indicate that most dromedary camels in the Middle East have been infected with this virus, and they maybe the potential intermediate host. However, the mode of transmission from camels to humans is poorly understood. The majority of confirmed human cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission, most probably via respiratory route. Patients most at risk of developing severe MERS-CoV infection appear to be those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is considered an ongoing public health problem, particularly for the Middle East region. In this chapter, we outline the prevailing information regarding the emergence and epidemiology of this virus, its mode of transmission and pathogenicity, its clinical features, and the potential strategies for prevention.","Khan, Gulfaraz; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00008-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
263,Chapter 16 Dengue Virus,"Abstract Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It is a single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus with 10,700 bases. The genus Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50–200 million people annually, putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20,000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement, and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype, but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development, developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence, the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.","Murugesan, Amudhan; Manoharan, Mythreyee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00016-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
264,Chapter 27 Emergence and Reemergence of Viral Zoonotic Diseases: Concepts and Factors of Emerging and Reemerging Globalization of Health Threats,"Abstract The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

IBV is well studied worldwide; nevertheless, in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. In spite of regular vaccination with Massachusetts (Mass) strain has been available to control IB for many decades in MENA regions, which it is most commonly used, the protection is not occurred. However, the continuity of the spread of IBV has shown the emergence of multiple variant strains due to the frequent point of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene hypervariable regions. All the reported IBV variants circulate in the form of several serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized by current vaccines. This emergence remains a problem for the poultry industry and vaccine manufacturers. Therefore the objective of this present chapter, which is reported for the first time, aims to establish phylogenic relationship among emerging strains in MENA regions.","Khataby, Khadija; Kasmi, Yassine; Souiri, Amal; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00033-8,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
266,Chapter 40 Waterborne Transmission of Enteric Viruses and Their Impact on Public Health,"Abstract Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.","Bouseettine, Rihab; Hassou, Najwa; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00040-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
267,Chapter 18 Electrochemical virus detections with nanobiosensors,"Abstract Infectious diseases are caused from pathogens, which need a reliable and fast diagnosis. Today, expert personnel and centralized laboratories are needed to afford much time in diagnosing diseases caused from pathogens. Recent progress in electrochemical studies shows that biosensors are very simple, accurate, precise, and cheap at virus detection, for which researchers find great interest in this field. The clinical levels of these pathogens can be easily analyzed with proposed biosensors. Their working principle is based on affinity between antibody and antigen in body fluids. The progress still continues on these biosensors for accurate, rapid, reliable sensors in future.","Kaya, Sariye Irem; Karadurmus, Leyla; Ozcelikay, Goksu; Bakirhan, Nurgul K.; Ozkan, Sibel A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00017-7,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
268,Chapter 24 Nanosensor networks for health-care applications,"Abstract Functionalized transistors provide effective sensors for a variety of viruses (Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome), toxins (botulinum), cancers (breast and prostate), and disease or injury biomarkers (troponin, cerebrospinal fluid). A hallmark of this approach is high specificity, rapid response (<5minutes), and ability to be integrated with wireless data transmission capabilities.

269,Chapter 30 Virus detection using nanosensors,"Abstract A smart city has a bright and sustainable way to integrate services together and can monitor/control them using intelligent devices called sensors to preserve the efficient utilization of resources. Sensors are distributed everywhere in smart cities. They can be employed to monitor health care, transportation, infrastructure, building, surveillance, government, etc. Especially, nanosensors hold great impact to turn the current techniques for the detection of viruses. With the facility of real-time sensing, there is no need for regular inspections for maintenance and surveying, which results in reduced costs and time wastage. Definitely, common sensing platforms need persistent updates to address increasing doubts in the detection of viruses as they modify quickly and spread from person to person, pointing the urgency of early detection. In this chapter the introduction is briefly described in Section 30.1. The fundamental of nanosensors is explained in Section 30.2. The significance and applications of nanosensors in virus detection are extensively discussed in Sections 30.3 and 30.4. Section 30.5 consists of various challenges and outlook.","Saylan, Yeşeren; Denizli, Adil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-819870-4.00038-4,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
270,"Chapter 16 Combustion, reactive hazard, and bioprocess safety","Abstract Is bioprocess dangerous? How to maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories—physical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of “significant amount” of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway. As a bioprocess engineer, you will be responsible for creating safe processes and protecting the lives and health of your colleagues.","Liu, Shijie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-12-821012-3.00016-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

274,Chapter 162 Transverse Myelitis,"Abstract Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammatory condition across the spinal cord, along one or more levels and in the absence of compression. Idiopathic acute TM is rare and with improvements in diagnostic tools and longer follow-up, the etiology which may include post-infectious, multiple sclerosis, or neuromyelitis optica often becomes clearer. The patient may present acutely with weakness, sensory impairments, or bowel and bladder changes. A careful history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic studies including blood tests and an MRI scan may help determine the diagnosis and etiology. Following the acute management, which may include use of steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and plasma exchange, a comprehensive medical rehabilitation program is important to optimize recovery from the resultant impairments and disabilities and manage associated complications. Complications such as paralysis, autonomic dysfunction, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain, spasticity, contractures, neurogenic bladder and bowels, skin breakdown, and psychological issues will benefit from the expertise of the physiatrist. Rehabilitation will include functional restoration with therapy as well as compensation of residual impairment with mobility and various other assistive devices.","Lim, Peter A.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-54947-9.00162-0,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-54947-9.00162-0,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-54947-9.00162-0,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
275,1 Tropical Lung Diseases,"Abstract Lung disease is common in the tropics; lower respiratory tract infections are a major cause of mortality, especially in children under 5 years of age. The World Health Organization has launched strategies to tackle this killer of children. Infections, including tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis, find vulnerable hosts in the tropics where human immunodeficiency virus co-infection is widespread, especially in India and sub-Saharan Africa. Parasitic infections can cause pulmonary manifestations (e.g., pleural effusion and cavitary lesions). Blood and pulmonary eosinophilia are common in such infections. Non-communicable lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer associated with tobacco use, contribute to mortality, particularly where there is poor access to health structures.","Papanikolaou, Ilias C.; Tsenempi, Xenia A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00001-6,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
276,20 Infection Prevention and Control in the Tropics,"Abstract Tropical settings present unique challenges to the practice of infection prevention and control. These are multi-faceted due to differences in the climate, culture, social, and political milieu of low- and middle-income countries situated in the tropics, as well as the lack of resources. The emergence of communicable diseases and low vaccination coverage also lead to nosocomial augmentation of community outbreaks, further increasing the economic burden of hospital management. Addressing these challenges requires innovative, low-cost, and tailored solutions suited to the tropical environment.","Shakoor, Sadia; Warraich, Haider J.; Zaidi, Anita K.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00020-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
277,21 Microbiology,"Abstract The management and containment of many treatable and preventable infectious diseases in resource-poor countries is limited by the failure to make an accurate diagnosis. Most of the world's population lacks access to accurate, affordable, easy-to-use, quality-assured, reliable, and accessible diagnostic tests and misdiagnosis of infectious diseases is common and compromises patient care. Laboratory diagnostics are also needed for the detection and surveillance of the increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Accurate clinical diagnosis in resource-poor settings relies strongly on the laboratory service, and the need to support the development of a quality-assured laboratory service in such settings is increasingly recognized. International organizations are actively working with local and national providers to improve laboratory services. The development of laboratory services will contribute to improved health for the local population, protection against emerging pathogens, and ensure better use of scarce health care resources.","Parry, Christopher M.; Peacock, Sharon J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00021-1,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
278,33 Viral Respiratory Infections,"Abstract Acute respiratory illnesses are the most frequently occurring illness in all age groups globally. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral respiratory tract infection.","van Doorn, H.

279,36 Viral Febrile Illnesses and Emerging Pathogens,"Abstract Emerging or emerged diseases and viral pathogens are responsible historically and currently for large epidemics, global pandemics, and significant morbidity and mortality. Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.","Endy, Timothy P.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00036-3,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
280,40 Group A Streptococcus,"Abstract Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes, affects an estimated 800 million people each year. Most of the resulting estimated 639,000 annual deaths are related to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and its complications. Resource-limited areas account for the vast majority of cases, although outbreaks still occur in industrialized countries. GAS has several mechanisms to avoid phagocytosis, including prevention of opsonization and the use of surface proteins to block complement fixation. The mechanisms behind the immunologic phenomenon are not well understood. Clinical presentations range from benign, short-lived impetigo or pharyngitis through to lifelong RHD. In its most invasive form, GAS can cause a rapidly progressive, often lethal infection: streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. S. pyogenes remains universally sensitive to penicillin, which is the mainstay of treatment.","Hand, Robert M.; Snelling, Thomas L.; Carapetis, Jonathan R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00040-5,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
281,140 Bats,"Abstract The 1100 species of bats constitute 20% of all mammalian species, distributed in all continents except Antarctica. The only mammals capable of self-powered flying, many can catch insects in complete darkness, using sophisticated echolocation. They are ecologically important in controlling insects, pollinating fruit trees, distributing seeds, and are widely eaten. Many viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites have been isolated from bats. In some cases, direct bat-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Lyssavirus infections transmissible to humans by bats include classic rabies, Duvenhage, European bat lyssaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus. Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) transmit classic rabies to humans and domestic animals in Latin America. Insectivorous and frugivorous bats are vectors or reservoirs of at least five Lyssaviruses species, Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), Henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), and some other viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Bat-transmitted rabies infections can be prevented by vaccination. Vampire bat rabies can be controlled by vaccinating the bats or killing them with anti-coagulants.","Warrell, David A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00140-x,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
282,150 Fever in the Returned Traveler,"Abstract International travel is associated with a risk of infections not typically seen in high-income settings. Malaria is the most important tropical infection in travelers, but epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika emphasize that clinicians need to be aware of the rapidly changing distribution of many arboviruses. A detailed travel history and a syndromic approach to the investigation and management of patients is key. Consultation with a specialist is often recommended to ensure that appropriate management and investigations are undertaken in febrile returned travelers.","Marks, Michael; Johnston, Victoria; Brown, Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00150-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00150-2,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-55512-8.00150-2,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
283,Chapter 5 Common Myths and Legends of Rabies,"Abstract Humankind has somewhat of a dark, yet almost fascinating, supernatural relationship with rabies. Even after Pasteur's rabies vaccine discovery, globally people continue to be stricken with it today. History has carried along the myths and legends that surround this diabolical virus. Some still believe that rabies treatment requires 20 or more shots to the stomach by some monstrously long needle. However, today's treatment regimen is typically only four vaccinations (five for immunocompromised) in the arm, plus human rabies immune globulin.

284,15 What factors predispose patients to acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"Abstract: Sepsis, pneumonia, and shock are the most common conditions predisposing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and certain host genetic variants have been associated with the development of ARDS. Risk modifiers include abuse of alcohol and tobacco, malnutrition, and obesity. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the simplified Early Acute Lung Injury Score predict ARDS based on clinical and investigational criteria. Hospital-acquired ARDS may result from a medley factors of which high tidal volume ventilation, high oxygen concentration, and plasma transfusion are most commonly implicated. The Checklist for Lung Injury Prevention (CLIP) has been developed to ensure compliance with evidence-based practice that may affect ARDS occurrence. To date, no pharmacologic intervention has been shown to prevent ARDS","Odeyemi, Yewande; Moraes, Alice Gallo De; Gajic, Ognjen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00024-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00024-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00024-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
285,46 How can biomarkers be used to differentiate between infection and non-infectious causes of inflammation?,"Abstract: Diagnosis of sepsis is based on recognition of systemic inflammation and organ failure in the context of an inciting infection. Since none of the diagnostic criteria are specific to sepsis, it is easy to confound sepsis with noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism amongst others. Two widely used biomarkers, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have proven promising in sepsis diagnosis. Each has found varying success in the clinical context, with some centers relying heavily on these markers and others eschewing their use almost entirely. In this chapter, we present the evidence for their use in the diagnosis of sepsis and management of antibiotic therapy in the intensive care unit context.","Binnie, Alexandra; Lage, Joel; Dos Santos, Claudia C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,Elsevier,10.1016/b978-0-323-64068-8.00055-9,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
286,Chapter 16 Passive Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibody Therapies,"Abstract Passive antibody therapies have a long history of use. In the 19th century, antibodies from xenographic sources of polyclonal antibodies were used to treat infections (diphtheria). They were used often as protection from infectious agents and toxins. Complications related to their use involved development of immune complexes and severe allergic reactions. As a result, human source plasma for polyclonal antibodies became the preferential source for antibodies. They are used to treat infection, remove toxins, prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn, modify inflammatory reactions, and control autoimmune diseases. Continued improvements in processing decreased the transfusion/infusion transmission of infections. In the late 20th century (∼1986), monoclonal antibodies were developed. The first monoclonal antibodies were of xenographic source and were wrought with problems of immunogenicity. These forms of antibodies did not gain favor until chimerization took pace in the mid-1990s and in 1998 two monoclonal antibodies were approved one to treat respiratory syncytial virus and the other for breast cancers. Further development of humanized and then fully human monoclonal antibodies has led to an evolution of therapies with these agents. Monoclonal antibodies are being researched or approved to treat a multitude of diseases to include oncologic, inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, allergic, benign hematologic, infections, orthopedic, coagulopathy, metabolic and to decrease morbidity of disease (diminution of pain), modify disease progression, and potentially anatomic development. In this chapter, we will review the history of use of these passive antibody therapies, their mechanism of action, pharmacologic-therapeutic classification, particular medical indication, adverse reactions, and potential future use of these medications.","Pelletier, J.

290,Confidence in managing human monkeypox cases in Asia: A cross-sectional survey among general practitioners in Indonesia,"Abstract The current re-emergence of human monkeypox (HMPX) is a global concern for endemic and non-endemic countries, but healthcare workers in some regions, like Asia, have less experience with identifying and treating HMPX cases. This study aimed to assess the confidence and its predictors in HMPX case management among general practitioners (GPs), the frontline doctors in Indonesia, and to explore their perspectives on HMPX. Between May and July 2019, GPs in Indonesia completed an online-based survey. The questionnaire collected information on GPs’ confidence, perspective, sociodemographic, workplace and professional characteristics, exposure to HMPX information and knowledge on HMPX. A logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the explanatory variables influencing the confidence and the perspective. We included 395 GPs in our analysis (77.4% out of 510 responses received) of which 10.1% and 34.9% were classified having good confidence using an 80% and 70% cut-off for confidence score, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, receiving information about HMPX during medical training was the only variable significantly associated with good confidence (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 4.78 and p < 0.001). Approximately 73.6% and 77.9% of GPs agreed that HMPX is an important infectious disease and it has potential to detrimentally impact the Indonesian economy, respectively. In addition, 88.8% of GPs suggested that the disease should be incorporated into the National Medical Curriculum of Indonesia. In conclusion, in case of HMPX outbreak, majority of the GPs in Indonesia seem to be less confident in diagnosing and treating cases, using their current knowledge, skills and their workplace facilities. Therefore, a systematic strategy to improve their confidence in managing HMPX is required.","Harapan, Harapan; Setiawan, Abdul M.; Yufika, Amanda; Anwar, Samsul; Wahyuni, Sri; Asrizal, Febrivan W.; Sufri, Muhammad R.; Putra, Reza P.; Wijayanti, Nanda P.; Salwiyadi, Salwiyadi; Maulana, Razi; Khusna, Afriyani; Nusrina, Ina; Shidiq, Muhammad; Fitriani, Devi; Muharrir, Muharrir; Husna, Cut A.; Yusri, Fitria; Maulana, Reza; Utomo, Prattama S.; Andalas, Mohd; Wagner, Abram L.; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,Elsevier,10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105450,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

296,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy,"Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 – 2.5, indicating that 2 – 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.","Dashraath, Pradip; Jing Lin Jeslyn, Wong; Mei Xian Karen, Lim; Li Min, Lim; Sarah, Li; Biswas, Arijit; Arjandas Choolani, Mahesh; Mattar, Citra; Lin, Su Lin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.03.021,23/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-23

302,Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses,"Abstract The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.044,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19
303,Spike protein recognition of mammalian ACE2 predicts the host range and an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 causes the recent global COVID-19 public health emergency. ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To predict the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the key residues of ACE2 for recognizing S protein. We found that most of the selected mammals including pets (dog and cat), pangolin and Circetidae mammals remained the most of key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interface between cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S protein was simulated through homology modeling. We identified that N82 in ACE2 showed a closer contact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than M82 in human ACE2. Our finding will provide important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and a new strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Luan, Junwen; Lu, Yue; Jin, Xiaolu; Zhang, Leiliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19
304,EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 inhibits ACE2 expression,"Abstract The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading globally and quickly, leading to emerging health issues. SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2. Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2. In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3. ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout. Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells. This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues. Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.","Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Honggang; Zhou, Liquan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.010,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. Methods Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. Results Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7–99.4]; P<0.01). Conclusions Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections. Level 3 PPE appears to reduce the risk of transmission to anaesthetists who are exposed to mildly symptomatic surgical patients.","Zhong, Qi; Liu, Yin Y.; Luo, Qiong; Zou, Yu F.; Jiang, Hai X.; Li, Hui; Zhang, Jing J.; Li, Zhen; Yang, Xin; Ma, Min; Tang, Li J.; Chen, Ying Y.; Zheng, Feng; Ke, Jian J.; Zhang, Zong Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.007,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
309,Anaesthesia and COVID-19: infection control,"Summary The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.","Odor, Peter M.; Neun, Maximilian; Bampoe, Sohail; Clark, Sam; Heaton, Daniel; Hoogenboom, Emilie M.; Brown, Michael; Patel, Anil; Kamming, Damon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

En el presente documento se explican las principales medidas a tener en cuenta en caso de atención a pacientes COVID-19 o sospecha tanto durante su evaluación como en caso de requerir tratamiento quirúrgico. Abstract Due to the current pandemic of respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection will require elective surgery, surgery that cannot be postponed, or emergency surgical treatment. In these situations, special measures need to be adopted in order to minimize the possibility of transmission between patients, exposure of healthcare personnel and the development of postoperative complications. This document explains the main principles to consider when managing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients during evaluation as well as when surgical treatment is required.","Balibrea, Jose Mose.; Badia, Josep Mose.; Rubio Pérez, Inés; Martín Antona, Esteban; Álvarez Peña, Estíbaliz; García Botella, Sandra; Álvarez Gallego, Mario; Martín Pérez, Elena; Martínez Cortijo, Sagrario; Pascual Miguelañez, Isabel; Pérez Díaz, Lola; Ramos Rodriguez, Jose Luis; Espin Basany, Eloy; Sánchez Santos, Raquel; Soria Aledo, Victoriano; López Barrachina, Ruth; Morales-Conde, Salvador",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.03.001,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

Los tres pacientes fallecieron por insuficiencia respiratoria, su edad media era de 81 años. Cirujanos: Hubo un total de 12 casos SARS-CoV-2 + confirmados (24,4%) (8 de 34 adjuntos y 4 de 15 residentes). Actividad asistencial: El número medio de intervenciones quirúrgicas urgentes diarias bajó de 3,6 en febrero a 1,16 en el mes de marzo. El 42% de los pacientes intervenidos a partir de la entrada en vigor de las primeras medidas de aislamiento a nivel regional, presentaban cuadros evolucionados. Conclusiones: El aumento de casos en la población general de COVID-19 debe alertar a los Servicios de Cirugía General de la necesidad de tomar de medidas de forma precoz que garanticen la seguridad de los pacientes y de los cirujanos. Abstract Introduction: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a radical reorganization of healthcare resources. Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. Patients and methods: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. Results: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","Álvarez Gallego, M; Gortázar de las Casas, S; Pascual Migueláñez, I; Rubio-Pérez, I; Barragán Serrano, C; Álvarez Peña, E; Díaz Domínguez, J",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

319,Thrombocytopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Methods An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD −31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from −35 to −29 × 109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, −48 × 109/L; 95% CI, −57 to −39 × 109/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8–14.6). Conclusions Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Henry, Brandon Michael",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

In this case, negative results of RT-PCR testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected COVID-19 patient, clinical signs and symptoms, other laboratory findings, and chest CT images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence. This case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.","Lv, Ding-feng; Ying, Qi-ming; Weng, Yue-song; Shen, Chi-bin; Chu, Jin-guo; Kong, Jing-ping; Sun, Ding-he; Gao, Xiang; Weng, Xing-bei; Chen, Xue-qin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.032,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31
322,The characteristics and clinical value of chest CT images of novel coronavirus pneumonia,"AIM To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity. RESULTS The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow. CONCLUSION The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.","Zhao, X.; Liu, B.; Yu, Y.; Wang, X.; Du, Y.; Gu, J.; Wu, X.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.002,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

324,CT characteristics of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus: association with clinical type,"Abstract Aim To summarise the features of chest computed tomography (CT) of a series of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) to speed up recognition and have a better understanding of COVID-19 disease. Materials And Methods The clinical information and chest CT images of 93 patients infected with 2019-nCov from multiple centres were reviewed. Results Of the 93 cases, abnormalities in 91 cases were located at the subpleural level, presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO; n=69, 74.2%) and consolidation (n=56, 60.2%) in multiple lobes. Other CT features included vascular dilatation (n=83, 89.2%), interlobular septal thickening (n=29, 31.2%), bronchodilatation (n=44, 47.3%), the crazy-paving sign (n=34, 36.6%), the sieve-hole sign (n=12, 12.9%), pleural thickening (n=21, 22.6%), and pleural effusion (n=8, 8.6%). Multiple lobe involvement, including the presence of consolidation, the crazy-paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, pleural thickening and pleural effusion, was more common in critical patients with heavy/critical infection (p<0.05), whereas the presence of GGO, involvement of one or two lobes, and the halo sign were more common in patients with mild/common-type infections (p<0.05). Moreover, older age, higher body temperature, complaints of chest tightness and breathlessness, and lymphopenia was associated with heavy/critical infections. Conclusion The CT and clinical appearances of COVID-19 are variable and reflect the severity of COVID-19 to some extent.","Wang, J.; Xu, Z.; Wang, J.; Feng, R.; An, Y.; Ao, W.; Gao, Y.; Wang, X.; Xie, Z.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.crad.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

326,Comparison of Hospitalized Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1,"Abstract Background Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019, considerable attention has been focused on its elucidation. However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. Research question The aim of the study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study Design and Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study. We compared two independent cohorts of ARDS patients infected with either COVID-19 (n=73) or H1N1 (n=75). We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis. Results The median age of COVID-19 patients was higher than that of H1N1 patients, and there was a higher proportion of males among COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). COVID-19 patients exhibited higher proportions of non-productive coughs, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms than those of H1N1 patients (p<0.05). H1N1 patients had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores than COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). The PaO2/FiO2 of 198.2 mmHg in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the PaO2/FiO2 of 107.0 mmHg of H1N1 patients (p<0.001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in COVID-19 patients than in H1N1 patients (p<0.001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was 28.8%, while that of H1N1 patients was 34.7% (p=0.483). SOFA-score adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients with the rate ratio was 2.009 (95% CI [1.563, 2.583], p<0.001). Interpretation There were many differences between COVID-19 and H1N1-induced ARDS patients in clinical presentations. Compared with H1N1, patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA-score adjusted mortality.","Tang, Xiao; Du, Ronghui; Wang, Rui; Cao, Tanze; Guan, Lulu; Yang, Chengqing; Zhu, Qi; Hu, Ming; Li, Xuyan; Li, Ying; Liang, Lirong; Tong, Zhaohui; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huanzhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.032,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26

330,The Role of Chest Imaging in Patient Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multinational Consensus Statement from the Fleischner Society,"Abstract With more than 900,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50,000 deaths during the first three months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented healthcare crisis. The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.","Rubin, Geoffrey D.; Ryerson, Christopher J.; Haramati, Linda B.; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W.; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B.K.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Kong, Christina; Altes, Talissa; Bush, Andrew; Desai, Sujal R.; Goldin, Jonathan; Goo, Jin Mo; Humbert, Marc; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Luo, Fengming; Mazzone, Peter J.; Prokop, Mathias; Remy-Jardin, Martine; Richeldi, Luca; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M.; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Wells, Athol U.; Leung, Ann N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
331,Assurer les soins aux patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l’épidémie à SARS-CoV-2,"Résumé Objectif: L’absence de préparation du système de soins psychiatriques à l’épidémie de virus SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un scénario pessimiste pour la santé physique et mentale des patients suivis en psychiatrie. L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie COVID-19. Méthode: Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats: Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement, et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité COVID+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion: Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Abstract Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

335,"COVID-19, una emergencia de salud pública mundial","Resumen Un nuevo brote de coronavirus surgió el pasado 31 de diciembre de 2019 en Wuhan, China, causando conmoción entre la comunidad médica y el resto del mundo. Esta nueva especie de coronavirus fue denominada como 2019-nCoV, causante de un gran número de casos y fallecimientos en China y en cantidad creciente fuera de ella, convirtiéndose en una emergencia de salud pública a nivel mundial. 2019-nCoV es un virus con alta homología con otros coronavirus patogénicos, como los originados por zoonosis con murciélagos (SARS-CoV) causantes de aproximadamente 646 muertes en China a principios de la década. Su tasa de mortalidad no es tan elevada (aproximadamente del 2-3%), pero su rápida propagación ha propiciado la activación de protocolos para detener su diseminación. Este patógeno tiene el potencial para convertirse en pandemia, por lo que es vital seguir las recomendaciones de cuidado personal dictadas por la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Abstract A new coronavirus outbreak emerged on the 31st of December 2019 in Wuhan, China, causing commotion among the medical community and the rest of the world. This new species of coronavirus has been termed 2019-nCoV and has caused a considerable number of cases of infection and deaths in China and, to a growing degree, beyond China, becoming a worldwide public health emergency. 2019-nCoV has high homology to other pathogenic coronaviruses, such as those originating from bat-related zoonosis (SARS-CoV), which caused approximately 646 deaths in China at the start of the decade. The mortality rate for 2019-nCoV is not as high (approximately 2-3%), but its rapid propagation has resulted in the activation of protocols to stop its spread. This pathogen has the potential to become a pandemic. It is therefore vital to follow the personal care recommendations issued by the World Health Organisation.","Palacios Cruz, M.; Santos, E.; Velázquez Cervantes, M.A.; León Juárez, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rce.2020.03.001,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

351,Teaching-practice as a critical bridge for narrowing the research-practice gap,"Abstract Management researchers and management practitioners increasingly appear to be talking past each other. A solution lies in understanding that interactive management education has an important role to play in bridging this divide, but for some reason this mode of academic exchange is often forgotten. Our paper broadens the stakeholder value perspective to explore how and why the interests of researchers and practitioners have diverged, before going on to present illustrative cases of programs attempting to bridge such differences. Current conditions suggest that the dissonance between different cycle-times of research and practice is not sustainable with the inevitable outcome of a shrinking commons. Generating new knowledge and propagating it rapidly through education and teaching-practice is an important way of disseminating higher-order research and findings. In a world where academic relevance is under threat, enabling academics to better cross such a divide is critical. Marketing-management researchers and teachers ironically have their own challenge of taking what can be a complex theory (the marketing academic equivalent of a “sausage”) and making it “sizzle”.","Kriz, Anton; Nailer, Christopher; Jansen, Karen; Potocnjak-Oxman, Camilo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.017,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

353,Effects of colostrum instead of formula feeding for the first 2 days postnatum on whole-body energy metabolism and its endocrine control in neonatal calves,"ABSTRACT Colostrum provides high amounts of nutritive and non-nutritive substrates, which are essential for calf nutrition and passive immunization. Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","Liermann, W.; Schäff, C.T.; Gruse, J.; Derno, M.; Weitzel, J.M.; Kanitz, E.; Otten, W.; Hoeflich, A.; Stefaniak, T.; Sauerwein, H.; Bruckmaier, R.M.; Gross, J.J.; Hammon, H.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17708,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17708,Elsevier,10.3168/jds.2019-17708,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

The stoichiometry of all the metal complexes is found to be 1: 2 (M: L2) with the general formula, [M(L)2], where L is a singly deprotonated ligand and the geometry of all the metal complexes is found to be octahedral. Ligands and their metal complexes successfully cleaved the pBR322 plasmid DNA and in case of anticancer activity against MCF–7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cell line, the synthesized compounds found to exhibit excellent activity with prominent apoptotic effect which is characterized by cell shrinkage, cell breakage and turgidity and results were compared with the standard drug cisplatin. Very significant anticancer activity was observed for compounds L1H, Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2)2, Ni(L1)2 and Ni(L2)2 with IC50 value of <10 μgmL−1. Molecular docking studies were performed to assess the bonding mode of synthesized compounds. In case of antioxidant activity study, the compounds L1H, Ni(L1)2, Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2)2 and Ni(L2)2 exhibited significant scavenging activity with good percentage when compared with remaining tested compounds.","Kumbar, Mahantesh; Patil, Sangamesh A.; Toragalmath, Shivakumar S.; Kinnal, Shivashankar M.; Shettar, Arun; Hosakeri, Joy H.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2020.121219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jorganchem.2020.121219,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jorganchem.2020.121219,07/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-07

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.","Elfiky, Abdo A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,Elsevier,10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117592,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25
363,Urgent Guidance for Navigating and Circumventing the QTc-Prolonging and Torsadogenic Potential of Possible Pharmacotherapies for Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19),"Abstract As the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) global pandemic rages across the globe, the race to prevent and treat this deadly disease has led to the “off-label” repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, which has the potential for unwanted QT-interval prolongation and a risk of drug-induced sudden cardiac death. With the possibility that a considerable proportion of the world’s population soon could receive COVID-19 pharmacotherapies with torsadogenic potential for therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, this document serves to help health care professionals mitigate the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias while minimizing risk of COVID-19 exposure to personnel and conserving the limited supply of personal protective equipment.","Giudicessi, John R.; Noseworthy, Peter A.; Friedman, Paul A.; Ackerman, Michael J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.024,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
364,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Antihypertensives (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) in Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being defined as the worst pandemic disease of modern times. Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.","Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lavie, Carl J.; Perez-Quilis, Carme; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

370,The Race to Zero?: China's Poaching of Taiwan's Diplomatic Allies,"Abstract The election of Tsai Ing-wen as President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 2016 reignited Beijing's quest to poach Taiwan's diplomatic allies. Between her election in January 2016 and reelection in January 2020, Taiwan has lost seven countries to China. After eight years of a “diplomatic truce” under President Ma Ying-jeou, China re-started its multi-pronged strategy to pressure Taiwan into eventual unification, and one of the key tactics is to poach all of Taiwan's now-15 remaining diplomatic allies to eliminate its international legitimacy. This article seeks to explain what, if any, benefits formal diplomatic relations provide Taiwan and the ways in which Beijing induces countries to switch ties. It concludes by providing recommendations for what actions the United States can undertake to slow the impending completion of the “race to zero.”","Shattuck, Thomas J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.003,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04
371,"Foreign Policy through Other Means: Hard Power, Soft Power, and China's Turn to Political Warfare to Influence the United States","Abstract The People's Republic of China increasingly has turned to political warfare and sharp power to influence U.S. policy toward China and on international issues that it considers important. This turn in part reflects the limited effectiveness of Beijing's much-increased hard power and its never-formidable and now-reduced soft power as means to achieve China's ends with the United States. China's political warfare and uses of sharp power pursue both direct influence on U.S. policy and indirect impact through affecting American attitudes toward China and China-related issues. China's efforts range across many sectors—including business, culture, media, education, and more—and they have prompted reactions and countermeasures. In China's view, the United States has long been engaged in something like political warfare or sharp power undertakings targeting China. If, or as, U.S.-China relations continue to become more adversarial, political warfare, uses of sharp power, and measures to counter them are likely to increase.","deLisle, Jacques",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.004,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04

373,Molecular and pathogenicity of infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus) in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica),"Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection is highly infectious respiratory disease in poultry industry with significant economic importance. The prevalence of IBV in quail industry in Malaysia was not well documented; therefore, its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown. This study was to determine the susceptibility of Japanese quail, as one of the species in commercial poultry industry, toward IBV. In addition, it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental study on IBV inoculation in quail. In this experimental study, 20 quails were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 for group A, B, and C, n = 5 for control group). The quails in group A, B, and C were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 mL of 10 × 5 EID50 of the virus. Clinical signs, gross lesions, positive detection of virus, and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these Japanese quails. The results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds. Trachea, lung, and kidney were subjected to one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection. The virus was found from trachea and lung samples, whereas it was absent from all kidney samples. Only 3 quails were found with gross lesions. There was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 ± 0.845 (P < 0.05) within the treatment groups. In summary, Japanese quails might be susceptible to IBV.","Fadhilah, A.S.; Kai, T.H.; Lokman, H.I.; Yasmin, N.A.R.; Hafandi, A.; Hasliza, A.H.; Tengku Rinalfi, T.A.; Hezmee, M.N.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psj.2020.01.026,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
374,"Effect of essential oils on the immune response to some viral vaccines in broiler chickens, with special reference to Newcastle disease virus","Abstract This trial assessed the efficacy of a commercial essential oils (Eos) product on the immune response to vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) and subsequent challenge with virulent ND virus genotype VII (vNDv genotype VII) by using the following experimental groups of broiler chickens (each group had 21 birds with three replicates in each, n=seven): NC (negative control), PC (positive control), VC (vaccinated), and VTC (vaccinated and treated with EOs). Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preventive or therapeutic measure, two additional ND-vaccinated groups were used (PRV: medicated one day before vNDv challenge for 5 days; and TTT: medicated two days post vNDv challenge for 5 days). In addition, the immune-modulatory effect of EOs on the avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC) revealed lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs and post mortem lesion score (11) comparing to ND vaccines alone (VC) (52.28% mortality and score 15), in addition to lower hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (p<0.05) (6.5±0.46) and viral shedding (10 log 2.28±0.24) titres one week post challenge in comparison with of VC (8.63±0.65 and 10 log 3.29±0.72, respectively). Nevertheless, the EOs mixture (VTC) (1952±28.82) did not significantly (p>0.05) improve growth performance compared to the non-treated birds (NC and VC) (1970±19.56 and 1904±38.66). Essential oils showed an antiviral effect on vNDv in vivo (in chickens) as a preventive measure (PRV) as well as some therapeutic effect (TTT) through decreasing the viral shedding titres (loNC0), mortality rate, and severity of clinical signs and post mortem lesions, in addition to serum malondialdhyde (MDA) level. Regarding the other viruses, the EOs mixture did not improve the immune response to the AI and IB vaccines but significantly (p<0.05) increased the ELISA antibody titre for IBD virus at 28th day of age (2108±341.05). The studied EOs mixture showed an immune stimulating response to ND and IBD vaccines, antiviral effect against ND virus especially if administered before the challenge, however it did not have a growth promoting effect.","El-Shall, Nahed A.; Shewita, Ramadan S.; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E.; AlKahtane, Abdullah; Alarifi, Saud; Alkahtani, Saad; Abdel-Daim, Mohamed M.; Sedeik, Mahmoud E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psj.2020.03.008,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

379,How to improve adherence with quarantine: Rapid review of the evidence,"Abstract Objectives The January 2020 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to ‘self-isolate’ if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design Rapid evidence review. Methods We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","Webster, Rebecca K.; Brooks, Samantha K.; Smith, Louise E.; Woodland, Lisa; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, G.

On January 20, 2020, Chinese expert group confirmed that the spread of the virus is characterized by human-to-human transmission. Study Design It is difficult for the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by only wearing masks, and the most important measureto take is to cut off the route of transmission; otherwise, there is noway to control the disease. Methods The Wuhan Municipal Governmentannounced the control of the migration of the population in Wuhan, and population migration in Hubei Province also continues to be monitored after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission.Unfortunately, some problems remain. Results At the beginning of the epidemic breakout, there were not enough hospital beds for the patients in Wuhan, and a large number of patients were required to self-solate at home. Therefore, home isolation poses significant risks. Conclusions The patient will transmit the virus to other people in the houseif a patient has been confirmed to have the virus and is under home isolation.This can lead to the infection of the patient's entire family.","Feng, Zhan-hui; Cheng, Yong-ran; Ye, Lan; Zhou, Meng-Yun; Wang, Ming-Wei; Chen, Juan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.008,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

387,New insights into the evolutionary features of viral overlapping genes by discriminant analysis,"Abstract Overlapping genes originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing frame induce the expression of a de novo protein from an alternative frame. In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Pavesi, Angelo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virol.2020.03.007,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

390,Association between ambient temperature and COVID-19 infection in 122 cities from China,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health problem globally. Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. Methods Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. Results The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3 °C and became flat above 3 °C. When mean temperature (lag0–14) was below 3 °C, each 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209–6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 °C. There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline when the weather becomes warmer, which provides useful implications for policymakers and the public.","Zhu, Yongjian; Xie, Jingui",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138201,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
391,"Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Abstract Meteorological parameters are the important factors influencing the infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. This study aims to explore the association between Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths and weather parameters. In this study, we collected the daily death numbers of COVID-19, meteorological parameters and air pollutant data from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan, China. Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [−7.50% (95% CI: −10.99%, −3.88%) and −11.41% (95% CI: −19.68%, −2.29%)].

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.","Vellingiri, Balachandar; Jayaramayya, Kaavya; Iyer, Mahalaxmi; Narayanasamy, Arul; Govindasamy, Vivekanandhan; Giridharan, Bupesh; Ganesan, Singaravelu; Venugopal, Anila; Venkatesan, Dhivya; Ganesan, Harsha; Rajagopalan, Kamarajan; Rahman, Pattanathu K.S.M.; Cho, Ssang-Goo; Kumar, Nachimuthu Senthil; Subramaniam, Mohana Devi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
393,Real-time estimation and prediction of mortality caused by COVID-19 with patient information based algorithm,"Abstract The global COVID-19 outbreak is worrisome both for its high rate of spread, and the high case fatality rate reported by early studies and now in Italy. We report a new methodology, the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation (SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on known information of early patients in different countries.","Wang, Lishi; Li, Jing; Guo, Sumin; Xie, Ning; Yao, Lan; Cao, Yanhong; Day, Sara W.; Howard, Scott C.; Graff, J.

This study employed a secondary data analysis of surveillance data of covid-19 from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia and weather from the Meteorological Department of the Republic of Indonesia. The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Spearman-rank correlation test was used for data analysis. Among the components of the weather, only temperature average (°C) was significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic (r = 0.392; p < .01).

395,Kidney disease is associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19,"Abstract In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide. Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+∼3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+∼3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","Cheng, Yichun; Luo, Ran; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Zhixiang; Dong, Lei; Li, Junhua; Yao, Ying; Ge, Shuwang; Xu, Gang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.005,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

400,Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sulfolipid-1 Activates Nociceptive Neurons and Induces Cough,"Summary Pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifests with a persistent cough as both a primary symptom and mechanism of transmission. The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid.","Ruhl, Cody R.; Pasko, Breanna L.; Khan, Haaris S.; Kindt, Lexy M.; Stamm, Chelsea E.; Franco, Luis H.; Hsia, Connie C.; Zhou, Min; Davis, Colton R.; Qin, Tian; Gautron, Laurent; Burton, Michael D.; Mejia, Galo L.; Naik, Dhananjay K.; Dussor, Gregory; Price, Theodore J.; Shiloh, Michael U.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.026,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
401,CRISPR in livestock: From editing to printing,"Abstract Precise genome editing of large animals applied to livestock and biomedicine is nowadays possible since the CRISPR revolution. This review summarizes the latest advances and the main technical issues that determine the success of this technology. The pathway from editing to printing, from engineering the genome to achieving the desired animals, does not always imply an easy, fast and safe journey. When applied in large animals, CRISPR involves time- and cost-consuming projects, and it is mandatory not only to choose the best approach for genome editing, but also for embryo production, zygote microinjection or electroporation, cryopreservation and embryo transfer. The main technical refinements and most frequent questions to improve this disruptive biotechnology in large animals are presented. In addition, we discuss some CRISPR applications to enhance livestock production in the context of a growing global demand of food, in terms of increasing efficiency, reducing the impact of farming on the environment, enhancing pest control, animal welfare and health. The challenge is no longer technical. Controversies and consensus, opportunities and threats, benefits and risks, ethics and science should be reconsidered to enter into the CRISPR era.","Menchaca, A.; dos Santos-Neto, P.C.; Mulet, A.P.; Crispo, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.01.063,29/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-29
402,Small Animal Reproduction: scientific facts versus dogmas or unverified beliefs.,"Abstract Small Animal Reproduction is a rather recent topic in the field of Animal Reproduction. Although some continuing educational societies aim to improve the level of general knowledge, published scientific facts are still rare, and there are many hypotheses or affirmations that remain unverified or even sometimes dogmatic or empirical. Taking some examples, this article reviews the main causes that may sometimes create difficulties for a veterinary practitioner faced with a dog or a cat suffering from reproductive problems. It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific certainty or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verified, unverified affirmations, unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity. The growing interest for research in Small Animal Reproduction will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.","Fontbonne, Alain",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.03.014,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

405,Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19): Implications for Clinical Dental Care,"Abstract The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease has gripped the entire international community and has caused widespread public health concerns. Despite global efforts to contain the disease spread, the outbreak is still on a rise because of the community spread pattern of this infection. This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature. Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection. In addition, specific recommendations for dental practice are suggested for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.","Ather, Amber; Patel, Biraj; Ruparel, Nikita B.; Diogenes, Anibal; Hargreaves, Kenneth M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.joen.2020.03.008,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

408,Cuidado Respiratorio En Covid-19,"Abstract Background: COVID-19 is part of the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae. The new pathogen β-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus was initially named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), identified in a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Patients developed alterations in the respiratory system leading to severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Objective: To review the available scientific evidence related to the care of the respiratory system in order to establish general treatment guidelines. Methods: Narrative review of the literature was carried out that included a search, selection, and review of original and secondary articles written in English or Spanish in the different databases: NCBI, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE published up to March 2020. Results: No specific treatment for the new disease has been defined, with symptomatic control as the main therapeutic measure. The use of biosecurity elements, such as goggles, hats, gloves, long waterproof aprons, high efficiency masks for healthcare personnel (FFP2 or N95) is recommended. In symptomatic patients use surgical masks, hospital soap, paper towels, and 70% alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. Use oxygen through low flow systems. A mechanical ventilation program in VCP or VCV modes, Vt: 4-6 ml/Kg, Fr: ≤ 35, FiO2: for PaO2 = 60 mmHg or SpO2: 92-96%, PEEP: 12-17 cmH2O, Prone ventilation if PAFI ≤ 150 with ratio16/8 or 18/6, nitric oxide: 5-20 ppm. Conclusions: Use biosecurity equipment in order to prevent transmission. In hypoxaemia use low flow oxygen therapy systems. Use lung protection strategies, decrease in tidal volumes, plateau pressures and respiratory rates, plus implementation of high PEEP values, low conduction pressure values ​​and prone ventilation. These have been shown to improve hypoxaemia and survival in patients with ARDS.","Chica-Meza, Carmen; Peña-López, Luis Alexander; Villamarín-Guerrero, Héctor Fabio; Moreno-Collazos, Jorge Enrique; Rodríguez-Corredor, Lizeth Catherine; Lozano, Wilson Mauricio; Vargas-Ordoñez, Mónica Patricia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acci.2020.04.001,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

410,Health security capacities in the context of COVID-19 outbreak: an analysis of International Health Regulations annual report data from 182 countries,"Summary Background Public health measures to prevent, detect, and respond to events are essential to control public health risks, including infectious disease outbreaks, as highlighted in the International Health Regulations (IHR). In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. Methods We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). Findings Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). Interpretation Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

413,COVID-19 and Italy: what next?,"Summary The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend.

They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement). Fangcang shelter hospitals could be powerful components of national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as future epidemics and public health emergencies.","Chen, Simiao; Zhang, Zongjiu; Yang, Juntao; Wang, Jian; Zhai, Xiaohui; Bärnighausen, Till; Wang, Chen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,Elsevier,10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30744-3,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

440,Rapid surveillance of COVID-19 in the United States using a prospective space-time scan statistic: Detecting and evaluating emerging clusters,"Abstract. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a pandemic with an estimated death rate between 1% and 5%; and an estimated R 0 between 2.2 and 6.7 according to various sources. As of March 28th, 2020, there were over 649,000 confirmed cases and 30,249 total deaths, globally. In the United States, there were over 115,500 cases and 1891 deaths and this number is likely to increase rapidly. It is critical to detect clusters of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve decision-making as the outbreaks continue to grow. Using daily case data at the county level provided by Johns Hopkins University, we conducted a prospective spatial-temporal analysis with SaTScan. We detect statistically significant space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. between January 22nd-March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd-March 27th, 2020. The space-time prospective scan statistic detected “active” and emerging clusters that are present at the end of our study periods – notably, 18 more clusters were detected when adding the updated case data. These timely results can inform public health officials and decision makers about where to improve the allocation of resources, testing sites; also, where to implement stricter quarantines and travel bans. As more data becomes available, the statistic can be rerun to support timely surveillance of COVID-19, demonstrated here. Our research is the first geographic study that utilizes space-time statistics to monitor COVID-19 in the U.S.","Desjardins, M.R.; Hohl, A.; Delmelle, E.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102202,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102202,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102202,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

444,Innovations in HIV-1 Vaccine Design,"Abstract Purpose The field of HIV-1 vaccinology has evolved during the last 30 years from the first viral vector HIV gene insert constructs to vaccination regimens using a myriad of strategies. These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward. Methods We conducted a search of 2 electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, for experimental studies that involved new HIV immunogen designs between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they were written in language other than English and/or were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference-only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. Findings The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth during the last 3 decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several new rationally designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last 6 years, including native-like envelope trimers, nanoparticle, and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others. Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials. Implications Rapid developments in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies suggest that a tolerable and effective HIV vaccine may be on the horizon.","Jones, Letitia D.; Moody, M.

445,Future Perspectives of Wastewater-Based Epidemiology: Monitoring Infectious Disease Spread and Resistance to the Community Level,"Abstract Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.","Sims, Natalie; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,Elsevier,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105689,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

In order to analyze the connections between terrorist attacks and tourists' arrivals, occurred between 2002 and the end of 2016, an Unrestricted Vector Autoregressive model was used for multivariate time series analysis. The main results show that terrorist attacks have a strong impact on tourist arrivals and confirm the existence of terrorism spillover, namely the substitution and generalization effects phenomena.","Seabra, Claudia; Reis, Pedro; Abrantes, José Luís",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2019.102811,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2019.102811,Elsevier,10.1016/j.annals.2019.102811,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31
447,A decomposition-ensemble approach for tourism forecasting,"Abstract With the frequent occurrence of irregular events in recent years, the tourism industry in some areas, such as Hong Kong, has suffered great volatility. To enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, data characteristic analysis, and the Elman's neural network model. Using Hong Kong tourism demand as an empirical case, this study firstly investigates how data characteristic analysis is used in a decomposition-ensemble approach. The empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in both point and interval forecasts for different prediction horizons, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting tourism demand, especially for time series with complexity.","Xie, Gang; Qian, Yatong; Wang, Shouyang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,Elsevier,10.1016/j.annals.2020.102891,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

452,Clinical and computed tomographic imaging features of novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2,"Summary Purpose To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. Results Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. Conclusion CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","Xu, Yu-Huan; Dong, Jing-Hui; An, Wei-Min; Lv, Xiao-Yan; Yin, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Jian-Zeng; Dong, Li; Ma, Xi; Zhang, Hong-Jie; Gao, Bu-Lang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017,25/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-25

Methods Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. Results 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3-8) vs. 28 (26-29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death. And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (OR = 0.10, P < 0.001). Conclusions High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients. Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission. Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome. Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.","Wang, Lang; He, Wenbo; Yu, Xiaomei; Hu, Dalong; Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Huafen; Zhou, Jiali; Jiang, Hong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.019,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

468,SAA is a biomarker to distinguish the severity and prognosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Abstract Background To explore the significance of SAA in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected. The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied. All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020. Results COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range. As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans. Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging. Conclusions SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19. Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Huan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Ren, Hongwei; Xu, Lingli; Zhao, Lisha; Chen, Xiaoqiong; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.035,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

471,Why are pregnant women susceptible to COVID-19? An immunological viewpoint,"Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 and became epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world. The virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be genetically similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but distinct from it. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants. In this review, we focused on the reason why pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 and the potential maternal and fetal complications from an immunological viewpoint.","Liu, Hong; Wang, Li-Ling; Zhao, Si-Jia; Kwak-Kim, Joanne; Mor, Gil; Liao, Ai-Hua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2020.103122,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2020.103122,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jri.2020.103122,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
472,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"Abstract A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants’ basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = .810, 95% CI = .709 - .925), family income stability (OR = .726, 95% CI = .645 - .817) and living with parents (OR = .752, 95% CI = .596 - .950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 - 3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P < .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P < .001). It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics.","Cao, Wenjun; Fang, Ziwei; Hou, Guoqiang; Han, Mei; Xu, Xinrong; Dong, Jiaxin; Zheng, Jianzhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

The study focuses on assess the psychological status of them. The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires. Occurrence of fear, anxiety and depression were measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS) on fear, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors’ institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression.

476,"Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak","ABSTRACTS We assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of confinement to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China. On Feb 20–21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon individuals’ existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epidemiologically, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Zhang, Stephen X; Wang, Yifei; Rauch, Andreas; Wei, Feng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,Elsevier,10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

479,Put a cork in it: Plugging the M2 viral ion channel to sink influenza,"Abstract The ongoing threat of seasonal and pandemic influenza to human health requires antivirals that can effectively supplement existing vaccination strategies. The M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel that is required for virus replication and is an established antiviral target. While licensed adamantane-based M2 antivirals have been historically used, M2 mutations that confer major adamantane resistance are now so prevalent in circulating virus strains that these drugs are no longer recommended. Here we review the current understanding of IAV M2 structure and function, mechanisms of inhibition, the rise of drug resistance mutations, and ongoing efforts to develop new antivirals that target resistant forms of M2.","Jalily, Pouria H.; Duncan, Maggie C.; Fedida, David; Wang, Jun; Tietjen, Ian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,Elsevier,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104780,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27

We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients. We report the antiviral effect of remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 μM, 26.63 μM, 2.55 μM and 0.46 μM, respectively. Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM. Synergy between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 μM in combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield. Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.","Choy, Ka-Tim; Yin-Lam Wong, Alvina; Kaewpreedee, Prathanporn; Sia, Sin-Fun; Chen, Dongdong; Yan Hui, Kenrie Pui; Wing Chu, Daniel Ka; Wai Chan, Michael Chi; Pak-Hang Cheung, Peter; Huang, Xuhui; Peiris, Malik; Yen, Hui-Ling",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786,Elsevier,10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

483,"Suspected myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19: Evidence from front-line clinical observation in Wuhan, China","Abstract Background A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community. Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. Methods We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. Results 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Conclusions The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.","Deng, Qing; Hu, Bo; Zhang, Yao; Wang, Hao; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Hu, Wei; Cheng, Yuting; Yan, Jie; Ping, Haiqin; Zhou, Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

486,The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a focus on congenital heart disease,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.","Tan, Weiyi; Aboulhosn, Jamil",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.063,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28

488,A network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems,"Abstract In data science, networks provide a useful abstraction of the structure of many complex systems, ranging from social systems and computer networks to biological networks and physical systems. Healthcare service systems are one of the main social systems that can also be understood using network-based approaches, for example, to identify and evaluate influential providers. In this paper, we propose a network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems. First, the provider-interacting network is constructed by employing publicly available information on locations and types of healthcare services of providers. Second, the ranking of nodes in the generated provider-interacting network is conducted in parallel on the basis of four nodal influence metrics. Third, the impact of the top-ranked influential nodes in the provider-interacting network is evaluated using three indicators. Compared with other research work based on patient-sharing networks, in this paper, the provider-interacting network of healthcare service providers can be roughly created according to the locations and the publicly available types of healthcare services, without the need for personally private electronic medical claims, thus protecting the privacy of patients. The proposed method is demonstrated by employing Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2017, and can be applied to other similar datasets to help make decisions for the optimization of healthcare resources in the response to public health emergencies.","Qi, Xiaoyu; Mei, Gang; Cuomo, Salvatore; Xiao, Lei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

490,"Radiotherapy Workflow and Protection Procedures During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak: Experience of the Hubei Cancer Hospital in Wuhan, China","Abstract The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019, and reached its peak in Wuhan in February 2020. It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

491,Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: perspectives from the radiation oncology service in singapore,"Abstract In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO. The outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it was named ‘COVID-19’. The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23rd January 2020. With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak. The government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission. Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the disease. There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an infectious disease outbreak. This article is the recommendations and adapted workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, Singapore. It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses.

494,"Characterization, Pathogenicity and Protective efficacy of a Cell Culture-Derived Porcine Deltacoronavirus","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses to the pig industry. However, there is currently little information on vaccine studies and commercially available vaccines for PDCoV. Hence, herein, a PDCoV strain, CH/XJYN/2016, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in vitro, and its biological characteristics were determined. Compared to that of previously reported and recently isolated PDCoV strains from China and the United States, the S gene of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain contains novel mutations. Infection studies revealed that CH/XJYN/2016 is pathogenic to suckling piglets and conventional weaned pigs. In addition, the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of PDCoV in conventional weaned pigs was determined (2.0 log10PDD50/3 mL). Furthermore, an inactivated cell-adapted CH/XJYN/2016-based vaccine candidate was developed with different adjuvants. Compared with nonvaccinated pigs, conventional weaned pigs given the inactivated vaccine developed a potent humoral immune response and showed no clinical signs or viral shedding after challenge, indicating a potent protective effect of the vaccine against PDCoV infection. Therefore, the PDCoV vaccine developed in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be used for the control of PDCoV infection in pigs.","Gao, Xiang; Zhao, Donghong; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Liping; Li, Mingxia; Li, Weiyan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu; Liu, Xinsheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,Elsevier,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

501,Practical Strategies Against the Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19—the Imminent Global Threat,"The last month of 2019 harbingered the emergence of a viral outbreak that is now a major public threat globally. COVID-19 was first diagnosed and confirmed in a couple of cases with unknown pneumonia; the patients lived in, or travelled to, Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. People now face a complex challenge that deserves urgent intervention by all involved in medical healthcare globally. Conventional antiviral therapies or vaccines are the most referred means of tackling the virus, but we think establishing these ideal management strategies is presently far-fetched. In-house isolation or quarantine of suspected cases to keep hospital admissions manageable and prevent in-hospital spread of the virus, and promoting general awareness about transmission routes are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. Cases with weakened or compromised immune systems—for example, elderly individuals, young children, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases—are particularly more susceptible to COVID-19. Hopefully, cumulative data using whole-genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in parallel with mathematical modeling will help the molecular biologists to understand unknown features of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.005,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
502,Can Bioactive Lipids Inactivate Coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS are all enveloped viruses that can cause acute respiratory syndrome. Arachidonic acid (AA) and other unsaturated fatty acids (especially eicosapentaenoic acd, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA) are known to inactivate enveloped viruses and inhibit proliferation of various microbial organisms. The pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA and EPA such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes induce inflammation whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and augment phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load. In view of these actions, it is suggested that AA and other unsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites may serve as endogenous anti-viral compounds and their deficiency may render humans susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS and other similar viruses’ infections. Hence, oral or intravenous administration of AA and other unsaturated fatty acids may aid in enhancing resistance and recovery from SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS infections.","Das, Undurti N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.03.004,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27

519,Racial Differences in Time to Treatment for Melanoma,"Abstract Background Longer time from diagnosis to definitive surgery (TTDS) is associated with increased melanoma-specific mortality. Although Black patients present with later stage melanoma and have worse survival than non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients, the association between race and TTDS is unknown. Objective To investigate racial differences in time to melanoma treatment. Methods Retrospective review of the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with TTDS controlling for sociodemographic/disease characteristics. Results Of the 233,982 melanoma patients identified, 1,221 (0.52%) were Black. Black patients had longer TTDS for stage I-III melanoma (p<0.001) and time to immunotherapy (p=0.01), but not for TTDS for stage IV melanoma or time to chemotherapy (p>0.05 for both). Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, Black patients had over twice the odds of having TTDS between 41-60 days, over three times the odds of having TTDS between 61-90 days, and over five times the odds of having TTDS over 90 days. Racial differences in TTDS persisted within each insurance type. Patients with Medicaid had the longest TTDS (mean 60.4 days), and those with private insurance had the shortest TTDS (mean 44.6 days; p<0.001 for both). Conclusions Targeted approaches to improve TTDS for Black patients are integral in reducing racial disparities in melanoma outcomes.","Tripathi, Raghav; Archibald, Laura K.; Mazmudar, Rishabh S.; Conic, Rosalynn RZ.; Rothermel, Luke D.; Scott, Jeffrey F.; Bordeaux, Jeremy S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.094,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

529,"Antimicrobial resistance in southern China: results of prospective surveillance in Dongguan city, 2017","SUMMARY Background Few studies have estimated the burden of infections due to antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens in China. Aim To summarize antimicrobial resistance and assess the frequency of community-associated infections (CAIs) and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) due to AMR pathogens in Dongguan city, China. Methods Seven acute care hospitals provided antimicrobial susceptibility data for 2017, from which ‘bug–drug’ combinations were analysed. To calculate incidence proportions of CAI and incidence densities of HCAI, data from three tertiary care hospitals were merged with patient data, obtained from the Dongguan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. Findings A total of 16,548 pathogens were analysed. Non-susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 43.9% and 30.2%, respectively. Non-susceptibility to carbapenems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was 29.5% and 50.9%, respectively. A quarter of Staphylococcus aureus (26.3%) were non-susceptible to oxacillin. The incidence density of HCAI due to E. coli non-susceptible to 3GCs and fluoroquinolones combined was 0.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.11) per 1000 patient-days. Both E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens isolated from blood. Compared with the 2017 European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network report, the incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant E. coli was significantly higher (14.9% and 4.6%, respectively). Conclusion The incidence of non-susceptible bug–drug combinations in Dongguan city was lower compared with China as a whole. Non-susceptible bug–drug combinations were significantly more frequent in HCAI compared with CAI. The incidence proportion of bloodstream infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens in Dongguan City was higher compared with Europe.","Wang, J.; Zhou, M.; Huang, G.; Guo, Z.; Sauser, J.; Metsini, A.; Pittet, D.; Zingg, W.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.029,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

532,Risk of nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease 2019: an experience in a general ward setting in Hong Kong,"SUMMARY Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. Aim To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. Method Contacts were identified and risk categorized as ‘close’ or ‘casual’ for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Findings A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of ‘close contact’. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. Conclusion Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.","Wong, S.C.-Y.; Kwong, R.T.-S.; Wu, T.C.; Chan, J.W.M.; Chu, M.Y.; Lee, S.Y.; Wong, H.Y.; Lung, D.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

539,"Examining the inclusion of patients and their family members in infection prevention and control policies and guidelines across Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea","Background Although familial involvement during inpatient care is not uncommon in western countries, the types of caring activities that family members in Asian countries provide are significantly different. These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care–associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients’ families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middle-income country), and South Korea (high-income country). Methods The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries’ guidelines. Conclusions Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea.","Park, Ji Yeon; Pardosi, Jerico Franciscus; Seale, Holly",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2019.10.001,07/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-07
540,To investigate the association between the health literacy and hand hygiene practices of the older adults to help them fight against infectious diseases in Hong Kong,"Background Proper hand hygiene helps prevent infectious diseases, while health literacy plays a critical role in preventive health behaviors. It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases. Methods A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire. Results The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants’ health literacy and their hand hygiene practices. Conclusions Health literacy and hand hygiene are positively related in helping the older adults fight against infectious diseases. To sustain proper hand hygiene practices is to provide frequent hand hygiene training to the older adults.","Or, Peggy Pui-Lai; Wong, Bonny Yee-Man; Chung, Joanne Wai-Yee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2019.12.021,07/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-07
541,Viral and bacterial coinfection among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections,"Background The epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and local dominant etiologies of pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs) among central China children (≤14 years old) hospitalized are poorly understood. Methods A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Results It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs. Conclusions MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI. These findings will contribute to the effective prevention and therapeutic approaches of pathogens among local children suffering from RTI.","Liu, Junxiao; Wang, Mengli; Zhao, Zhihong; Lin, Xiao; Zhang, Pei; Yue, Qingfen; Zhang, Ting; Meng, Yujuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.01.013,26/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-26

544,A Qualitative Study on the Psychological Experience of Caregivers of COVID-19 Patients,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Method Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from 20 January to 10 February 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","Sun, Niuniu; Shi, Suling; Jiao, Dandan; Song, Runluo; Ma, Lili; Wang, Hongwei; Wang, Chao; Wang, Zhaoguo; You, Yanli; Liu, Shuhua; Wang, Hongyun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

El SARS-CoV-2ha presentado una transmisión rápida de persona a persona y actualmente es una pandemia mundial. En la mayor serie de casos descrita hasta la fecha de pacientes hospitalizados con enfermedad por SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoViD), el 26% requirió atención en una unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI). Esta pandemia está provocando una movilización de la comunidad científica sin precedentes, lo que lleva asociado un numero exponencialmente creciente de publicaciones en relación con la misma. La presente revisión bibliográfica narrativa, tiene como objetivo reunir las principales aportaciones en el área de los cuidados intensivos hasta la fecha en relación con la epidemiología, clínica, diagnóstico y manejo de 2019-nCoViD. Abstract On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Hubei Province of China first unveiled a group of unexplained cases of pneumonia, which WHO subsequently defined as the new coronavirus of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2).

550,Recomendaciones de consenso respecto al soporte respiratorio no invasivo en el paciente adulto con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda secundaria a infección por SARS-CoV-2,"Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Gómez, César Cinesi; Rodríguez, Óscar Peñuelas; Torné, Manel Luján; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jiménez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fernández, Javier García; Manuel Carratalá Perales, José; Heili-Frades, Sarah Béatrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andrés Nilsson, José M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis Sánchez; Ignacio Garrote, José; Serrano, Miguel J Zamorano; Martínez, Mónica González; Muñoz, Eva Farrero; Andrés, Olga Mediano San; Cervera, Gemma Rialp; Serra, Arantxa Mas; Martínez, Gonzalo Hernández; de Haro López, Candelaria; Gas, Oriol Roca; Roca, Ricard Ferrer; Berrocal, Antonio Romero; Ortola, Carlos Ferrando",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medin.2020.03.005,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

Sin embargo, en la esclerosis múltiple, no existe un modelo que permita una visión general de la enfermedad, de forma que es necesario utilizar una variedad de modelos que abarquen los distintos cambios que se producen. Desarrollo Se revisan los distintos modelos experimentales que pueden ser utilizados en la investigación en la esclerosis múltiple, tanto in vitro como in vivo. En relación a los modelos in vitro se analizan los distintos cultivos celulares y sus potenciales modificaciones así como los modelos en rodajas. En los modelos in vivo, se analizan los modelos de base inmune-inflamatoria como la encefalitis alérgica experimental en los distintos animales, además de las enfermedades desmielinizantes por virus. Por otro lado, se analizan los modelos de desmielinización-remielinización incluyéndose las lesiones químicas por cuprizona, lisolecitina, bromuro de etidio, así como el modelo de zebrafish y los modelos transgénicos. Conclusiones Los modelos experimentales nos permiten acercarnos al conocimiento de los diversos mecanismos que ocurren en la esclerosis múltiple. La utilización de cada uno de ellos depende de los objetivos de investigación que planteen. Abstract Introduction Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.A.; Gómez-Pinedo, U.; Matías-Guiu, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.002,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
558,¿Es esperable que haya cuadros neurológicos por la pandemia de SARS2-CoV?,"Resumen Introducción: Diversas evidencias sugieren que el SARS2-CoV puede penetrar en el SNC. Los autores revisan los datos de la literatura sobre los hallazgos de Coronavirus en el SNC asociado a enfermedades neurológicas. Desarrollo: En las distintas epidemias con SARS-CoV y MERS-CoV la presencia de cuadros neurológicos es baja, pero se describen cuadros aislados de pacientes. También existen casos asociados a OC43-CoV y 229E-CoV. La existencia de lesiones neurológicas, especialmente desmielinizantes en el modelo MHV-CoV pueden explicar mecanismos de penetración de los CoV en el SNC y especialmente aquellos relacionados con la respuesta inmune, que puede justificar la existencia de CoV en pacientes con Esclerosis Múltiple. Los autores revisan aspectos diferenciales de SARS2-CoV y se plantean si debido al alto número de infectados, el virus puede afectar de forma mayor al SNC. Conclusión: Aunque la presencia de síntomas neurológicos en las epidemas de CoV es baja, la mayor frecuencia de infectados por SARS2-CoV podría justificar el paso del virus y la posibilidad de clínica neurológica precoz o tardía con mayor incidencia. El seguimiento de los pacientes de la epidemia debe atender con cuidado a la evaluación del SNC. Abstract Introduction. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development. Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion. Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, Jorge; Gomez-Pinedo, Ulises; Montero-Escribano, Paloma; Gomez-Iglesias, Patricia; Porta-Etessam, Jesus; Matias-Guiu, Jordi A",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrl.2020.03.001,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

Method: Ecological study of a group of countries with more than 200 reported cases. Demographic variables, health expenditure variables, and variables about characteristics of health services were included as explanatory variables. and incidence, mortality and fatality rates have been analyzed as response variables. In addition, a relative fatality index has been created. Data are from international organizations. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the associations. Results: Number of tests and of medical professionals are associated with a higher incidence rate. Mortality and case fatality rate are not associated with demographic, health expenditure, or health services variables. Conclusion: Differences suggest a general underestimation of the magnitude of the epidemic. Improvement of case identification and effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems is necessary.","de Figueiredo, Alexandre Medeiros; Codina, Antonio Daponte; de Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina Moreira Marculino; Gil-García, Eugenia; Kalache, Alexandre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

Recently, it emerges as an alternative approach for the rapid identification and development of new pharmaceuticals for various rare and complex diseases for which lack the effective drug treatments. The success rate of drugs repurposing approach accounts for approximately 30% of new FDA approved drugs and vaccines in recent years. This review focuses on the status of drugs repurposing approach for various diseases including skin diseases, infective, inflammatory, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

563,ESPEN expert statements and practical guidance for nutritional management of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Summary The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C.; Krznaric, Zeljko; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.022,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

590,Recombinant infectious bronchitis coronavirus H120 with the spike protein S1 gene of the nephropathogenic IBYZ strain remains attenuated but induces protective immunity,"Abstract Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious viral disease responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry. A reverse genetic vaccine is a safe, rapid, and effective method of achieving IB prevention and control. In this study, we constructed the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, using a reverse genetic system, based on the backbone of the H120 vaccine strain, with the S1 gene replaced with that of the QX-like nephropathogenic strain, ck/CH/IBYZ/2011, isolated in China. The results of dwarf chicken embryos, growth kinetics, and viral titration in the embryos demonstrated that the biological characteristics of the recombinant virus remained unchanged. Like the rH120-infected group and in contrast to the rIBYZ-infected group, no mortality, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rH120-S1/YZ. The viral loads in various tissues, cloacal, and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples, indicating that the rH120-S1/YZ strain was highly safe in chicks. Compared to rH120 vaccination group, when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the QX-like IBV strain, better protection, with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rH120-S1/YZ. Increased levels of IBV-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination. Collectively, our results suggest that the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, may represent a promising vaccine candidate against QX-like IBVs.","Jiang, Yi; Cheng, Xu; Zhao, Xiumei; Yu, Yan; Gao, Mingyan; Zhou, Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.01.001,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
591,Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?,"Abstract This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lethality and the atmospheric pollution in Northern Italy. Indeed, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna are Italian regions with both the highest level of virus lethality in the world and one of Europe’s most polluted area. Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects. We conclude that the high level of pollution in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.","Conticini, Edoardo; Frediani, Bruno; Caro, Dario",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,Elsevier,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

604,The Roles of Bacteria and Viruses in Bronchiectasis Exacerbation: A Prospective Study,"Abstract Background Exacerbations are crucial events during bronchiectasis progression. Objectives To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3–6 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. Results The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0–2.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76–6.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35–4.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11–4.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P <.05). Sputum interleukin-1β levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P <.05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P =.019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. Conclusions Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.","Chen, Chun-Lan; Huang, Yan; Yuan, Jing-Jing; Li, Hui-Min; Han, Xiao-Rong; Martinez-Garcia, Miguel Angel; de la Rosa-Carrillo, David; Chen, Rong-chang; Guan, Wei-Jie; Zhong, Nan-Shan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.arbres.2019.12.010,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
605,Recomendaciones de consenso respecto al soporte respiratorio no invasivo en el paciente adulto con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda secundaria a infección por SARS-CoV-2*,"Resumen La enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) es una infección del tracto respiratorio causada por un nuevo coronavirus emergente, que se reconoció por primera vez en Wuhan, China, en diciembre de 2019. Actualmente, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha definido la infección como pandemia y existe una situación de emergencia sanitaria y social para el manejo de esta nueva infección. Mientras que la mayoría de las personas con COVID-19 desarrollan solo una enfermedad leve o no complicada, aproximadamente el 14% desarrolla una enfermedad grave que requiere hospitalización y oxígeno, y el 5% puede requerir ingreso en una Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (1). En casos severos, COVID-19 puede complicarse por el síndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda (SDRA), sepsis y shock séptico y fracaso multiorgánico. Este documento de consenso se ha preparado sobre directrices basadas en evidencia desarrolladas por un panel multidisciplinario de profesionales médicos de cuatro sociedades científicas españolas (Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias [SEMICYUC], Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica [SEPAR], Sociedad Española de Urgencias y Emergencias [SEMES], Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor [SEDAR]) con experiencia en el manejo clínico de pacientes con COVID-19 y otras infecciones virales, incluido el SARS, así como en sepsis y SDRA. El documento proporciona recomendaciones clínicas para el soporte respiratorio no invasivo (ventilación no invasiva, oxigenoterapia de alto flujo con cánula nasal) en cualquier paciente con presentación sospechada o confirmada de COVID-19 con insuficiencia respiratoria aguda. Esta guía de consenso debe servir como base para una atención optimizada y garantizar la mejor posibilidad de supervivencia, así como permitir una comparación fiable de las futuras intervenciones terapéuticas de investigación que formen parte de futuros estudios observacionales o de ensayos clínicos. Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Gómez, César Cinesi; Rodríguez, Óscar Peñuelas; Torné, Manel Luján; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jiménez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fernández, Javier García; Manuel Carratalá Perales, José; Heili-Frades, Sarah Béatrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andrés Nilsson, José M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis Sánchez; Ignacio Garrote, José; Serrano, Miguel J.

Ya que la mayoría de estas son periféricas en este documento de consenso proponemos el uso de la ecografía torácica para el diagnóstico precoz y la evaluación diaria de la progresión de lesiones pulmonares por un solo explorador sin necesidad de utilizar la TC de tórax. En este consenso se propone la realización de una exploración sistemática ecográfica del tórax dividiéndolo por cuadrantes e identificando los signos ecográficos que se relacionen con el tipo de afectación parenquimatosa o pleural que tiene el paciente: líneas A, líneas B, condensación parenquimatosa, línea pleural y derrame pleural. Estos hallazgos nos facilitarán la toma de decisiones respecto al manejo del paciente, tanto en la decisión del lugar de ingreso del paciente como en el tipo de tratamiento que debemos pautar. Abstract The great pulmonary affectation produced by the COVID-19 infection, requires a fast diagnostic tool that complements the diagnostic test by PCR and which is also useful in evaluating the progression of lung lesions. Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT. In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.

Documento conjunto de la Sección de Cardiología Geriátrica de la Sociedad Española de Cardiología y la Sociedad Española de Geriatría y Gerontología,"Resumen La infección por SARS-CoV-2, denominada COVID-19 (Coronavirus Infectious Disease-19), es una enfermedad desconocida hasta diciembre de 2019 a la que nos enfrentamos en España desde el 31 de enero de 2020 —fecha del primer caso diagnosticado en nuestro país— y que ya ha causado la muerte de 7.340 personas (a 30 de marzo de 2020), sobre todo mayores. Es importante tener en cuenta que, dado que la información evoluciona con extremada rapidez en este campo, lo expuesto en el presente documento puede estar sujeto a modificaciones. La población de mayor edad es especialmente susceptible a la infección por COVID-19, así como a desarrollar criterios de gravedad. Este aumento de morbimortalidad en el paciente mayor se ha asociado tanto con las comorbilidades, especialmente la enfermedad cardiovascular, como con la situación de fragilidad, que conlleva una respuesta inmunológica más pobre. La situación actual, tanto por los países afectados como por el número de casos, constituye una pandemia y supone una emergencia sanitaria de primer nivel. Como España es uno de los países más envejecidos del mundo, la COVID-19 se ha convertido en una emergencia geriátrica. El presente documento se ha elaborado conjuntamente entre la Sección de Cardiología Geriátrica de la Sociedad Española de Cardiología y la Sociedad Española de Geriatría y Gerontología. Abstract SARS-CoV2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease-19), was first identified in December 2019. In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency. Because Spain has one of the largest older populations in the world, COVID-19 has emerged as a geriatric emergency.

616,Testing for multiple bubbles in the copper price: Periodically collapsing behavior,"Abstract This study investigates whether multiple bubbles exist in the copper price on the basis of the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) approach (Phillips et al., 2013). This technique delivers date-stamping strategies for the emergence as well as collapse of explosive bubble episodes and is best suited for practical application to time series. The results reveal that four explosive bubbles are detected over the period of 1980–2019 when copper price deviates from fundamental value. Besides, this finding is in accordance with the asset pricing model (Gürkaynak, 2008), which generally considers both fundamental and bubble components in the presence of asset prices. Based on the empirical results, the multiple emergence and collapse of multiple price bubbles are attributed to speculation, depreciation of the U.S. dollar, an imbalance between supply and demand, and financial crises. Policymakers should actively recognize bubble episodes and monitor their evolution, which could be conducive to achieving the effective stabilization of the international copper price. To reduce excess price fluctuations and explosive copper bubbles, authorities should impose restrictions on excessive speculative behaviors under extreme market conditions.","Su, Chi-Wei; Wang, Xiao-Qing; Zhu, Haotian; Tao, Ran; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia; Lobonţ, Oana-Ramona",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101587,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but no data concerning kidney transplant (KTx) recipients infected with COVID-19 are available. To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset. Four patients received a reduced dose of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy during hospitalization. As of March 4, 2020 NAT was negative for COVID-19 in three patients twice in succession, and their computed tomography scans showed improved images. Although greater patient numbers and long-term follow-up data are needed, our series demonstrates that mild COVID-19 infection in KTx recipients can be managed using symptomatic support therapy combined with adjusted maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.","Zhang, Hui; Chen, Yan; Yuan, Quan; Xia, Qiu-Xiang; Zeng, Xian-Peng; Peng, Jing-Tao; Liu, Jing; Xiao, Xing-Yuan; Jiang, Guo-Song; Xiao, Han-Yu; Xie, Liang-Bo; Chen, Jing; Liu, Jia-Li; Xiao, Xiong; Su, Hua; Zhang, Chun; Zhang, Xiao-Ping; Yang, Hua; Li, Heng; Wang, Zhen-Di",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Herein, we hypothesize that BCG vaccination policies adopted by different countries might influence the SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns and/or COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality through the vaccine’s capacity to confer heterologous protection. We also postulate that until a specific vaccine is developed, SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable populations could be immunized with BCG vaccines to attain heterologous nonspecific protection from the new coronavirus.","Gursel, Mayda; Gursel, Ihsan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109707,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109707,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109707,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
628,Changing the narrative on fisheries subsidies reform: Enabling transitions to achieve SDG 14.6 and beyond Andrés M. Cisneros-Montemayor,"Abstract The World Trade Organization (WTO) is in the final stages of negotiating an agreement to prohibit harmful fisheries subsidies, thereby achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6. An effective agreement should be viewed as an opportunity for nations to proactively transition towards sustainable and equitable fisheries and pave the path for other SDGs. Supporting fishers does not require harmful subsidies, and we provide evidence-based options for reform that highlight equity needs while reducing environmental harm. Subsidy reforms need clear goals, co-design, transparency, and fair implementation. An agreement on SDG 14.6 could be a turning point for the oceans and for the well-being of those that depend on the oceans for livelihoods and nutrition. Responsible seafood production will require international cooperation not only at WTO, but among governments, fisher organizations, civil society, and the wider public.","Cisneros-Montemayor, Andrés M.; Ota, Yoshitaka; Bailey, Megan; Hicks, Christina C.; Khan, Ahmed S.; Rogers, Anthony; Sumaila, U.

635,Healthcare impact of COVID-19 epidemic in India: A stochastic mathematical model,"Abstract Background In India, the SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 epidemic has grown to 1,251 cases and 32 deaths as on 30 Mar 2020. The healthcare impact of the epidemic in India was studied with a stochastic mathematical model. Methods A compartmental SEIR model was developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations. Different scenarios were modeled with 1000 runs of Monte Carlo simulation each using MATLAB. Hospitalization, ICU requirements and deaths were modeled on SimVoi software. The impact of Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPI) including social distancing and lockdown on checking the epidemic was estimated. Results Uninterrupted epidemic in India would have resulted in over 364 million cases and 1.56 million deaths with peak by mid-July. As per the model, at growth rate of 1.15, India is likely to reach approximately 3 million cases by 25 May, implying 125,455 (±18,034) hospitalizations, 26,130 (±3,298) ICU admissions and 13,447 (±1,819) deaths. This would overwhelm India’s healthcare system. The model shows that with immediate institution of NPIs, the epidemic might still be checked by mid-April 2020. It would then result in 241,974 (±33,735) total infections, 10,214 (±1,649) hospitalizations, 2,121 (±334) ICU admissions and 1,081(±169) deaths. Conclusion At current growth rate of epidemic, India’s healthcare resources will be overwhelmed by end-May. With the immediate institution of NPIs, total cases, hospitalizations, ICU requirements and deaths can be reduced by almost 90%.","Chatterjee, Kaustuv; Chatterjee, Kaushik; Kumar, Arun; Shankar, Subramanian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.03.022,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

637,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"Abstract COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic. This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population – and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.","Grech, Victor",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
638,A delayed vaccinated epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and Lévy jumps,"Abstract A stochastic susceptible–infectious–recovered epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate is formulated to discuss the effects of temporary immunity, vaccination, and Le.́vy jumps on the transmission of diseases. We first determine the existence of a unique global positive solution and a positively invariant set for the stochastic system. Sufficient conditions for extinction and persistence in the mean of the disease are then achieved by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, we conclude that noise intensity and the validity period of vaccination greatly influence the transmission dynamics of the system.","Fan, Kuangang; Zhang, Yan; Gao, Shujing; Chen, Shihua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,Elsevier,10.1016/j.physa.2019.123379,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15
639,Multi-sectorial research is paramount for preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases,"Abstract The social, economic and political consequences of emerging infectious disease (EID) may escape the sphere in which they first arise. In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous human-environment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertise-based decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs.","Le Turnier, P.; Leport, C.; Martin, P.; Jadand, C.; Hoen, B.; Guégan, J.-F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.respe.2019.09.009,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

642,C-reactive protein levels in the early stage of COVID-19,"Abstract Background: COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, for which there is currently no treatment. It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. Objective: We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. Methods: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. Result: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test = -2.647, -2.171, p˂0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test = 0.693, -2.177, p˂0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test = -0.068, -1.549, p˂0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient = 0.873, 0.734, p˂0.001). Conclusion: In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.","Ling, Wang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

646,Diagnosis of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rRT-PCR or CT?,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion, who were examined by both CT and rRT-PCR at initial presentation. The sensitivities of both tests were then compared. For patients with a final confirmed diagnosis, clinical and laboratory data, in addition to CT imaging findings were evaluated. Results A total of 36 patients were finally diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thirty-five patients had abnormal CT findings at presentation, whereas one patient had a normal CT. Using rRT-PCR, 30 patients were tested positive, with 6 cases initially missed. Amongst these 6 patients, 3 became positive in the second rRT-PCR assay(after 2 days, 2 days and 3 days respectively), and the other 3 became positive only in the third round of rRT-PCR tests(after 5 days, 6 days and 8 days respectively). At presentation, CT sensitivity was therefore 97.2%, whereas the sensitivity of initial rRT-PCR was only 83.3%. Conclusion rRT-PCR may produce initial false negative results. We suggest that patients with typical CT findings but negative rRT-PCR results should be isolated, and rRT-PCR should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.","Long, Chunqin; Xu, Huaxiang; Shen, Qinglin; Zhang, Xianghai; Fan, Bing; Wang, Chuanhong; Zeng, Bingliang; Li, Zicong; Li, Xiaofen; Li, Honglu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108961,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

Methods Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups (<18 years, 18–44 years, 45–59 years, ≥60 years) were compared. Results Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45–59 years and aged ≥60 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients <18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45–59 years, and ≥60 years, than in those aged <18 years, and aged 18–44 years. Conclusions Chest HRCT manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are related to patient’s age, and HRCT signs may be milder in younger patients.","Chen, Zuhua; Fan, Hongjie; Cai, Jian; Li, Yunjiang; Wu, Baoliang; Hou, Yanchun; Xu, Shufeng; Zhou, Fei; Liu, Yongguang; Xuan, Weiling; Hu, Hongjie; Sun, Jihong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108972,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
648,Evaluation of a PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry platform for detection and identification of fungal pathogens directly from prospectively collected bronchoalveolar lavage specimens,"Abstract The incidence of invasive fungal infections is on the rise worldwide due to the growth of the immunocompromised population. We report here the use of a diagnostic assay that utilizes a universal extraction method, broad spectrum PCR amplification and analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to detect and identify more than 200 pathogenic fungi directly from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in less than 8 hours. In this study, we describe both analytical and clinical performance of the assay, when run with prospectively collected clinical BAL specimens. In 146 patients with probable and possible fungal infections defined by EORTC/MSG (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group) criteria, the PCR/ESI-MS assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 76.4–96.9%) and a specificity of 82.3% (95% CI: 74.2–88.2%). This data demonstrates the utility of a non-culture based broad fungal targets molecular diagnostic tool for rapid and accurate diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in patients at risk of developing fungal diseases.","Jia, Bei; Lovari, Robert; Miller, Heather; Metzgar, David; Massire, Christian; Carolan, Heather; Toleno, Donna; D'Alessio, Franco; Rothman, Richard; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Zhang, Sean X.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,Elsevier,10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.114988,15/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-15

650,"Cardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic","Abstract The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients. First, those with COVID-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects.

Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. Conclusion This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","Chavez, Summer; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex; Liang, Stephen Y.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24

657,Are loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators safe during chest compression? A simulation study,"Abstract Background The application of appropriate personal protective equipment for respiratory protection to health care workers is a cornerstone for providing safe healthcare in emergency departments. We investigated the protective effect and usefulness of loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compression. Methods This was a single-center simulation study performed from May 2019 to July 2019 in a tertiary hospital. We measured the concentrations of ambient aerosol and particles inside the loose-fitting PAPR during chest compression, and this ratio was set as the simulated workplace protecting factor (SWPF). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulations, the assigned protection factor (APF) of loose-fitting PAPRs is 25. Thus, the loose-fitting PAPRs were assumed to have a protective effect when the SWPF were ≥ 250 (APF × 10). We measured the SWPF of PAPR in real time during chest compression and also investigated the problems encountered during its use. Results Ninety-one participants (median age 29 [interquartile range (IQR): 26–32] years; 74% female) completed the simulation. None of the participants failed with SWPF below 250 during three sessions of chest compression. The median (IQR) values of SWPF at three cycles were 17,063 (10,145-26,373), 15,683 (9477-32,394), and 16,960 (7695-27,279). There was no disconnection of equipment or mechanical failures during chest compression. In addition, most participants (83%) replied that they rarely or never experienced difficulty in verbal communication and felt that the loose-fitting PAPR was comfortable. Conclusions The loose-fitting PAPRs provided sufficient respiratory protection without disturbances during chest compression.","Park, Soo Hyun; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Lee, Guntak; Park, Jong Eun; Kim, Taerim; Shin, Tae Gun; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon; Kim, Seonwoo; Yoon, Hee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

The overlap in the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment. However, identifying features atypical for COVID-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of Computed Tomography Angiography among these patients.

This pandemic has placed considerable stress on health care resources and providers. This document from the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology - Association Canadienne de Cardiologie d'intervention, specifically addresses the implications for the care of patients in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory (CCL) in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key principles of this document are to maintain essential interventional cardiovascular care while minimizing risks of COVID-19 to patients/staff and maintaining the overall healthcare resources. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, procedures will be increased or reduced based on the current level of restriction to health care services. While some consistency across the country is desirable, provincial and regional considerations will influence how these recommendations are implemented. We believe the framework and recommendations in this document will provide crucial guidance for clinicians and policy makers on the management of coronary and structural procedures in the CCL as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates and eventually abates.","Wood, David A.; Sathananthan, Janarthanan; Gin, Ken; Mansour, Samer; Ly, Hung Q.; Quraishi, Ata-ur-Rehman; Lavoie, Andrea; Lutchmedial, Sohrab; Nosair, Mohamed; Bagai, Akshay; Bainey, Kevin R.; Boone, Robert H.; Liu, Shuangbo; Krahn, Andrew; Virani, Sean; Mehta, Shamir R.; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Velianou, James L.; Dehghani, Payam; Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Asgar, Anita W.; Virani, Alice; Welsh, Robert C.; Webb, John G.; Cohen, Eric A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.027,24/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-24
667,Characteristic ECG Manifestations in Patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Cardiac involvement has been reported in patients with COVID-19, which may be reflected by ECG changes. Two COVID-19 cases in our report exhibited different ECG manifestations as the disease caused deterioration. The first case presented temporary SIQIIITIII morphology followed by reversible nearly complete atrioventricular block, while the second demonstrated ST segment elevation accompanied by multifocal ventricular tachycardia. The underlying mechanisms of these electrocardiographic abnormalities in the severe stage of COVID-19 may be attributed to hypoxia and inflammatory damage incurred by the virus.","He, Jia; Wu, Bo; Chen, Yaqin; Tang, Jianjun; Liu, Qiming; Zhou, Shenghua; Chen, Chen; Qin, Qingwu; Huang, Kang; Lv, Jianlei; Chen, Yan; Peng, Daoquan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cjca.2020.03.028,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

669,Immunofluorescence and molecular diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus in the naturally infected young cattle and buffaloes from India,"Abstract Pneumonia in bovines is a multifactorial disease manifestation leading to heavy economic losses. Infections of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPI-3) are among the important contributing factors for the development of pneumonia in young animals. These viral agents either primarily cause pneumonia or predispose animals to the development of pneumonia. Although, the role of BRSV and BPI-3 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia is well established, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV and BPI-3 from Indian cattle and buffaloes suffering from pneumonia. In the present investigation, we performed postmortem examinations of 406 cattle and buffaloes which were below twelve months of age. Out of 406 cases, twelve (2.95%) cases were positive for BRSV and fifteen (3.69%) cases were positive for BPI-3, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen having intracytoplasmic inclusions. The BRSV antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. In fifteen cases where BPI-3 was detected, bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the majority of cases with thickened alveolar septa by mild macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type-II pneumocytes and bronchiolar necrosis along with syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusions in the majority of cases were observed. The BPI-3 antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. RT-PCR amplicons of BRSV and BPI-3 obtained were sequenced and their analysis showed homology with already available sequences in the NCBI database. It is the first report of detection of BRSV and BPI-3 from pneumonic cases by RT-PCR and d-FAT from cattle and buffaloes of India, indicating the need for more epidemiological studies.","Kamdi, Bhupesh; Singh, Rajendra; Singh, Vidya; Singh, Shailendra; Kumar, Pawan; Singh, Karam Pal; George, Neethu; Dhama, Kuldeep",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104165,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
670,Lithium chloride confers protection against viral myocarditis via suppression of coxsackievirus B3 virus replication,"Abstract Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a type of inflammation affecting myocardial cells caused by viral infection and has been an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) worldwide. Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl's antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.","Zhao, Yinxia; Yan, Kepeng; Wang, Yanqi; Cai, Jiamin; Wei, Lin; Li, Shuijun; Xu, Wei; Li, Min",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104169,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31
671,Shell disorder analysis predicts greater resilience of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outside the body and in body fluids,"Abstract The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID=8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID=9%, N PID =44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID=48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID=6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

681,Creating a Palliative Care Inpatient Response Plan for COVID19 – The UW Medicine Experience,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare systems throughout the world. Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying co-morbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the US. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, the intensive care units, and the acute care services. The strategy focuses on key content areas including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members. Conclusions Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our healthcare systems. We share our experiences developing such a strategy to help other institutions conduct and adapt such strategies more quickly.","Fausto, James; Hirano, Lianne; Lam, Daniel; Mehta, Amisha; Mills, Blair; Owens, Darrell; Perry, Elizabeth; Curtis, J.

682,Palliative Care Pandemic Pack: a Specialist Palliative Care Service response to planning the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Abstract: Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic. Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning. SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations. Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid up-skilling of non-specialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care. It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively.","Ferguson, Lana; Barham, Deborah",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.026,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
683,Crisis Symptom Management and Patient Communication Protocols Are Important Tools for All Clinicians Responding to COVID-19,"Abstract Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While palliative care specialists have training in these skills, many front-line clinicians from other specialties do not. It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.","Bowman, Brynn A.; Esch, Andrew E.; Back, Anthony L.; Marshall, Nadine",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.028,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
684,The role and response of palliative care and hospice services in epidemics and pandemics: a rapid review to inform practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity. This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to ‘systems’ (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), ‘staff’ (deployment, skill mix, resilience), ‘space’ (community provision, use of technology) and ‘stuff’ (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non-specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.","Etkind, Simon N.; Bone, Anna E.; Lovell, Natasha; Cripps, Rachel L.; Harding, Richard; Higginson, Irene J.; Sleeman, Katherine E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.029,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

686,"Symptom Cluster of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China","Abstract Objective In treating highly infectious COVID-19 pneumonia, ICU nurses face a high risk of developing somatic symptom disorder (SSD). The present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of SSD of ICU nurses treating COVID-19 pneumonia. The research results are expected to provide evidence for the establishment of a better management strategy. Methods This study enrolled a total of 140 ICU nurses who were selected by Jiangsu Province Hospital to work in Wuhan (the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in China) on 3rd February 2020. A questionnaire “Somatic Symptom Disorders for ICU Nurses in Wuhan No.1 Hospital” was designed based on the “International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health” (ICF). Exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms, and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms. Results Five major symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation (31.4%), dyspnea (30.7%), nausea (21.4%), headache (19.3%), and dizziness (17.9%). In exploratory factor analysis, the symptoms were classified into three clusters: Cluster A of breathing and sleep disturbances (dizziness, sleepiness, dyspnea); Cluster B of gastrointestinal complaints and pain (nausea, headache), and Cluster C of general symptoms (xerostomia, fatigue, chest-discomfort-and-palpitation). In Cluster A, urine/feces splash, sex, and sputum splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster B, fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors. In Cluster C, urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors. Conclusion The ICU nurses in Wuhan showed varying and overlapping SSDs. These SSDs could be classified into three symptom clusters. Based on the characteristics of their SSDs, specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of ICU nurses.","Yifan, Tang; Ying, Liu; Chunhong, Gao; Jing, Song; Rong, Wang; Zhenyu, Li; Zejuan, Gu; Peihung, Liao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.039,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
687,Rapid De-Escalation and Triaging Patients in Community-Based Palliative Care,"Abstract Context The COVID-19 pandemic created a rapid and unprecedented shift in our medical system. Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? Measures The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. Conclusions/Lessons Learned We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting. An understanding of infection risk, mutual consent between designated providers, patients, and their families are crucial to maintaining safety while delivering community-based palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tran, David; Lai, Steve; Salah, Ramy; Wong, Angela; Bryon, Jill; McKenna, Meghan; Chan, Yvonne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
688,"Which Melbourne metropolitan areas are vulnerable to COVID-19 based on age, disability and access to health services? Using spatial analysis to identify service gaps and inform delivery","Abstract Ageing adults (65+) with disability are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and upon contracting, are a cohort most likely to require palliative care. Therefore, it is very important that health services - particularly health services providing palliative care - are proximately available. Treating the Melbourne metropolitan area as a case-study, a spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of ageing adults (65+) with disability, and high barriers to accessing primary health services. After, travel times from priority areas to (i) palliative medicine, and (ii) hospital services were calculated. The geographic dispersion of areas with people vulnerable to COVID-19 with poor access to palliative care and health services are clarified. Unique methods of health service delivery are required to ensure that vulnerable populations in under-serviced metropolitan areas receive prompt and adequate care. The spatial methodology employed can be implemented in different contexts to support evidence-based COVID-19 and pandemic palliative care service decisions.","Lakhani, Ali",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.041,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
689,Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study,"Abstract The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.","Kang, Lijun; Ma, Simeng; Chen, Min; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Bai, Hanping; Cai, Zhongxiang; Xiang Yang, Bing; Hu, Shaohua; Zhang, Kerang; Wang, Gaohua; Ma, Ci; Liu, Zhongchun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

691,Nervous system involvement after infection with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses,"Abstract Viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions, and even to cause severe neurological damage. Very recently, coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological diseases. It is reported that CoV can be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the impact of CoV infections on the nervous system. Here, we review the research into neurological complications in CoV infections and the possible mechanisms of damage to the nervous system.","Wu, Yeshun; Xu, Xiaolin; Chen, Zijun; Duan, Jiahao; Hashimoto, Kenji; Yang, Ling; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

693,Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19,"Abstract The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider psychological resilience but also to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.","Kim, Sung-Wan; Su, Kuan-Pin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.025,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

698,Recommendations for coronavirus infection in rheumatic diseases treated with biologic therapy,"Abstract The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.","Ceribelli, Angela; Motta, Francesca; De Santis, Maria; Ansari, Aftab A.; Ridgway, William M.; Gershwin, M.

699,Portable chest X-ray in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): A pictorial review,"Abstract/introduction As the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) progresses, many physicians in a wide variety of specialties continue to play pivotal roles in diagnosis and management. In radiology, much of the literature to date has focused on chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. [1]; Chung et al. [2]). However, due to infection control issues related to patient transport to CT suites, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability in parts of the world, portable chest radiography (CXR) will likely be the most commonly utilized modality for identification and follow up of lung abnormalities. In fact, the American College of Radiology (ACR) notes that CT decontamination required after scanning COVID-19 patients may disrupt radiological service availability and suggests that portable chest radiography may be considered to minimize the risk of cross-infection (American College of Radiology [3]). Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing. The purpose of this pictorial review article is to describe the most common manifestations and patterns of lung abnormality on CXR in COVID-19 in order to equip the medical community in its efforts to combat this pandemic.","Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

701,Custom-made 3D-printed face masks in case of pandemic crisis situations with a lack of commercially available FFP2/3 masks,"Abstract In the case of pandemic crisis situations, a crucial lack of protective material such as protective face masks for healthcare professionals can occur. A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

703,Severe air pollution events not avoided by reduced anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 outbreak,"Abstract Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 μg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 μg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7.78, 9.51, 11.38, 13.42, 13.64, 14.15, 14.42, 16.95 and 22.08 μg/m3 in Shanghai, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Tianjin, Zhengzhou and Wuhan, respectively. The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable. More efforts should be made to completely avoid severe air pollution.","Wang, Pengfei; Chen, Kaiyu; Zhu, Shengqiang; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Hongliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104814,31/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-31

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010). Conclusions Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection. It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.","Zhang, L.; Zhu, F.; Xie, L.; Wang, C.; Wang, J.; Chen, R.; Jia, P.; Guan, H.Q.; Peng, L.; Chen, Y.; Peng, P.; Zhang, P.; Chu, Q.; Shen, Q.; Wang, Y.; Xu, S.Y.; Zhao, J.P.; Zhou, M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.296,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.296,Elsevier,10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.296,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26

Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells. This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.","Baron, Sophie Alexandra; Devaux, Christian; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier; Rolain, Jean-Marc",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105944,13/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-13

So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105946,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105946,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105946,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. Patients and methods French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. Results Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.

718,The cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of severe COVID-19 and Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist Tocilizumab may be the key to reduce the mortality,"Abstract Since December 2019, a viral pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has swept the world. Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

720,Structural and molecular modeling studies reveal a new mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic. In face of the health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle, i.e. the attachment to the surface of respiratory cells mediated by the spike (S) viral protein, offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the ACE-2 receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modeling approaches, we showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. We identified a new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. This domain (aa 111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve the attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate the contact with the ACE-2 receptor. We showed that in presence of CLQ (or of the more active derivative hydroxychloroquine, CLQ-OH), the viral spike is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and stop the pandemic. Our in silico approaches might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before their clinical evaluation.","Fantini, Jacques; Scala, Coralie Di; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105960,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

724,The rippled newsvendor: A new inventory framework for modeling supply chain risk severity in the presence of risk propagation,"Abstract How should managers take into account the propagation of supply chain disruptions and risks (i.e. the ripple effect) when they design their inventory policies? For over 60 years, various extensions and applications to the popular newsvendor model have been suggested, where cost/profit are often the focal objective. We propose a new version of the traditional single-period newsvendor model – the ”Rippled Newsvendor” – with supply chain severity (i.e. risk propagation) as the primary objective while taking into account network structure. Our model considers exogenous and endogenous risk(s) of disruption while exploring the tension between under-supply and ”wear-and-tear” (i.e system breakdown). To model the intricacies of this trade-off whilst minimizing the potential spread of risk, we leverage a Bayesian Network whereby the conditional probability distributions are functions of the inventory ordering decisions. We use a simulation study to understand the nature of our objective function as well as to gain insight into the potential optimal ordering policies of this new model. Furthermore, the simulation seeks to understand how the various factors in our system impact total risk severity, and if they do so in different ways. Our simulations indicate that local exogenous risk is of greater importance than non-local exogenous risk. Furthermore, we show that the type of risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the supply chain and inventory system, impact risk severity differently.","Garvey, Myles D.; Carnovale, Steven",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107752,31/10/2020,NA,NA,2020-10-31

Morphological studies use optical and electronic microscopes to determine the physical damage on the cell-wall and the possible cell lysis that confirms the viability and microorganism death. The key parameters of the tailoring the surface of the photoactive nanostructures such as the metal functionalization with bacteriostatic properties, hydrophilicity, textural porosity, morphology and the formation of heterojunction systems, can achieve the effective eradication of the microorganisms under natural conditions, ranging from practical to applications in environment, agriculture, and so on. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the microorganism/nanomaterial interface approach has rarely been conducted. The final remarks point the ideal photocatalytic way for the effective prevention/eradication of microorganisms, considering the resistance that the microorganism could develop without the appropriate regulatory aspects for human and ecosystem safety.","Rodríguez-González, Vicente; Obregón, Sergio; Patrón-Soberano, Olga A.; Terashima, Chiaki; Fujishima, Akira",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118853,05/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-05

738,A close-up on COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases,"Abstract Aims To analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data Synthesis COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis. The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide. It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population. It targets human’s lung and causes serious damage of lungs. Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious. It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms. In addition, some of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had cardiovascular diseases in China. As characteristic analysis of COVID-19 patients, hypertension and severe myocardial damage contribute to severity [1] and mortality of COVID-19 patients [2]. Therefore, to better understand the development of COVID-19 and the impacts of cardiovascular diseases will add valuable measures to the management of COVID-19 patients.","Li, Gang; Hu, Rui; Gu, Xuefang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
739,"Adjuvant Herbal Therapy for Targeting Susceptibility Genes to Kawasaki Disease: An Overview of Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Pharmacological Treatment of Kawasaki Disease","Abstract Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a self-limiting acute systemic vasculitis occur mainly in infants and young children under 5 years old. Although the use of acetylsalicylic acid (AAS) in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) remains the standard therapy to KD, the etiology, genetic susceptibility genes and pathogenic factors of KD are still un-elucidated. Purpose Current obstacles in the treatment of KD include the lack of standard clinical and genetic markers for early diagnosis, possible severe side effect of AAS (Reye's syndrome), and the refractory KD cases with resistance to IVIG therapy, therefore, this review has focused on introducing the current advances in the identification of genetic susceptibility genes, environmental factors, diagnostic markers and adjuvant pharmacological intervention for KD. Results With an overall update in the development of KD from different aspects, our current bioinformatics data has suggested CASP3, CD40 and TLR4 as the possible pathogenic factors or diagnostic markers of KD. Besides, a list of herbal medicines which may work as the adjunct therapy for KD via targeting different proposed molecular targets of KD have also been summarized. Conclusion With the aid of modern pharmacological research and technology, it is anticipated that novel therapeutic remedies, especially active herbal chemicals targeting precise clinical markers of KD could be developed for accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","Tang, Bin; Lo, Hang Hong; Lei, Cheng; U, Ka In; Hsiao, Wen-Luan Wendy; Guo, Xiaoling; Bai, Jun; Wong, Dr. Vincent Kam-Wai; Law, Dr. Betty Yuen-Kwan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153208,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18
740,NetNCSP: Nonoverlapping closed sequential pattern mining,"Abstract Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has been applied in many fields. However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations.","Wu, Youxi; Zhu, Changrui; Li, Yan; Guo, Lei; Wu, Xindong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,Elsevier,10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
741,DNA vaccines: prime time is now,"Recently newer synthetic DNA vaccines have been rapidly advanced to clinical study and have demonstrated an impressive degree of immune potency and tolerability. Improvements in DNA delivery over prior needle and syringe approaches include jet delivery, gene gun delivery, among others. Among the most effective of these new delivery methods, advanced electroporation (EP), combined with other advances, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity in both preventative as well as therapeutic studies. Advancements in the design of the DNA inserts include leader sequence changes, RNA and codon optimizations, improved insert designs, increased concentrations of DNA, and skin delivery, appear to complement newer delivery strategies. These advances also provide a framework for the in vivo production of synthetic DNA biologics. In this review, we focus on recent studies of synthetic DNA vaccines in the clinic for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases with a focus on adaptive electroporation for delivery, and briefly summarize novel preclinical data advancing the in vivo delivery of DNA-encoded antibody-like biologics.","Gary, Ebony N; Weiner, David B",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.coi.2020.01.006,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

748,Flash Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Pediatric Patients on anti-Cancer Treatment,"Abstract Introduction Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemics, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. Aim and methods We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. Results We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; del Pozo Carlavilla, María; Valerio Alonso, Maria Eli; Domínguez Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; Ten Bosch van der Werff, J.; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Juh Yeoh, Allen Eng; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Marisa; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

750,Reorganization of Medical Oncology Departments during COVID-19 Pandemic: a Nationwide Italian Survey,"Abstract The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic is a global health problem, which started to affect China by the end of year 2019. In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named COVID-19) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits, and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during pandemic.","Indini, Alice; Aschele, Carlo; Bruno, Daniele; Cavanna, Luigi; Clerico, Mario; Fiorentini, Giammaria; Fioretto, Luisa; Giordano, Monica; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Ortega, Cinzia; Pinotti, Graziella; Scanni, Alberto; Zamagni, Claudio; Blasi, Livio; Grossi, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.024,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
751,"Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France","Abstract In this note we analyze the temporal dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China, Italy and France in the time window 22 / 01 − 15 / 03 / 2020 . A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole.","Fanelli, Duccio; Piazza, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109761,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109761,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109761,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

753,Probable Pangolin Origin of SARS-CoV-2 Associated with the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Summary An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in the city of Wuhan in China and has widely spread worldwide. Currently, it is vital to explore potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we reinvestigated published data from pangolin lung samples from which SARS-CoV-like CoVs were detected by Liu et al. [1]. We found genomic and evolutionary evidence of the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2-like CoV (named Pangolin-CoV) in dead Malayan pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical to SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, at the whole-genome level. Aside from RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV is the most closely related CoV to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13. Five key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but four amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG13 lost the putative furin recognition sequence motif at S1/S2 cleavage site that can be observed in the SARS-CoV-2.

759,Decades-old renin inhibitors are still struggling to find a niche in antihypertensive therapy. A fleeting look at the old and the promising new molecules,"Abstract Hypertension is a diverse illness interlinked with cerebral, cardiovascular (CVS) and renal abnormalities. Presently, the malady is being treated by focusing on Renin- angiotensin system (RAS), voltage-gated calcium channels, peripheral vasodilators, renal and sympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular and renal abnormalities are associated with the overactivation of RAS, which can be constrained by angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II (Ang-II) -AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. The latter is a new player in the old system. The renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang-I). This can be overcome by inhibiting renin, a preliminary step, eventually hinders the occurrence of the cascade of events in the RAS. Various peptidomimetics, the first-generation renin inhibitors developed six decades ago have limited drug-like properties as they suffered from poor intestinal absorption, high liver first-pass metabolism and low oral bioavailability. The development of chemically diverse molecules from peptides to nonpeptides expanded the horizon to achieving direct renin inhibition. Aliskiren, a blockbuster drug that emerged as a clinical candidate and got approved by the US FDA in 2007 was developed by molecular modeling studies. Aliskiren indicated superior to average efficacy and with minor adverse effects relative to other RAS inhibitors. However, its therapeutic use is limited by poor oral bioavailability of less than 2% that is similar to first-generation peptidic compounds. In this review, we present the development of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) from peptidic to nonpeptidics that lead to the birth of aliskiren, its place in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and its limitations.","Ramya, Krishnappa; Suresh, Ramalingam; Kumar, Honnavalli Yogish; Kumar, B.R.

766,Gastrointestinal and Liver Manifestations of COVID-19,"Abstract The worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV,-2 has continued to progress, and increasing information is becoming available about the incidence of digestive symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected. These are postulated to be related to the virus’s use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","Agarwal, Amol; Chen, Alan; Ravindran, Nishal; To, Chau; Thuluvath, Paul J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jceh.2020.03.001,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

La situation actuelle de pandémie COVID-19 peut compromettre leur prise en charge à plusieurs niveaux : difficultés d’accès aux établissements de santé largement réorientés vers la prise en charge des malades COVID-19, possible pénurie d’infirmières à domicile, forte réduction des visites des prestataires de service à domicile, tensions sur les solutions hydro-alcooliques, les masques et les régulateurs de débit. Le but de ces recommandations établies par le Comité de Nutrition à Domicile de la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme est, d’une part, de préciser la prise en charge minimale de ces patients, tant en termes de suivi que de matériels, mais surtout de s’adapter aux tensions actuelles relatives aux personnes et aux matériels, afin de poursuivre une prise en charge de qualité et de ne pas compromettre l’état de santé des patients en nutrition artificielle à domicile pendant la crise. Abstract Home artificial nutrition, whether enteral or parenteral, is provided to chronic and fragile patients. The current COVID-19 epidemics may compromise their care at several levels: difficulties to access to hospitals mainly focused on treating COVID-19 patients, possible lack of nurses at home, strong reduction of visits by homecare providers, tended flow or lack of hand sanitizers, surgical masks and pumps. The aim of these recommendations put together by the French-speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM)’s Home Artificial Nutrition Committee is to define in terms of healthcare resources the minimum care to provide to these patients. We also aim to help cope with the possible tensions, in order to secure the care we must provide to home artificial nutrition patients during this crisis.","Schneider, Stéphane M.; Albert, Véronique; Barbier, Nathalie; Barnoud, Didier; Bouteloup, Corinne; Chambrier, Cécile; Fayemendy, Philippe; Flori, Nicolas; Goulet, Olivier; Guimber, Dominique; Jirka, Adam; Joly, Francisca; Lescut, Dominique; Neuville, Sébastien; Piquet, Marie-Astrid; Poullenot, Florian; Quilliot, Didier; Séguy, David; Stocco, Jeanick; Thibault, Ronan; Déchelotte, Pierre",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nupar.2020.03.002,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

777,Approaches to the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during COVID-19 pandemic,"Summary Oral and maxillofacial surgery is correlated with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly. The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively. Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.","Zimmermann, Matthias; Nkenke, Emeka",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcms.2020.03.011,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04
778,Portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet light disinfection in a teaching hospital animal laboratory in China,"Abstract An animal laboratory in a teaching hospital is a possible cause of cross infection. We aimed to assess the infection control in our animal laboratory and evaluate the disinfectant effects of a portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) machine. Samples were taken from the surface of research tables, other high touch places, such as doorknobs, weighing scales, and handles of trolleys, and from air in the barrier system pre- and post-manual cleaning and post-PX-UV disinfection. The bacteria types were identified. We found that routine manual cleaning significantly reduced bacterial colony form unit (CFU)/cm2 (P = .02), and the median of CFU/cm2 reduced from 0.5 pre-cleaning to zero post-cleaning. PX-UV disinfection also significantly reduced residual bacterial counts (P = .002), with the highest counts 10 pre-PX-UV disinfection and 1 afterwards. Without manual cleaning, PX-UV disinfected surfaces significantly (P < .001), median count 6 pre-PX-UV disinfection and zero afterwards. PX-UV significantly reduced bacterial colony counts in the air with the median count falling from 6 to zero (P < .001). Some of the 21 species of pathogens we identified in the current study are pathogenic, resistant to antibiotics, and able to cause nosocomial infections and zoonosis. PX-UV reduced counts of most of the pathogens. PX-UV is an effective agent against these pathogens.","Li, Jing-Jing; Wang, Shan-Ni; Qiao, Jiao-Jiao; Chen, Li-Hua; Li, Yu; Wu, Yong; Ding, Yan-Xia; Wang, Mei-Mei; Tian, Yun; Liu, Yun-Bo; Yan, Chen; Zhang, Chen; Gao, Chang-Qing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.111869,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
779,Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients’ in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients’ management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit. It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.","Alharbi, Ali; Alharbi, Saad; Alqaidi, Shahad",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sdentj.2020.04.001,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07
780,Lianhuaqingwen exerts anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity against novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),"Abstract Purpose Lianhuaqingwen (LH) as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has been used to treat influenza and exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects on a series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects [1]. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. Methods The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Results LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells. Conclusions LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.","Runfeng, Li; Yunlong, Hou; Jicheng, Huang; Weiqi, Pan; Qinhai, Ma; Yongxia, Shi; Chufang, Li; Jin, Zhao; Zhenhua, Jia; Haiming, Jiang; Kui, Zheng; Shuxiang, Huang; Jun, Dai; Xiaobo, Li; Xiaotao, Hou; Lin, Wang; Nanshan, Zhong; Zifeng, Yang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,Elsevier,10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104761,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

785,The Chinese governance system: Its strengths and weaknesses in a comparative development perspective,"Abstract This is an overview paper focusing on the organizational aspects of the Chinese governance system and their relation to development. Compared to other developing countries like India, it has special positive features of career incentives promoting growth at the local level, the ability to take long-term decisions relatively quickly, and a unique blend of political centralization and decentralization of economic power and responsibility, that is conducive to central guidance and local business development. On the other hand, with a lack of sufficient downward (as opposed to upward) accountability and absence of institutionalized systems of scrutiny and challenge from below, mistakes or abuse of power are more difficult to check and correct quickly, political loyalty may often get a premium over performance at the upper levels, and there are insufficient checks on collusion between business and officials. The over-all organizational system is prone to over-reaction in times of crisis and thus only weakly resilient compared to systems where information flows from below are less controlled or choked.","Bardhan, Pranab",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chieco.2020.101430,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

794,Circulating Exosomes from Human Lung Transplant Recipients Having Respiratory Viral Infections Contain Nucleic Acids and Activate Signaling Pathways CGAS/STING and RIG-1,"Purpose Exosomes are membrane bound vesicles are released by cells into body fluids. Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K-α Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Methods Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem's library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Results Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFNβ) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.","Bansal, S.; Limaye, A.; Bharat, A.; Bremner, R.; Smith, M.; Omar, A.; Mohanakumar, T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,Elsevier,10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.986,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

796,"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS DURING THE 2019 CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN WUHAN, CHINA: A DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY REPORT","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic remains unclear. We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients during Dec 20, 2019 and Feb 25, 2020 in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center, retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men and average age was 51 years). 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan related history of travel or contact. The majority took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds. 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. 4 upper airway infection were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the 4th recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. 21.3% recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia and 87.2% of recipients had therapeutic tacrolimus concentration (5-12ng/ml). 5 and 6 recipients had liver and kidney insufficiency respectively. CONCLUSION HTx recipients that practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to COVID-19.

As of mid-March, Singapore remains in a containment mode with enhanced surveillance and limited community spread. Within this context, our service for pediatric eating disorder care has had to make significant adaptations to our models of service delivery as well as respond to the changing psychosocial needs of our patients. Given infection control requirements, we have instituted modular staffing for our inpatient and outpatient settings, necessitating task shifting and an increased use of technology for communication. Due to reduced outpatient capacity and the need to minimize non-urgent trips to the hospital, we have implemented telemedicine and have leveraged on partnerships with school counselors and other community partners. “Coronaphobia” has influenced our patients’ willingness to attend visits and worsened existing health anxiety for some. Responsiveness to families’ and patients’ health and financial concerns has been essential. As COVID-19 impacts more countries, our institution’s experience can provide insight into challenges and possible adaptations to providing ongoing care for eating disorder patients in this environment.","Davis, Courtney; Chong, Ng Kee; Oh, Jean Yin; Baeg, Amerie; Rajasegaran, Kumudhini; Elaine Chew, Chu Shan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.03.037,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.","Ross, Samuel Wade; Lauer, Cynthia W.; Miles, William S.; Green, John M.; Christmas, A Britton; May, Addison K.; Matthews, Brent D.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.019,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
810,Precautions for Operating Room Team Members during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract Background The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can infect healthcare workers. We developed an institutional algorithm to protect operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic and rationally conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Study Design An interventional platform (operating room, interventional suites, and endoscopy) PPE taskforce was convened by the hospital and medical school leadership and tasked with developing a common algorithm for PPE use, to be used throughout the interventional platform. In conjunction with our infection disease experts, we developed our guidelines based upon potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure and conservation of PPE. Results A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing. Conclusion Despite COVID-19 being a new threat, we have shown that by developing an easy-to-follow decision tree algorithm for the interventional platform teams, we can ensure optimal healthcare worker safety.","Forrester, Joseph D.; Nassar, Aussama K.; Maggio, Paul M.; Hawn, Mary T.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.03.030,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic. Nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population.","Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
812,Imaging Features of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Evaluation on Thin-Section CT,"Rationale and Objectives To retrospectively analyze the chest imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on thin-section CT. Materials and Methods Fifty-three patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection underwent thin-section CT examination. Two chest radiologists independently evaluated the imaging in terms of distribution, ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, air bronchogram, stripe, enlarged mediastinal lymph node, and pleural effusion. Results Fourty-seven cases (88.7%) had findings of COVID-19 infection, and the other six (11.3%) were normal. Among the 47 cases, 78.7% involved both lungs, and 93.6% had peripheral infiltrates distributed along the subpleural area. All cases showed GGO, 59.6% of which were round and 40.4% patchy. Other imaging features included “crazy-paving pattern” (89.4%), consolidation (63.8%), and air bronchogram (76.6%). Air bronchograms were observed within GGO (61.7%) and consolidation (70.3%). Neither enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes nor pleural effusion were present. Thirty-three patients (62.3%) were followed an average interval of 6.2 ± 2.9 days. The lesions increased in 75.8% and resorbed in 24.2% of patients. Conclusion COVID-19 showed the pulmonary lesions in patients infected with COVID-19 were predominantly distributed peripherally in the subpleural area.","Guan, Chun Shuang; Lv, Zhi Bin; Yan, Shuo; Du, Yan Ni; Chen, Hui; Wei, Lian Gui; Xie, Ru Ming; Chen, Bu Dong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.acra.2020.03.002,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

818,Cellular evasion strategies of Helicobacter pylori in regulating its intracellular fate,"Abstract Helicobacter pylori colonizes human stomach mucosa and its infection causes gastrointestinal diseases with variable severity. Bacterial infection stimulates autophagy, which is a part of innate immunity used to eliminate intracellular pathogens. Several intracellular bacteria have evolved multipronged strategies to circumvent this conserved system and thereby enhance their chance of intracellular survival. Nonetheless, studies on H. pylori have produced inconsistent results, showing either elevated or reduced clearance efficiency of intracellular bacteria through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the mechanisms involved in autophagy induced by H. pylori and the fate of intracellular bacteria.","Sit, Wei Yang; Chen, Yu-An; Chen, Yu-Lun; Lai, Chih-Ho; Wang, Wen-Ching",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.01.007,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04

Inicialmente confinado a la ciudad de Wuhan, se extendió posteriormente fuera de las fronteras chinas. En España, el primer caso se declaró el 31 de enero de 2020. El 11 de marzo, la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró el brote de coronavirus como pandemia. El 16 de marzo había 139 países afectados. Ante esta situación, las Sociedades Científicas SEMICYUC y SEEIUC han decidido la elaboración de este plan de contingencia para dar respuesta a las necesidades que conllevará esta nueva enfermedad. Se pretende estimar la magnitud del problema e identificar las necesidades asistenciales, de recursos humanos y materiales, de manera que los servicios de medicina intensiva del país tengan una herramienta que les permita una planificación óptima y realista con que responder a la pandemia. Abstract In January 2020, the Chinese authorities identified a new virus of the Coronaviridae family as the cause of several cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. The outbreak was initially confined to Wuhan City, but then spread outside Chinese borders. On 31 January 2020, the first case was declared in Spain. On 11 March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. On 16 March 2020, there were 139 countries affected. In this situation, the Scientific Societies SEMICYUC and SEEIUC, have decided to draw up this Contingency Plan to guide the response of the Intensive Care Services. The objectives of this plan are to estimate the magnitude of the problem and identify the necessary human and material resources.

Socios y socias nos informaban de la falta de equipos de protección individual (EPI), la habilitación rápida de UCI improvisadas en zonas varias de hospitales y el reclutamiento de enfermeras para cubrir turnos. La falta de reconocimiento de la especialidad enfermera en cuidados críticos, englobada dentro la macro especialidad de enfermería médico-quirúrgica, todavía sin desarrollar, ha puesto de relieve la necesidad urgente de aprender de los errores: especialidad, aumentar dotaciones en los equipos de enfermería y proteger el sistema sanitario público. Abstract While we were drafting the recommendations for the joint contingency plan between the Spanish Society of Intensive Care and Coronary Unit Nursing (SEEIUC) and the Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC), predictions were overtaken by events with regard to the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. Members informed us of the lack of personal protection equipment (PPE), the rapid provision of improvised ICUs in various hospital areas and the recruitment of nurses to cover shifts. The failure to recognise the specialty of critical care nursing, included in the macro-specialty of medical-surgical nursing and not yet developed, has highlighted the urgent need to learn from our mistakes: specialisation, increase the number of nurses in teams and protect the public health system.","Raurell-Torredà, M; Martínez-Estalella, G; Frade-Mera, MJ; Carrasco Rodríguez-Rey, LF; Romero de San Pío, E",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfi.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfi.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.enfi.2020.03.002,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

No obstante, la identificación de factores de riesgo (viajes mochileros o inmigrantes en visita a familiares), sus circunstancias (pacientes que no han realizado quimioprofilaxis antipalúdica) y el periodo de aparición de la fiebre (en general menor de 2 semanas) deben alertar. • En los pacientes graves no hay que demorar el inicio de un tratamiento empírico combinado antipalúdico-antibiótico a la espera de resultados microbiológicos.","Valerio, Lluís; Martín-Cano, Silvia Roure y Laura",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fmc.2019.07.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fmc.2019.07.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.fmc.2019.07.004,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

826,Evaluation of the performance of DiaSorin molecular Pneumocystis jirovecii-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay from bronchoalveolar lavage samples,"Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR (PJ-CMV PCR) assay (DiaSorin Molecular LLC, USA) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples compared to direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii and assess CMV and P. jirovecii co-infection rate in immunosuppressed patients with suspected pneumonia. A total of 125 BAL samples from immunosuppressed patients submitted for PJP-IFA were tested. Surplus samples were saved and further tested by using the PJ-CMV PCR assay. Among the 125 samples, P. jirovecii was detected in 31.2% (39/125) and in 40% (50/125) of the specimens using IFA and PJ-CMV PCR respectively. Eleven of the PJ-CMV PCR positive samples were negative by direct IFA for P. jirovecii. All samples positive by direct IFA were also positive by PJ-CMV PCR. Using the direct IFA as a gold standard, the PJ-CMV PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of P. jirovecii were 100%, 87.2%, 78% and 100%, respectively. However, after reviewing the clinical diagnosis, the specificity and PPV increased to 100%. Of the 50 P. jirovecii samples positive by PJ-CMV PCR, 18 (36%) were also positive for CMV by the PJ-CMV PCR. The co-infection rate was found to be 37.5% (6/16) and 35.2% (12/34) in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. This study indicated that the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay has higher sensitivity than direct IFA for detection of P. jirovecii and provides rapid detection of PJ and CMV infection in BAL samples.","Kilic, A.; Elliott, S.; Hester, L.; Palavecino, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mycmed.2020.100936,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

831,Rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the emergency department,"Abstract Background Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for infectious diseases, with a turn-around time <2 hours, are promising tools that could improve patient care, antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention in the emergency department (ED) setting. Numerous RDTs have been developed but not necessarily for the ED environment. Their successful implementation in the ED relies on their performance and impact on patient management. Objectives The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of currently available RDTs for infectious diseases in the ED. Sources PubMed was searched through August 2019 for available studies on RDTs for infectious diseases. Inclusion criteria included: commercial tests approved by the FDA or CE-IVD with data on clinical samples, ability to run on fully-automated systems and result delivery within 2 hours. Content A non-exhaustive list of representative commercially available FDA or CE approved assays was categorized by clinical syndrome: pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, meningitis and encephalitis, fever in the returning traveler and sexually-transmitted infection including HIV. The performance of tests was described based on clinical validation studies. Further, their impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based studies. Implications Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED workflow should be pre-planned considering local constraints of given settings. Additional clinical studies are needed to further evaluate their clinical and cost effectiveness.","Bouzid, Donia; Zanella, Marie-Céline; Kerneis, Solen; Visseaux, Benoît; May, Larissa; Schrenzel, Jacques; Cattoir, Vincent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.02.024,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29

833,Lower respiratory tract infection in the community: associations between viral aetiology and illness course,"Abstract Objectives This study determined associations between respiratory viruses and subsequent illness course in primary care adult patients presenting with acute cough and/or suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Methods A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. Results The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration. Conclusions In healthy, working adults from the general community presenting at the general practitioner with acute cough and/or suspected LRTI respiratory viruses other than influenza impose an illness burden comparable to influenza. Hence, the public health focus for viral respiratory tract infections should be broadened.","Vos, L.M.; Bruyndonckx, R.; Zuithoff, N.P.A.; Little, P.; Oosterheert, J.J.; Broekhuizen, B.D.L.; Lammens, C.; Loens, K.; Viveen, M.; Butler, C.C.; Crook, D.; Zlateva, K.; Goossens, H.; Claas, E.C.J.; Ieven, M.; Van Loon, A.M.; Verheij, T.J.M.; Coenjaerts, F.E.J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.023,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.023,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

836,"COVID-19, SARS and MERS: are they closely related?","Abstract Background The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new human coronavirus which is spreading with epidemic features in China and other Asian countries with cases reported worldwide. This novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which have not been completely understood to date. Objectives We provide a review of the differences in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features between COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Sources The most recent literature in English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. Content COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than SARS (9.5%) and much lower than MERS (34.4%). It cannot be excluded that because of the COVID-19 less severe clinical picture it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than MERS (<1),. The gastrointestinal route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which has been also assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs to be further investigated. Implications There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and capacity of spreading on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons to face this new global threat.","Petrosillo, Nicola; Viceconte, Giulio; Ergonul, Onder; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Petersen, Eskild",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.03.026,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28

839,Rapid and visual detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) by a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"Abstract Objective To evaluate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and compare it with RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods We designed primers specific to the orf1ab and S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Total viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. We optimized the RT-LAMP assay. And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. Results The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (±SD) time was 18 ± 1.32 min and 20 ± 1.80 min, respectively, and 63°C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2×101 copies and 2×102 copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%). This assay detected SARS-CoV-2 in the mean (±SD) time of 26.28 ± 4.48 min and the results can be identified with visual observation. Conclusion These results demonstrate that we developed a rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection among clinical samples. It will be a powerful tool for SARS-CoV-2 identification, and for monitoring suspected patients, close contacts, and high-risk groups.","Yan, Chao; Cui, Jinghua; Huang, Lei; Du, Bing; Chen, Lu; Xue, Guanhua; Li, Shaoli; Zhang, Weiwei; Zhao, Linqing; Sun, Yu; Yao, Hailan; Li, Nannan; Zhao, Hanqing; Feng, Yanling; Liu, Shiyu; Zhang, Qun; Liu, Di; Yuan, Jing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

842,Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Abstract Objectives Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6,284 cases including 42 deaths as of March 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. Methods The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. Results We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age. Conclusions Our results indicate early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.","Shim, Eunha; Tariq, Amna; Choi, Wongyeong; Lee, Yiseul; Chowell, Gerardo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

844,"Epidemiological, clinical characteristics of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal imaging findings","Abstract Purpose To investigate the epidemiological, clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings. Methods Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection of Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 8 underwent CT or x-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological, clinical data were analyzed between those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. Results Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients affected more than two lobes. The median radiograph score was 2.0 and there’s negative correlation between the score and oxygenation index (ρ=-0.657,P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with higher rate of coexisting condition(28.8%), lower rate of exposure history and longer time between onset and confirmation(5d) than non-pneumonia patients(all P < 0.05). Higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration, and headache, lower lymphocytes, albumin, serum sodium levels and higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels and lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels and higher serum creatinine and radiograph score at admission were predictive factors for severe/critical subtype. Conclusion Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes.

One previous study reported a family cluster with asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. Here, we report another series of cases and further demonstrate the repeatability of the transmission of COVID-19 by pre-symptomatic carriers. Methods A familial cluster of five patients associated with COVID-19 was enrolled in the hospital. We collected epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory outcomes from electronic medical records, and also affirmed them with the patients and their families. Results Among them, three family members (Case 3/4/5) had returned from Wuhan. Additionally, two family members, those who had not travelled to Wuhan, also contracted COVID-19 after contacting with the other three family members. Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Case 3 and Case 5 presented fever and cough on days 2 through 3 of hospitalization and had ground-glass opacity changes in their lungs. Case 4 presented with diarrhoea and pharyngalgia after admission without radiographic abnormalities. Case 2 presented no clinical or radiographic abnormalities. All the cases had an increasing level of C-reactive protein.

847,Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients,"Abstract Background There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. Methods We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. Results Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between two group (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. Conclusions Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence IgG antibody production.","Zheng, Changcheng; Wang, Jinquan; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Ma, Yan; Zhu, Yuyou; Xia, Daqing; Wang, Yinzhong; He, Hongliang; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Yong; Fei, Mingming; Yin, Yihong; Zheng, Mao; Xu, Yehong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27
848,Monitoring Transmissibility and Mortality of COVID-19 in Europe,"Abstract Objectives As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective was to report real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) case fatality rate (CFR). Methods Data were mainly obtained from WHO website, up to 9 March 2020. R(t) was estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time dependent (TD) methods. “R0” package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both naïve CFR (nCFR) and adjust CFR (aCFR) were estimated. Results In EG method, R(t) was 3.27 [3.17-3.38] for Italy, 6.32 [5.72-6.99] for France, 6.07 [5.51-6.69] for Germany, 5.08 [4.51-5.74] for Spain. With TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 [2.21-4.11] for Italy, 6.56 [2.04-12.26] for France, 4.43 [1.83-7.92] for Germany, and 3.95 [0-10.19] for Spain.

Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).

852,"High-resolution Chest CT Features and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China","Abstract Background A pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently emerged in China. It was recognized as a global health hazard. Methods 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded, and ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. Results Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P <0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P <0.05). Conclusions Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dai, Hui; Zhang, Xin; Xia, Jianguo; Zhang, Tao; Shang, Yalei; Huang, Renjun; Liu, Rongrong; Wang, Dan; Li, Min; Wu, Jinping; Xu, Qiuzhen; Li, Yonggang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.003,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

860,Predicting the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) utilizing capability as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified human coronavirus causing severe pneumonia pandemic, was probably originated from Chinese horseshoe bats. However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiu, Ye; Zhao, Yuan-Bo; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Liao, Ce-Heng; Ge, Xing-Yi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19

863,Establishment of method for dual simultaneous detection of PEDV and TGEV by combination of magnetic micro-particles and nanoparticles,"Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are the main pathogens causing viral diarrhea in pig, mixed infections of these two viruses are very common in intensive pig rearing. However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect.","Luo, Le; Chen, Jing; Li, Xiaomin; Qiao, Dan; Wang, Zhenyu; Wu, Xingchen; Du, Qian; Tong, Dewen; Huang, Yong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiac.2020.01.008,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05

869,Viroporins and inflammasomes: A key to understand virus-induced inflammation,"Abstract Viroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1β was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1β is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1β, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K+, H+ and Ca2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes.","Farag, N.S.; Breitinger, U.; Breitinger, H.G.; El Azizi, M.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738,Elsevier,10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105738,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

871,Viral replicons as valuable tools for drug discovery,"RNA viruses can cause severe diseases such as dengue, Lassa, chikungunya and Ebola. Many of these viruses can only be propagated under high containment levels, necessitating the development of low containment surrogate systems such as subgenomic replicons and minigenome systems. Replicons are self-amplifying recombinant RNA molecules expressing proteins sufficient for their own replication but which do not produce infectious virions. Replicons can persist in cells and are passed on during cell division, enabling quick, efficient and high-throughput testing of drug candidates that act on viral transcription, translation and replication. This review will explore the history and potential for drug discovery of hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and norovirus replicon and minigenome systems.","Hannemann, Holger",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.drudis.2020.03.010,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
872,Bioenergy in China: Evaluation of domestic biomass resources and the associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials,"Abstract As bioenergy produces neutral or even negative carbon emissions, the assessment of biomass resources and associated emissions mitigation is a key step toward a low carbon future. However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (−26.6%, 39.7%) and (−27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020–2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73–5859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78–1344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China's untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change.","Kang, Yating; Yang, Qing; Bartocci, Pietro; Wei, Hongjian; Liu, Sylvia Shuhan; Wu, Zhujuan; Zhou, Hewen; Yang, Haiping; Fantozzi, Francesco; Chen, Hanping",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

875,Predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on global supply chains: A simulation-based analysis on the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) case,"Abstract Epidemic outbreaks are a special case of supply chain (SC) risks which is distinctively characterized by a long-term disruption existence, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and high uncertainty. We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model’s behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.","Ivanov, Dmitry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

877,The COVID-19 pandemic: Important considerations for contact lens practitioners,"Abstract A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).","Jones, Lyndon; Walsh, Karen; Willcox, Mark; Morgan, Philip; Nichols, Jason",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

881,Head and neck oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Reconsidering traditional treatment paradigms in light of new surgical and other multilevel risks,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms. Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: 1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; 2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; 3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; 4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; 5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient. Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.","Day, Andrew T.; Sher, David J.; Lee, Rebecca C.; Truelson, John M.; Myers, Larry L.; Sumer, Baran D.; Stankova, Lenka; Tillman, Brittny N.; Hughes, Randall S.; Khan, Saad A.; Gordin, Eli A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104684,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104684,Elsevier,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104684,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

889,"Invasive alien plant species: Their impact on environment, ecosystem services and human health","Abstract Ecological perturbations caused by biotic invasion have been identified as a growing threat to global sustainability. Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.","Kumar Rai, Prabhat; Singh, J.S.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

898,Improving vaccine-induced immunity: Can Baseline Predict Outcome?,"Abstract Immune signatures measured at baseline and immediately prior to vaccination, may predict the immune response to vaccination. Such pre-vaccine assessment might allow not only population-based, but also more personalized vaccination strategies (‘precision vaccination’). If baseline immune signatures are predictive, the underlying mechanism they reflect may also determine vaccination outcome. Thus, baseline signatures might contribute to identifying interventional targets to be modulated prior to vaccination in order to improve vaccination responses. This concept has the potential to transform vaccination strategies and usher in a new approach to improve global health.","Tsang, John S.; Dobaño, Carlota; VanDamme, Pierre; Moncunill, Gemma; Marchant, Arnaud; Othman, Rym Ben; Sadarangani, Manish; Koff, Wayne; Kollmann, Tobias R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.it.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
899,"COVID-19: Epidemiology, Evolution, and Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan turned into a public health emergency of international concern. With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.","Sun, Jiumeng; He, Wan-Ting; Wang, Lifang; Lai, Alexander; Ji, Xiang; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Li, Gairu; Suchard, Marc A.; Tian, Jin; Zhou, Jiyong; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008,21/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-21

901,After corona: there is life after the pandemic,"Abstract The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has focused the attention of medical-care providers away from non-life-threatening diseases, including infertility. Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life. Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are age-dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do not transmit COVID-19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.","Tesarik, Jan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.002,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
902,COVID-19 and ART: the view of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global situation. As ART specialists we should be cautious, carefully monitoring the situation whilst contributing by sharing novel evidence to counsel our patients, both pregnant women and would-be mothers. Time to egg collection and drop-out rates are parameters critical to scheduling treatments once the curve of infections has peaked and plateaued in each country. In order to reduce both parameters, infertile patients now require even more support from their IVF team: urgent oocyte collection for oncologic patients must be guaranteed, and oocyte retrievals for women of advanced maternal age and/or reduced ovarian reserve cannot be postponed indefinitely. This document represents the position of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine (SIFES-MR) in outlining ART priorities during and after this emergency.","Vaiarelli, Alberto; Bulletti, Carlo; Cimadomo, Danilo; Borini, Andrea; Alviggi, Carlo; Ajossa, Silvia; Anserini, Paola; Gennarelli, Gianluca; Guido, Maurizio; Levi-Setti, Paolo Emanuele; Palagiano, Antonio; Palermo, Roberto; Savasi, Valeria; Pellicer, Antonio; Rienzi, Laura; Ubaldi, Filippo Maria",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.04.003,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
903,Disease X: accelerating the development of medical countermeasures for the next pandemic,"Summary WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no, or insufficient, medical countermeasures. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X, an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease, but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing, which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally, we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile, to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development, to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View, we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream, intended for a broad audience including academia, medical countermeasure developers, and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design, chemistry, manufacturing and control activities, and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures. We intend to cover these topics in future publications.","Simpson, Shmona; Kaufmann, Michael C; Glozman, Vitaly; Chakrabarti, Ajoy",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,Elsevier,10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30123-7,17/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-17

905,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Summary Background Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. Methods We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R 0] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R 0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. Findings For the baseline scenario, when R 0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000–320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000–776 000) when R 0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000–1 249 000) when R 0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R 0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R 0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 −94·4) when R 0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R 0 of 1·5. Interpretation Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

906,"Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study","Summary Background In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. Findings Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29–34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. Interpretation The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

912,Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study,"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. Findings Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95% CI −0·19 to −0·11; R 2=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R 2>0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. Interpretation Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.

913,"Clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhejiang, China: an observational cohort study","Summary Background Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. Little is known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients' epidemiological and clinical features. Findings From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured. Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

914,Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series,"Summary Background On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. Methods In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. Findings The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. Interpretation We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

918,"Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China","Summary Background The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. Findings The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22–64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5–4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22–67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18–68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0–42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. Interpretation Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

919,"Evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei province, China: a descriptive and modelling study","Summary Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R t) at the provincial level. Findings We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33–56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0–14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0–9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8–12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3–11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74–1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32–2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. Interpretation Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

926,Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis,"Summary Background In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. Findings Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged <60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–7·6) in those aged 80 years or older. Interpretation These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

Method We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. Results Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. Conclusion Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.","Amrane, Sophie; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Doudier, Barbara; Eldin, Carole; Hocquart, Marie; Mailhe, Morgane; Dudouet, Pierre; Ormières, Etienne; Ailhaud, Lucie; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Brouqui, Philippe; Zandotti, Christine; Ninove, Laetitia; Luciani, Léa; Boschi, Céline; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier; Million, Matthieu; Colson, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101632,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and Mandarin languages. Methods YouTube was searched using the terms ‘2019 novel coronavirus’, ‘Wuhan virus’ and ‘武汉病毒’ (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. Results These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). Conclusions YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal International health agencies are underrepresented.

So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no “specific drug” available. Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” has become a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”. China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus. Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.","Cao, Yu-chen; Deng, Qi-xin; Dai, Shi-xue",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101647,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Here, we report the main clinical findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia. Methods For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group. Conclusions This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation. Preparedness for a significant epidemic, as is going on in other countries, and the deployment of response plans for it, in the country is now taking place to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population.","Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo; Lizon-Ferrufino, Nicolas Freddy; Maldonado-Alanoca, Americo; Alarcón-De-la-Vega, Gricel; Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena; Balderrama-Saavedra, María Alejandra; Bonilla-Aldana, D.

967,"Epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus in Jiangsu Province, China after wartime control measures: A population-level retrospective study","Abstract Background A novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, and human-to-human transmission was previously identified. This study aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics in Jiangsu Province and assess whether so-called wartime control measures changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province. Methods Epidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020. Results The cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases. The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%–58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined. The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou. The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people). The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province. The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases. Conclusion The number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined. This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.","Wang, Ke-wei; Gao, Jie; Wang, Hua; Wu, Xiao-long; Yuan, Qin-fang; Guo, Fei-yu; Zhang, Zhi-jie; Cheng, Yang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101654,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05

In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. Results: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5‰ (95% CI: 0.31‰–4.37‰).

The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.","Han, Yuanyuan; Jiang, Mao; Xia, Da; He, Lichao; Lv, Xin; Liao, Xiaohua; Meng, Jie",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108413,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108413,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108413,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
975,Individual risk management strategy and potential therapeutic options for the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract It is an ugly fact that a significant amount of the world's population will contract SARS-CoV infection with the current spreading. While specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death. The careful individual assessment for the possible dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.","Gasmi, Amin; Noor, Sadaf; Tippairote, Torsak; Dadar, Maryam; Menzel, Alain; Bjørklund, Geir",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108409,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108409,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108409,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

977,Epigenetic dysregulation of ACE2 and interferon-regulated genes might suggest increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in lupus patients,"Abstract Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","Sawalha, Amr H.; Zhao, Ming; Coit, Patrick; Lu, Qianjin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clim.2020.108410,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapted a colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higher throughput.","Park, Gun-Soo; Ku, Keunbon; Baek, Seung-Hwa; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kim, Seung Il; Kim, Bum-Tae; Maeng, Jin-Soo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmoldx.2020.03.006,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

986,"Diarrhea during COVID-19 infection: pathogenesis, epidemiology, prevention and management","Abstract Background and aims The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency. An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. Methods We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Conclusion Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.","D’Amico, Ferdinando; Baumgart, Daniel C.; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.001,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

988,COVID-19 Computed Tomography Findings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Abstract Purpose To date, there remain considerable knowledge gaps regarding the chest CT imaging features of COVID-19. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantitatively summarize results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. Methods Studies were identiﬁed by searching PubMed database for articles published December 2019 – February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. Results A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (GGO) (83.31%), GGO with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%) and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%) and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had 3 or more lobes involved (70.81%). Conclusions The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included GGO and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

994,"SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes","Abstract Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic. In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome. Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs. We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.","Wu, Cheng-I.; Postema, Pieter G.; Arbelo, Elena; Behr, Elijah R.; Bezzina, Connie R.; Napolitano, Carlo; Robyns, Tomas; Probst, Vincent; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Remme, Carol Ann; Wilde, Arthur A.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,Elsevier,10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.03.024,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected. For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1), the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. These differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean and that Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy.","Amariles, Pedro; Granados, Johan; Ceballos, Mauricio; Montoya, Carlos Julio",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.013,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
1002,On the frontline against COVID-19: Community pharmacists’ contribution during a public health crisis,"Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare services. In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies and policy makers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19.","Cadogan, Cathal A.; Hughes, Carmel M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.03.015,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1006,Drugs supply and pharmaceutical care management practices at a designated hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Abstract The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected at the end of December 2019. The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees. As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients. According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19. Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally. The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

We compare the new spread characteristics of COVID-19 with those of SARS and MERS. By considering the growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases, their propagation growth model is established. The parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models are obtained by nonlinear fitting. Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention. The infection inhibition constant in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, which reasonably explains the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei.","Liang, Kaihao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306,Elsevier,10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104306,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08
1016,The role of chemokines and chemokine receptors in multiple sclerosis,"Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by leukocyte infiltration and subsequent axonal damage, demyelinating inflammation, and formation of sclerosing plaques in brain tissue. The results of various studies in patients indicate that autoimmunity and inflammation make an important impact on the pathogenesis of MS. Chemokines are key mediators of inflammation development and cell migration, mediating various immune cell responses, including chemotaxis and immune activation, and are important in immunity and inflammation, therefore we focus on chemokines and their receptors in multiple sclerosis. In this article, we summarize the study of the role of prominent chemokines and their receptors in MS patients and MS animal modelsand discuss their potential significance in inflammatory injury and repair of MS. We have also summarized the progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis antagonists in recent years with chemokine receptors as targets.","Cui, Li-Yuan; Chu, Shi-Feng; Chen, Nai-Hong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106314,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106314,Elsevier,10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106314,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results.

Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease. COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19.

1026,Haploidentical bone marrow transplant with posttransplant cyclophosphamide for sickle cell disease: An update,"Abstract Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential.

How to face this new coronavirus epidemic outbreak is an important issue. Basic reproduction number (R0) is an important parameter in epidemiology; The basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Epidemiology dynamics is a mathematical model based on a susceptibility-infection-recovery epidemic model. Researchers analyzed the epidemiological benefits of different transmission rates for the establishment of effective strategy in prevention and control strategies for epidemic infectious diseases. In this review, the early use of TCM for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal. Many TCM formulas and products have wide application in treating infectious and non-infectious diseases. The TCM theoretical system of treating epidemic diseases with TCM and the treatment scheme of integrated Chinese and Western medicine have proved their effectiveness in clinical practice.

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. Methods Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. Results Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens. In general, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in non- COVID-19 endemic area during the flu season. Since all patients shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, expanded surveillance of detailed exposure history for suspected patients and application of rapid detection tools are highly recommended.","Hsih, Wen-Hsin; Cheng, Meng-Yu; Ho, Mao-Wang; Chou, Chia-Huei; Lin, Po-Chang; Chi, Chih-Yu; Liao, Wei-Chih; Chen, Chih-Yu; Leong, Lih-Ying; Tien, Ni; Lai, Huan-Cheng; Lai, Yi-Chyi; Lu, Min-Chi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.008,13/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-13
1031,Do children need a longer time to shed SARS-CoV-2 in stool than adults?,Abstract SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the stool of patients in the recovery phase.

1032,Internationally lost COVID-19 cases,"Abstract Background With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. Methods We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. Results While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p < 0.01). Conclusions Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14

Methods From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. Results Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","Xing, Yu-Han; Ni, Wei; Wu, Qin; Li, Wen-Jie; Li, Guo-Ju; Wang, Wen-Di; Tong, Jian-Ning; Song, Xiu-Feng; Wing-Kin Wong, Gary; Xing, Quan-Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.021,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
1038,Genotype and phenotype of COVID-19: Their roles in pathogenesis,"Abstract COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and then pandemic. Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing single-stranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 3′-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.","Mousavizadeh, Leila; Ghasemi, Sorayya",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.022,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Most of the affected peoples had reached India from different part of the world, as like of carrier. Owing to this, India made several precautionary measures to mitigate/neglect the disease in beginning stage, however, the denser population of country will not be simple to control the same for long time (community spread), if government will not incorporate the visionary strategies. Since attacked several nations have been worried mostly for their people life (health), despite that developing country like India with huge population should consider about the livelihood (for Below Poverty Line (BPL) people), equally with the life.

1041,The association between international and domestic air traffic and the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,"Abstract Background The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. Methods and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. Results Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r2=0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r2=0.98, p<0.01). Conclusions The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Zacharksi, Maciej; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026,28/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-28
1042,Treatment options for COVID-19: the reality and challenges,"Abstract An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.","Jean, Shio-Shin; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, mounting evidence indicates that patients might also report extra-pulmonary manifestations, including those affecting the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This involvement may have important implications to the disease management, transmission, and prognosis, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic or digestive co-morbidities. In this review, the characteristics and possible explanations of hepatic and gastrointestinal involvement caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized, adding to our knowledge of the spectrum of COVID-19.

1052,Viral infections and multiple sclerosis,"The etiology and pathogenesis of MS is likely to involve multiple factors interacting with each other, and the role of infectious and viral agents is still under debate, however a consistent amount of studies suggests that some viruses are associated with the disease. The strongest documentation has come from the detection of viral nucleic acid or antigen or of an anti-viral antibody response in MS patients. A further step for the study of the mechanism viruses might be involved in can be made using in vitro and in vivo models. While in vitro models, based on glial and neural cell lines from various sources are widely used, in vivo animal models present challenges. Indeed neurotropic animal viruses are currently used to study demyelination in well-established models, but animal models of demyelination by human virus infection have only recently been developed, using animal gammaherpesviruses closely related to Epstein Barr virus (EBV), or using marmosets expressing the specific viral receptor for Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The present review will illustrate the main potential mechanisms of MS pathogenesis possibly associated with viral infections and viruses currently used to study demyelination in animal models. Then the viruses most strongly linked with MS will be discussed, in the perspective that more than one virus might have a role, with varying degrees of interaction, contributing to MS heterogeneity.","Donati, Donatella",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ddmod.2020.02.003,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01
1053,Advancements in Prophylactic and Therapeutic Nanovaccines,"Abstract Vaccines activate suitable immune responses to fight against diseases but can possess limitations such as compromised efficacy and immunogenic responses, poor stability, and requirement of adherence to multiple doses. ‘Nanovaccines’ have been explored to elicit a strong immune response with the advantages of nano-sized range, high antigen loading, enhanced immunogenicity, controlled antigen presentation, more retention in lymph nodes and promote patient compliance by a lower frequency of dosing. Various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines have the potential to induce both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity and can render long-lasting immunogenic memory. With such properties, nanovaccines have shown high potential for the prevention of infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Their therapeutic potential has also been explored in the treatment of cancer. The various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development, their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. Statement of significance Interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system has opened multiple avenues to combat a variety of infectious and non-infectious pathological conditions. Limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. This review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines. The applications of nanovaccines in infectious and non-infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, influenza, and cancers have been discussed. It will help the readers develop an understanding of mechanisms of immune activation by nanovaccines and design appropriate strategies for novel nanovaccines.","Bhardwaj, Prateek; Bhatia, Eshant; Sharma, Shivam; Ahamad, Nadim; Banerjee, Rinti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,Elsevier,10.1016/j.actbio.2020.03.020,05/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-05

In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. Aims and methods We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. Results Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs. Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Akriti; Shaikh, Altamash; Singh, Ritu; Misra, Anoop",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.011,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
1066,Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5–6 weeks,"Abstract Introduction and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. Material and methods Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. Results A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. Conclusion According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.","Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,Elsevier,10.1016/j.dsx.2020.03.017,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

1072,"Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in healthy adults in western Saudi Arabia, 2011–2016","Abstract Background The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized zoonotic coronavirus. Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. Methods Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. Results Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0–2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1–0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15–44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. Conclusions An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.","Degnah, Afnan A.; Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S.; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Mirza, Ahmed A.; Hindawi, Salwa I.; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I.; Hashem, Anwar M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.001,28/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-28
1073,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated stress among medical students at a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Background and objectives Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students’ perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1–10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. Conclusions Medical students’ psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A.; Hasan, Gamal M.; Al-Zamil, Fahad; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Alsohime, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Saadi, Basma; Somily, Ali Mohammed",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005,27/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-27
1074,"Enhanced surveillance and response approaches for pilgrims and local Saudi populations against emerging Nipah, Zika and Ebola viral diseases outbreaks threats","Summary Increasing emergence and spread of Nipah, ZIKV and Ebola case and potential outbreaks threats have been reported in several regions around the globe. Yet, emerging Nipah, Ebola and Zika viral diseases outbreaks have been indirectly linked to substantially globalization of trade and travel, climate change and intense urbanization impact, healthcare and socioeconomic inequities as well in affected community settings. Although no case has been documented in Saudi Arabia, there is a great risk of sudden emergence of any of these viruses and others via introducing among pilgrims coming from endemic regions during ritual ceremonies of mass gatherings. Consequently, promoting and investing on new and sensitive proven effective and innovative surveillance and monitoring approaches, including enhanced risk communication, improved integrated vectors surveillance in addition to improved sustainable highly pathogens surveillance control programs to human motility and environmental sanitation strategies all represent ‘One Health’ approach implementation strategic core. Initiation, development and implementation leaded by Saudi government and international stakeholders’ of new partnership, coordinated response leadership and resource mobilization for multidisciplinary and intersectorial advocacy on emerging viral disease outbreaks, accompanied with R&D roadmap and taskforce is crucial. More efforts in epidemiological and laboratory early screening and surveillance of highly pathogenic germs/microbes, and confirmation of asymptomatic and syndromic cases amongst suspected Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, local vulnerable populations and expatriate workers is vital in generating reliable data and data sharing platform for timely risk communication and tourist information update, appropriate immunization campaigns or safe and efficacious care delivery implementation. Moreover, increase Hajj/Umrah mass gathering emergency outbreak preparedness, pilgrims health education and engagement outreach, pre-, during and post programs coverage and effectiveness is needed through One Health approach integration in attaining pilgrims and local population health safety and security, in advancing Saudi sustainable health development goals.","Tambo, Ernest; El-Dessouky, Ashraf G.; Khater, Emad I.M.; Xianonng, Zhou",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.313,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Roy, Deblina; Tripathy, Sarvodaya; Kar, Sujita Kumar; Sharma, Nivedita; Verma, Sudhir Kumar; Kaushal, Vikas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102083,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102083,08/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-08

1089,Highlights of traditional Chinese medicine frontline expert advice in the China national guideline for COVID-19,"Abstract Introduction The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold. As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease. To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese–Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline. Methods The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19. We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world. Results We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline. TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients’ disease status. Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases. Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses. Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases. Conclusion To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures. Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines. Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.","Ho, Leonard T.F.; Chan, Karina K.H.; Chung, Vincent C.H.; Leung, Ting Hung",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101116,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

Such dynamic behavior of IDPs earned the name “Dancing Proteins.” The exploration of these dancing proteins in viruses has just started and crucial details such as correlation of rapid evolution, high rate of mutation and accumulation of disordered contents in viral proteome at least understood partially. In order to gain a complete understanding of this correlation, there is a need to decipher the complexity of viral mediated cell hijacking and pathogenesis in the host organism. Further there is necessity to identify the specific patterns within viral and host IDPs such as aggregation; Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) and their association to virulence, host range and rate of evolution of viruses in order to tackle the viral-mediated diseases. The current book chapter summarizes the aforementioned details and suggests the novel opportunities for further research of IDPs senses in viruses.","Mishra, Pushpendra Mani; Verma, Navneet Chandra; Rao, Chethana; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Nandi, Chayan Kanti",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.03.001,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02
1092,Stratégie pour la pratique de la chirurgie digestive et oncologique en situation d’épidémie de COVID-19,"Résumé La pandémie due au COVID-19 modifie l’organisation des soins et change la réalisation de la chirurgie digestive. Les priorités sanitaires et les circuits de soins sont modifiés. La chirurgie d’urgence reste prioritaire. Les interventions pour chirurgie fonctionnelles sont à reporter. La chirurgie par laparoscopie doit suivre des règles strictes pour ne pas exposer les professionnels à un surrisque. Le questionnement principal concerne la chirurgie oncologique, opérer ou reporter ? Il existe probablement un sur risque opératoire induit par la pandémie qui doit être mis en balance avec le retard de prise en charge chirurgical. Pour chaque type de cancer, colon, pancréas, œsogastrique, hépatocarcinome, la morbi-mortalité est rappelée et mise en parallèle avec le risque oncologique lié au retard à la chirurgie et/ou au temps de doublement de la tumeur. Cette comparaison permet de proposer des stratégies, ainsi pour les cancers coliques (T1-2, N0), il est souhaitable de retarder la chirurgie. Pour les lésions coliques avancées, il semble prudent de recommander une chimiothérapie néo adjuvante et d’attendre. Pour les cancers du rectum T3-4 et/ou N+, une radio-chimiothérapie est indiquée, une radiothérapie courte devra être discutée (suivie d’une période d’attente) afin de réduire le temps d’exposition à l’hôpital et d’éviter les infections. La majorité des chirurgies complexes à forte morbi-mortalité, œsogastrique, hépatique ou pancréatique doivent sans doute le plus souvent être reportée. Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery – go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer – colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma – morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3–4 and /or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality – oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic – is most often best deferred.","Tuech, J.-J.; Gangloff, A.; Di Fiore, F.; Michel, P.; Brigand, C.; Slim, K.; Pocard, M.; Schwarz, L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.03.007,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1105,Infection and Rapid Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Ferrets,"Summary The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority. We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs. Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.","Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Eun-Ha; Park, Su-Jin; Yu, Kwang-Min; Chang, Jae-Hyung; Kim, Eun Ji; Lee, Seunghun; Casel, Mark Anthony B.; Um, Jihye; Song, Min-Suk; Jeong, Hye Won; Lai, Van Dam; Kim, Yeonjae; Chin, Bum Sik; Park, Jun-Sun; Chung, Ki-Hyun; Foo, Suan-Sin; Poo, Haryoung; Mo, In-Pil; Lee, Ok-Jun; Webby, Richard J.; Jung, Jae U.; Choi, Young Ki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.023,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
1106,Next-generation direct-acting influenza therapeutics,"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.","Toots, Mart; Plemper, Richard K.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.trsl.2020.01.005,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04

Due to the restrictions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined. Methods We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education. Results We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time. Conclusions These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.","Chick, Robert Connor; Clifton, Guy Travis; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Propper, Brandon W.; Hale, Diane F.; Alseidi, Adnan A.; Vreeland, Timothy J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03

1111,Triage Considerations for Patients Referred for Structural Heart Disease Intervention During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An ACC /SCAI Consensus Statement,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care resources around the world causing many institutions to curtail or stop elective procedures. This has resulted in the inability to care for patients valvular and structural heart disease (SHD) in a timely fashion potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications including congestive heart failure and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic versus the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, we suggest guidelines as to how to triage patients in need of SHD interventions and provide a framework of how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, we address the triage of patients in need of trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair. We also address procedural issues and considerations for the function of structural heart disease teams during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Pinak B.; Welt, Frederick G.P.; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Phillips, Alistair; Kleiman, Neal S.; Young, Michael N.; Sherwood, Matthew; Batchelor, Wayne; Wang, Dee Dee; Davidson, Laura; Wyman, Janet; Kadavath, Sabeeda; Szerlip, Molly; Hermiller, James; Fullerton, David; Anwaruddin, Saif",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcin.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcin.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcin.2020.04.001,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

1113,The involvement of regulated cell death forms in modulating the bacterial and viral pathogenesis,"Abstract Apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis represent three distinct types of regulated cell death forms, which play significant roles in response to viral and bacterial infections. Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host.

1117,Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model,"Abstract The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1,000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.","Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,Elsevier,10.1016/j.csbj.2020.03.025,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30

The number of deaths reached 12,>784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%. Children are population least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers’ ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed. Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Abduljali, J.M.; Abduljali, B.M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100672,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100672,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100672,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1126,Polysaccharide-based chromatographic adsorbents for virus purification and viral clearance,"Abstract Viruses still represent a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. In the fight against viral infections, high-purity viral stocks are needed for manufacture of safer vaccines. It is also a priority to ensure the viral safety of biopharmaceuticals such as blood products. Chromatography techniques are widely implemented at both academic and industrial levels in the purification of viral particles, whole viruses and virus-like particles, and to remove viral contaminants from biopharmaceutical products. This paper focuses on polysaccharide adsorbents, particulate resins and membrane adsorbers, used in virus purification/removal chromatography processes. Different chromatographic modes are surveyed, with particular attention on ion exchange and affinity/pseudo-affinity adsorbents among which commercially available agarose-based resins (Sepharose®) and cellulose-based membrane adsorbers (Sartobind®) occupy a dominant position. Mainly built on the development of new ligands coupled to conventional agarose/cellulose matrices, the development perspectives of polysaccharide-based chromatography media in this antiviral area are stressed in a conclusive part.","Junter, Guy-Alain; Lebrun, Laurent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.01.002,13/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-13

The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.","ul Qamar, Muhammad Tahir; Alqahtani, Safar M.; Alamri, Mubarak A.; Chen, Ling-Ling",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.009,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26
1128,Recent advances and perspectives of nucleic acid detection for coronavirus,"Abstract The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Chinais posing a great threat to global public health. Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people’s lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.","Shen, Minzhe; Zhou, Ying; Ye, Jiawei; Abdullah AL-maskri, Abdu Ahmed; Kang, Yu; Zeng, Su; Cai, Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.02.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.02.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpha.2020.02.010,01/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-01

Whether this is due to relapse of the disease, reinfection by the virus, or a false-positive result at hospital discharge is worth exploring. Case presentation A woman with COVID-19 was discharged from the hospital after integrative treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine because she met the discharge standards. However, she obtained positive results on a nucleic acid test 22 days later.

1130,Importance of Viral Disease in Dairy Cow Fertility,"Abstract Many viral diseases are endemic in cattle populations worldwide. The ability of many viruses to cross the placenta and cause abortions and fetal malformations is well understood. There is also significant evidence that viral infections have additional actions in dairy cows, which are reflected in reduced conception rates. These effects are, however, highly dependent on the time at which an individual animal first contracts the disease and are less easy to quantify. This paper reviews the evidence relating to five viruses that can affect fertility, together with their potential mechanisms of action. Acute infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in mid-gestation increases abortion rates or causes the birth of persistently infected calves. BVDV infections closer to the time of breeding can have direct effects on the ovaries and uterine endometrium, which cause estrous cycle irregularities and early embryo mortality. Fertility may also be reduced by BVDV-induced immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. Bovine herpesvirus (BHV)-1 is most common in pre-pubertal heifers, and can slow their growth, delay breeding, and increase the age at first calving. Previously infected animals subsequently show reduced fertility. Although this may be associated with lung damage, ovarian lesions have also been reported. Both BHV-1 and BHV-4 remain latent in the host following initial infection and may be reactivated later by stress, for example associated with calving and early lactation. While BHV-4 infection alone may not reduce fertility, it appears to act as a co-factor with established bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes to promote the development of endometritis and delay uterine repair mechanisms after calving. Both Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) are transmitted by insect vectors and lead to increased abortion rates and congenital malformations. BTV-8 also impairs the development of hatched blastocysts; furthermore, infection around the time of breeding with either virus appears to reduce conception rates. Although the reductions in conception rates are often difficult to quantify, they are nevertheless sufficient to cause economic losses, which help to justify the benefits of vaccination and eradication schemes.","Wathes, D.

1131,Core Outcome Set for Clinical Trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COS-COVID),"Abstract Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated.","Jin, Xinyao; Pang, Bo; Zhang, Junhua; Liu, Qingquan; Yang, Zhongqi; Feng, Jihong; Liu, Xuezheng; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Baohe; Huang, Yuhong; Josephine Fauci, Alice; Ma, Yuling; Soo Lee, Myeong; Yuan, Wei'an; Xie, Yanming; Tang, Jianyuan; Gao, Rui; Du, Liang; Zhang, Shuo; Qi, Hanmei; Sun, Yu; Zheng, Wenke; Yang, Fengwen; Chua, Huizi; Wang, Keyi; Ou, Yi; Huang, Ming; Zhu, Yan; Yu, Jiajie; Tian, Jinhui; Zhao, Min; Hu, Jingqing; Yao, Chen; Li, Youping; Zhang, Boli",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

1133,Experimental Treatment with Favipiravir for COVID-19: An Open-Label Control Study,"Abstract An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in China since December 2019. More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%–2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2–14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1–14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5–9) d versus 11 (8–13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cai, Qingxian; Yang, Minghui; Liu, Dongjing; Chen, Jun; Shu, Dan; Xia, Junxia; Liao, Xuejiao; Gu, Yuanbo; Cai, Qiue; Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Xiaohe; Peng, Ling; Huang, Deliang; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Shurong; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Jiaye; Chen, Li; Chen, Shuyan; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhang, Zheng; Cao, Ruiyuan; Zhong, Wu; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007,18/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-18

1137,"Durable Survival Outcomes in Primary and Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphoma After High-dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Using a Thiotepa, Busulfan, and Cyclophosphamide Conditioning Regimen","Abstract Background High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been investigated in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with CNS involvement and has shown promising results. Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of 48 consecutive patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients), secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) (8 patients), or relapsed disease with CNS involvement (13 patients) from July 2006 to December 2017. Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). Results The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for patients with PCNSL in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%), respectively. On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P = .007 for PFS; P = .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively. The most common side effects were febrile neutropenia (89.6%; of which 66.7% had an infectious etiology identified), nausea/vomiting (85.4%), diarrhea (93.8%), mucositis (89.6%), and electrolyte abnormalities (89.6%). Four patients (8.3%) died of treatment-related overwhelming infection; of these patients, 3 had SCNSL. Conclusion HDC and ASCT using TBC conditioning for both PCNSL and secondary CNS NHL appears to have encouraging long-term efficacy with manageable side effects.","Young, Patricia A.; Gaut, Daria; Kimaiyo, Davis K.; Grotts, Jonathan; Romero, Tahmineh; Chute, John; Schiller, Gary; de Vos, Sven; Eradat, Herbert A.; Timmerman, John",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.009,20/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-20
1138,Experimental models of demyelination and remyelination,"Abstract Introduction Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.A.; Gómez-Pinedo, U.; Matías-Guiu, J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.03.007,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29

1146,Assessing factors critical to smart technology applications to mobile health care − the fgm-fahp approach,"Abstract Smart technologies present numerous opportunities for enhancing mobile health care. However, some concerns regarding the viability of smart technology applications must be addressed. This study investigated these concerns by reviewing the current practices of smart technology applications to mobile health care. As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively. In addition, the challenges involved and opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of existing applications are discussed.","Chen, Toly",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.02.005,15/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-15
1147,Insurance uptake among small and medium-sized tourism and hospitality enterprises in a resource-scarce environment,"Abstract Small and medium-sized tourism and hospitality enterprises (SMTHEs) are often susceptible to various hazards, which result in risk concerns. Insurance is recognised as one of the risk management strategies, but evidence indicates that insurance uptake among SMTHEs has been low. Yet, researchers have hardly researched into the factors that influence insurance uptake among SMTHEs. Two-hundred and fifty (250) respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique. Confirmatory factor analysis, multivariate logit and probit regression techniques were used to determine factors underlying SMTHEs' insurance uptake. Risk concerns, the firm's characteristics, the perceived benefits of insurance and other informal risk coping mechanisms, as well as insurance service provision concerns were identified as determinants of insurance uptake. This is one of the first papers to offer a holistic understanding of the factors influencing SMTHEs' insurance subscription in a resource-scarce destination of Sub-Saharan Africa. The practical and theoretical implications of the paper are discussed.","Dayour, Frederick; Adongo, Charles A.; Kimbu, Albert N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmp.2020.100674,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

1149,Responding to natural disasters vs. disease outbreaks: Do emergency medical service providers have different views?,"Abstract Introduction Our planet has been experiencing a huge burden of natural disasters and public health emergencies in the last three decades. Emergency medical service providers are expected to be in the frontlines during such emergencies. Yet, this system is badly understudied when it comes to its roles and performance during disasters and public health emergencies. This study is designed to enhance understanding by assessing a sample U.S EMS providers’ views about working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks and explores whether they are coming to work during such conditions. Methods This study utilized a qualitative approach using face-to-face interviews with EMS workers from the State of Delaware, USA. Participants were asked about their views, insights, and potential behavior of working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. Data collected were transcribed and coded using ATLAS.ti software to develop themes of the study using an inductive approach. Results Three themes were emerged from interviews regarding working during natural disasters; respondents expressed excitement, concern, or no real differences. For disease outbreaks, however, the two themes were concerned and no additional risk. While participants expressed varying concerns about working during disasters and pandemic conditions, everyone felt willing and obligated to come to work despite the perceived high risk for some of them to work in some conditions. Conclusion This study helps to provide the base upon which EMS, public health, and emergency management agencies can formulate actions that emerged from the views of EMS providers concerning work during disasters and public health emergencies.","Alwidyan, Mahmoud T.; Trainor, Joseph E.; Bissell, Richard A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101440,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
1150,"Relationships between disaster nursing competence, anticipatory disaster stress and motivation for disaster engagement","Abstract Nurses are the largest group of healthcare providers and are often the first line responders to a disaster event. Nurses' disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement. The results of the study add to the understanding of factors that correlate with nurses' motivation to participate in disaster events. By understanding these factors, the government and healthcare administrators can design disaster education plans and other strategies to improve Taiwanese nurses’ motivation to engage in disaster events.","Liou, Shwu-Ru; Liu, Hsiu-Chen; Tsai, Hsiu-Min; Chu, Tsui-Ping; Cheng, Ching-Yu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101545,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101545,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101545,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31
1151,"Inhibitory effects of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide on coronavirus HCoV-229E replication and cytokine production by primary cultures of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells","Abstract Background Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), one of the causes of the common cold, exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. Methods Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. Results Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2′2′-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Watanabe, Oshi; Nomura, Kazuhiro; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Momma, Haruki; Ichinose, Masakazu; Kawase, Tetsuaki",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.resinv.2019.12.005,21/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-21

1155,Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist,"Abstract The global spread of COVID-19 has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality and clinician wellbeing may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation (SMART) approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.","Bansal, Priya; Bingemann, Theresa A.; Greenhawt, Matthew; Mosnaim, Giselle; Nanda, Anil; Oppenheimer, John; Sharma, Hemant; Stukus, David; Shaker, Marcus",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1157,Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases,"Summary WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO. The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.","Ramanathan, Kollengode; Antognini, David; Combes, Alain; Paden, Matthew; Zakhary, Bishoy; Ogino, Mark; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel; Shekar, Kiran",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,Elsevier,10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30121-1,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20

Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.","Phua, Jason; Weng, Li; Ling, Lowell; Egi, Moritoki; Lim, Chae-Man; Divatia, Jigeeshu Vasishtha; Shrestha, Babu Raja; Arabi, Yaseen M; Ng, Jensen; Gomersall, Charles D; Nishimura, Masaji; Koh, Younsuck; Du, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30161-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30161-2,Elsevier,10.1016/s2213-2600(20)30161-2,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06

1170,The COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for the cytology laboratory,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites. The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause, have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures. Due to repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, healthcare and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19. This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens. It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees and pathologists. In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pambuccian, Stefan E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jasc.2020.03.001,26/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-26
1171,Chemical Engineering and Environmental Challenges Cyclic adsorption/reaction technologies: materials and process together!,"Abstract I start with a brief survey of paradigms in Chemical Engineering to highlight that in the early 70 s my thesis advisor P. Le Goff already mentioned the strong link of chemical processes with Environment, Energy and Economy (Market). Then I move to my vision of ChE today summarized in ChE = M2P2E (Molecular, Materials, Process and Product Engineering). I describe how I built a research lab centered around Cyclic Adsorption/Reaction Processes focusing in adsorption technologies to help solving environmental problems. I stress the basic concepts of adsorption processes and the need to use proper diffusion models for intraparticle mass transfer instead of pseudo first order or second order kinetic models. I also consider that adsorbent metrics should be linked to the process where the material is used: materials and processes together! In the last section I review some challenging areas where adsorption technologies are useful. Carbon Capture and Utilization involving Pressure Swing Adsorption to capture CO2 from flue gas in a pilot plant, 3D printed composite monoliths for Electric Swing Adsorption, and Utilization of CO2 to be transformed in methanol or Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) (Power-to-Gas concept). I also address the general topic “Processing of diluted aqueous solutions” with special attention for the development of Simulated Moving Bed coupled with Expanded Bed Adsorption. Finally the integrated process to produce high-added valued compounds (vanillin and syringaldehyde) from Kraft lignin is shown as an example of Lignin valorization in pulp mill biorefinery.","Rodrigues, Alírio E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jece.2020.103926,07/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-07

1173,Herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19: a rapid review of guidelines,"Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and has caused illness to many people worldwide. This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19. Methods We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. Results Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines. In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage. In the frequency analysis of herbs, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found to be the herb with the highest frequency of usage in the Chinese guidelines. Conclusion This review can be used as guidance for the traditional medicine treatment of COVID-19. Clinical evidence is needed in the future to evaluate the efficacy of traditional medicine.","Ang, Lin; Lee, Hye Won; Choi, Jun Yong; Zhang, Junhua; Lee, Myeong Soo",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,Elsevier,10.1016/j.imr.2020.100407,29/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-29

1176,Chinese herbal Huo-Gu Formula for treatment of steroid-associated osteonecrosis of femoral head: a 14-years follow-up of convalescent SARS patients,"Abstract Purpose The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the SARS outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of one year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV). Only five patients (also five hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.","Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jot.2020.03.014,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1188,First report of two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks by the novel genotypes ON‐1 and NA‐2 in a neonatal intensive care unit,"Abstract Objective Respiratory syncytial virus is a pathogen frequently involved in nosocomial outbreaks. Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON‐1 and NA‐2 in a neonatal intensive care unit in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. Results From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus‐A (ten and 14 with ON‐1 and NA‐2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON‐1 and NA‐2 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. Conclusions Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus. Resumo Objetivo O vírus sincicial respiratório é um patógeno frequentemente envolvido em surtos nosocomiais. Embora vários estudos tenham relatado tais surtos em unidades de terapia intensiva neonatal, os dados epidemiológicos moleculares são escassos. Neste artigo, descrevemos dois surtos consecutivos de vírus sincicial respiratório causados pelos genótipos ON‐1 e NA‐2 em uma unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal em São Paulo, Brasil. Métodos Uma busca prospectiva por vírus sincicial respiratório foi realizada após o diagnóstico do caso índice e outros quatro recém‐nascidos sintomáticos na unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal. Amostras de aspirado nasofaríngeo de todos os pacientes da unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal foram testadas para 17 vírus respiratórios com reação em cadeia da polimerase via transcriptase reversa em tempo real. A genotipagem realizada utilizando sequenciamento de nucleotídeos. Resultados De maio a agosto de 2013, foram detectados dois surtos diferentes na unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal. Vinte e quatro crianças foram infectadas com vírus sincicial respiratório‐A (10 e 14 com os genótipos ON‐1 e NA‐2, respectivamente). A média da idade dos lactentes era de 10 dias, o peso médio ao nascer foi de 1961g e a idade gestacional média de 33 semanas. Fatores de risco (doença cardíaca, doença pulmonar e prematuridade) estavam presentes em 80% e 85,7% dos bebês nos grupos ON‐1 e NA‐2, respectivamente. No total, 45,8% dos lactentes eram assintomáticos e 20,8% necessitaram de ventilação mecânica. Não foram detectadas coinfecções durante os surtos. Conclusões Bebês em unidade de terapia intensiva neonatal que desenvolvem sintomas respiratórios abruptos devem ser testados para vírus respiratórios, especialmente o vírus sincicial respiratório. Mesmo na ausência de sintomas graves, a detecção de vírus sincicial respiratório pode prevenir a transmissão nosocomial através de medidas de controle de infecção. Um melhor entendimento da epidemiologia molecular do vírus sincicial respiratório é essencial para o desenvolvimento de novas vacinas e drogas antivirais contra o vírus sincicial respiratório.","Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalhães, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpedp.2018.10.008,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
1189,Community‐acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management,"Abstract Objective To provide cutting‐edge information for the management of community‐acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. Data source A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community‐acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. Data synthesis In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community‐acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤ 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community‐acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X‐ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77‐98%) and 93% (90‐99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. Conclusions Distinct aspects of childhood community‐acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades. Resumo Objetivo Fornecer informações de ponta para o manejo de crianças menores de cinco anos com pneumonia adquirida na comunidade, com base nas evidências mais recentes publicadas na literatura. Fonte de dados Uma pesquisa abrangente foi feita no PubMed, com as expressões: “community‐acquired pneumonia” + “child” + “etiology” ou “diagnosis” ou “severity” ou “antibiotic”. Todos os artigos encontrados tiveram o título e o resumo lidos e os artigos que relatavam as evidências mais recentes sobre cada assunto foram identificados e recuperados para leitura completa. Síntese dos dados Na era das vacinas bacterianas conjugadas amplamente usadas e do uso difundido de técnicas de amplificação de ácidos nucléicos, os vírus respiratórios foram identificados como os agentes causadores mais frequentes de pneumonia adquirida na comunidade em pacientes com menos de cinco anos. A hipoxemia (saturação de oxigênio ≤ 96%) e o aumento do esforço respiratório são os sinais mais associados à pneumonia adquirida na comunidade. A sibilância detectada ao exame físico prediz de forma independente a infecção viral e o valor preditivo negativo (intervalo de confiança de 95%) da radiografia de tórax normal e a procalcitonina sérica < 0,25 ng/dL foi de 92% (77‐98%) e 93% (90‐99%), respectivamente. Incapacidade de beber e se alimentar, vomitar todo o alimento, convulsões, retração torácica subcostal, cianose central, letargia, aleteo nasal, estridor e saturação de oxigênio < 90% são preditores de óbito e podem ser usados como indicadores de hospitalização. Derrames pleurais moderados/grandes e infiltrados multilobulares são preditores de doença grave. A amoxicilina administrada por via oral é a opção de primeira linha para tratar pacientes ambulatoriais e a ampicilina ou penicilina cristalina G ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) são as opções de primeira linha para tratar pacientes hospitalizados. Conclusões Aspectos distintos da pneumonia adquirida na comunidade durante a infância mudaram durante as últimas três décadas.","Nascimento‐Carvalho, Cristiana M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
1190,Wildlife trade shifts from brick-and-mortar markets to virtual marketplaces: A case study of birds of prey trade in Thailand,"Abstract The shift of wildlife trade from brick-and-mortar markets to virtual online marketplaces is reported using the trade of birds of prey (raptors) in Thailand from 1968 to 2019 as a case study. We analyzed data obtained from physical market survey data for 2,782 individuals from 27 species, with 2,420 individuals reported in early surveys (1968-1988) and 362 individuals reported in later surveys (2003-2015) and online surveys (February 2017 to January 2019). We compared information on asking prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and Internet era). In comparison to the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing physical birds market and online markets. In all datasets biological factors such as wingspan were significant factors in explaining price variation. We conclude that sustained monitoring is needed to make direct comparisons between the trade platforms. With a continued increase of wildlife trade on online platforms, we recommend increased regulation and enforcement of wildlife trade laws.","Siriwat, Penthai; Nijman, Vincent",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,Elsevier,10.1016/j.japb.2020.03.012,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25
1191,Optimization of 5′ untranslated region of modified mRNA for use in cardiac or hepatic ischemic injury,"Abstract Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a gene delivery platform for transiently introducing single or several gene/s of interest to different cell types and tissues. modRNA consider to be a safe vector for gene transfer as it negligibly activate the innate immune system and dose not compromise the genome integrity. The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post single delivery. Here, we identified that 5′UTR from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d) enhanced the translation of Luc modRNA by 2 fold in the heart post MI. Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation, and leads to a 2.5 fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5’UTR, post MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5′UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury. Indicating that Ces1d 5’UTR and Element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under ischemic condition.","Sultana, Nishat; Hadas, Yoav; Kabir Sharkar, Mohammad Tofael; Kaur, Keerat; Magadum, Ajit; Kurian, Ann Anu; Hossain, Nadia; Alburquerque, Bremy; Ahmed, Sakib; Chepurko, Elena; Zangi, Lior",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.omtm.2020.03.019,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. Interview data were analyzed by category analysis from the perspective of the existence, relatedness, and growth theory (ERG). Results The existence needs were mainly reflected in health and security needs, whereas the relatedness needs consisted mainly of interpersonal needs, humanistic concern needs, and family needs; further, the growth needs were mainly reflected as a strong need for knowledge. Existence needs were the main needs during the epidemic, with health and security needs influencing each other. Humanistic concern needs were the most important of the relatedness needs; interpersonal and family needs were also growing. Conclusion It is found that the existence, relatedness, and growth needs coexist in clinical nurses. It is helpful to take effective interventions to meet their needs if the needs of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients could be perceived well.","Yin, Xue; Zeng, Lingdan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2020.04.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2020.04.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijnss.2020.04.002,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1206,How virus size and attachment parameters affect the temperature sensitivity of virus binding to host cells: Predictions of a thermodynamic model for arboviruses and HIV,"Abstract Virus binding to host cells involves specific interactions between viral (glyco)proteins (GP) and host cell surface receptors (Cr) (protein or sialic acid (SA)). The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (ΔCp = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (ΔCp = −5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of ΔCp from 0 to ~−2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of ΔCp of ~−3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20 °C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of ΔCp greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ~20 °C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from ΔCp ~ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts. Large negative values of ΔCp as for HIV gp120:CD4 diminish binding at 37 °C. Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (ΔSa_immob) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. ΔSa_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. ΔSa_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative ΔSa_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0 °C to 40 °C in the case of dsDNA viruses. Compared to arboviruses which also infect warm-blooded vertebrates, HIV is large at 134 nm diameter and thus would have a large negative ΔSa_immob which would diminish its binding at human body temperature. It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment factors takes much of the entropy loss for ΔSa_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37 °C. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making ΔSa_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37 °C.","Gale, Paul",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mran.2020.100104,12/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-12
1207,Microneedle array delivered recombinant coronavirus vaccines: Immunogenicity and rapid translational development,"Abstract Background Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, Eun; Erdos, Geza; Huang, Shaohua; Kenniston, Thomas W.; Balmert, Stephen C.; Carey, Cara Donahue; Raj, V.

1209,School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,"Summary In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18, 2020. It is unknown whether school measures are effective in coronavirus outbreaks (eg, due to severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19). We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks. We included 16 of 616 identified articles. School closures were deployed rapidly across mainland China and Hong Kong for COVID-19. However, there are no data on the relative contribution of school closures to transmission control. Data from the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore suggest that school closures did not contribute to the control of the epidemic. Modelling studies of SARS produced conflicting results. Recent modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2–4% of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions.

1214,The practical need to challenge the status quo: New directions in bioethics,"Abstract Those of us working in bioethics field take it for granted that the rest of the world reads our work and uses it as part of their scholarship and reasoning processes. Having widespread national and international influence is true for some of the biggest name bioethicists, but interactions at new international conferences or browsing through publications often brings revealing – and potentially humbling – news about how little effect our research tends to have on what is going on elsewhere. We are unrecognized outside of our small, tightly bound professional groups, and our ideas fail to be incorporated freely throughout outsiders’ scholarly work. Putting our professional hurt feelings aside, we should have far greater concerns of possibly unneeded effort and hampered progress in the field based on unintentional ignorance of how other geographic regions are doing their bioethics. It makes no practical sense for efforts to be duplicated, especially if someone else has done it better, or at least, earlier. More wasteful is exploring already well-examined ground, and then previously found not worth any further resources. At the very least, needless research is a lost opportunity to make bioethics better.","Cooley, Dennis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100500,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

Le service des soins intensifs adultes est un service médico-chirurgical et comprend 32 lits répartis en trois unités : une unité de neuro-réanimation, une unité de médecine intensive cardiovasculaire et une unité polyvalente s’occupant des malades qui n’ont pas les spécificités des deux autres secteurs. Le service accueille plus de 2200 patients annuellement, en moyenne pour 4 jours. Le taux de mortalité est de 7,5 % en 2019 pour un SAPS2 moyen de 44 points. Une quatrième unité, non-géographique celle-là, s’occupe des besoins spécifiques des patients « long séjour » et de leurs proches ainsi que de la consultation post-réanimation, 6 et 12 mois après l’hospitalisation. Les infirmières sont spécialisées en soins intensifs et s’occupent en moyenne d’1,5 patients la journée et de 2 patients la nuit. Le service est un centre de formation pour les intensivistes suisses et un centre de recherche clinique de qualité. Summary The University Hospitals of Geneva is the largest hospital complex in Switzerland and is coupled to the Faculty of medicine of the University of Geneva. The division of adult intensive care is a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU, made of three different units: one neurocritical care unit, one cardiovascular unit, and one polyvalent unit receiving patients that do not fit into the two previous units. More than 2200 patients are hospitalised yearly in the division of adult intensive care, staying a mean of 4 days. The ICU mortality rate is 7.5% for a mean SAPS2 of 44 points. A fourth non-geographical unit with dedicated doctors and nurses is dedicated to the specific needs of “long-stayers” and their next of kin and to the organisation of post-ICU clinics, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. Nurses follow a special ICU training of 2 years, and obtain an ICU nurse certificate. One nurse takes care of 1.5 patients during the day and 2 patients during night shifts. The ICU division is a training centre for doctors to become intensivists and a centre for quality clinical research.","Pugin, Jérôme",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anrea.2020.01.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anrea.2020.01.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anrea.2020.01.003,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
1217,Experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19 in radiology department,"Abstract In December 2019, a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology were discovered in Wuhan city, China. Laboratory examination identified a novel coronavirus which was tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The WHO has more recently formally named the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). Within one month, the novel coronavirus rapidly spread across the whole of China through droplet transmission and contact transmission, and the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated a rising trend. Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography CT, were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of infected cases. Reports stated that many radiologists and technologists were being infected when examining patients with COVID-19. In order to clarify the imaging features of COVID-19 and reduce the infection risk of medical personnel in radiology departments, we summarized the experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19, aiming to guide virus prevention, diagnosis and control within radiology departments.","Ding, Jinli; Liu, Yaou; Fu, Haihong; Gao, Jianbo; Zhao, Xin; Zheng, Junhui; Sun, Wenge; Ma, Xinwu; Feng, Ji; Liang, Pan; Wu, Aiqin; Liu, Jie; Wang, Yun; Geng, Pengfei; Chen, Yong; Li, Hongjun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jrid.2020.03.006,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

We have reviewed the mechanisms of antiviral effect of HCQ, the risk-benefit ratio taking into consideration the PK/PD of HCQ and the thresholds of efficacy. We have studied its use as an antimalarial, an antiviral, and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at does matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous, which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight (2,3), at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people.","Picot, Stephane; Marty, Aileen; Bienvenu, Anne-Lise; Blumberg, Lucille H.; Dupouy-Camet, Jean; Carnevale, Pierre; Kano, Shigeyuki; Jones, Malcolm K.; Daniel-Ribeiro, Cláudio Tadeu; Mas-Coma, Santiago",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,Elsevier,10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100131,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1229,Investigating the cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China using dynamic statistical techniques,"Abstract The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia unknown cause that appeared like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that occurred in 2003. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to numerous countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the disease spread through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predict the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study reveals that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We find a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship is confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence reveals that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ∼0.10%–∼1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.","Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu; Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,Elsevier,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03747,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

However, the cellular factors that control IFITM3 homeostasis and antiviral activity have not been fully elucidated. Using site-specific photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomic analysis, here we present the identification and functional characterization of VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase as a primary interaction partner of IFITM3. We show that IFITM3 ubiquitination at lysine 24 is crucial for VCP binding, trafficking, turnover, and engagement with incoming virus particles. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of VCP/p97 ATPase activity leads to defective IFITM3 lysosomal sorting, turnover, and co-trafficking with virus particles. Our results showcase the utility of site-specific protein photo-crosslinking in mammalian cells and reveal VCP/p97 as a key cellular factor involved in IFITM3 trafficking and homeostasis.","Wu, Xiaojun; Spence, Jennifer S.; Das, Tandrila; Yuan, Xiaoqiu; Chen, Chengjie; Zhang, Yuqing; Li, Yumeng; Sun, Yanan; Chandran, Kartik; Hang, Howard C.; Peng, Tao",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.03.004,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

1242,Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Recommendations in Response to COVID-19,"Abstract Purpose During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. Patients and Methods Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation. Conclusion Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer. The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.","Zaorsky, Nicholas G.; Yu, James B.; McBride, Sean M.; Dess, Robert T.; Jackson, William C.; Mahal, Brandon A.; Chen, Ronald; Choudhury, Ananya; Henry, Ann; Syndikus, Isabel; Mitin, Timur; Tree, Alison; Kishan, Amar U.; Spratt, Daniel E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.010,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

1244,Breast radiotherapy under COVID-19 pandemic resource constraints -- approaches to defer or shorten treatment from a Comprehensive Cancer Center in the United States,"Abstract Introduction Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","Braunstein, Lior Z.; Gillespie, Erin F.; Hong, Linda; Xu, Amy; Bakhoum, Samuel F.; Cuaron, John; Mueller, Boris; McCormick, Beryl; Cahlon, Oren; Powell, Simon; Khan, Atif J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,Elsevier,10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.013,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

1248,"Management Of Patients On Dialysis And With Kidney Transplant During SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic In Brescia, Italy","Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major pandemic challenging health care systems around the world. The optimal management of COVID-19 infected patients is still unclear, although the consensus is moving towards the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anti-cytokines drugs)may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the haemophagocitic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach employed in Brescia (Italy) for managing kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, in order to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.","Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Piva, Simone; Latronico, Nicola; Focà, Emanuele; Castelli, Francesco; Gaggia, Paola; Movilli, Ezio; Bove, Sergio; Malberti, Fabio; Farina, Marco; Bracchi, Martina; Costantino, Ester Maria; Bossini, Nicola; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1250,Canada needs to rapidly escalate public health interventions for its COVID-19 mitigation strategies,"Abstract Background After the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020, local transmission chains starting in different countries including Canada are forcing governments to take decisions on public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation. Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3–4 days.","Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Wu, Jianhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
1251,Travel health risk perceptions of Chinese international students in Australia – implications for COVID-19,"Abstract Background International students frequently return to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR), and are at increased risk of travel-associated infections. Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not pre-determined but developed through content analysis. Results Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusions This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students.","Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; Raina MacIntyre, C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idh.2020.03.002,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1259,Antimicrobial resistant and extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli isolated from fecal samples of African dromedary camels,"Abstract This study was conducted to determine the distribution of antimicrobial resistance among Escherichia coli isolated from feces of healthy dromedary camels in Kenya. A total of 162 fecal samples were cultivated for E. coli. Samples were also subcultivated to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study. The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL producing E. coli was 0.6%. PCR and amplicon sequencing showed that the ESBL producer belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group A, sequence type (ST) 48, and harbored bla CTX-M-15. None of the isolates contained mcr genes. The results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of AMR E. coli, including ESBL producers, that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.","Nüesch-Inderbinen, Magdalena; Kindle, Patrick; Baschera, Melinda; Liljander, Anne; Jores, Jörg; Corman, Victor Max; Stephan, Roger",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,Elsevier,10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1262,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Summary Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). Findings Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66–97) and 24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. Interpretation Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R 0 and the duration of infectiousness.

1269,Impact of school closures for COVID-19 on the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling study,"Summary Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. Methods For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3–12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8–15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. Interpretation School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

1274,A perspective on hydrothermal processing of sewage sludge,"Abstract The US annually produces 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge. Anaerobic digestion can only reduce the sludge volume by 50% in mass, leaving the other half as a growing waste management and hygienic problem. Hydrothermal processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be used to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscalability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.","Chen, Wan-Ting; Haque, Md.

1275,Infection par le SARS-CoV-2 chez les femmes enceintes. État des connaissances et proposition de prise en charge. CNGOF,"Résumé Un nouveau coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mis en évidence en fin d’année 2019 en Chine se diffuse à travers tous les continents. Le plus souvent à l’origine d’un syndrome infectieux sans gravité, associant à différents degrés des symptômes bénins (fièvre, toux, myalgies, céphalées et éventuels troubles digestifs) le SARS-Covid-2 peut être à l’origine de pathologies pulmonaires graves et parfois de décès. Les données sur les conséquences pendant la grossesse sont limitées. Les premières données chinoises publiées semblent montrer que les symptômes chez la femme enceinte sont les mêmes que ceux de la population générale. mais il y a un risque qu'il y ai plus de formes graves. Il n’y a pas de cas de transmission maternofœtale intra utérine mais des cas de nouveau-nés infectés précocement font penser qu’il pourrait y avoir transmission verticale per-partum ou néonatale. Une prématurité induite et des cas de détresses respiratoires chez les nouveau-nés de mères infectées ont été décrits. La grossesse est connue comme une période plus à risque pour les conséquences des infections respiratoires, comme pour la grippe, il parait donc important de dépister le Covid-19 en présence de symptômes et de surveiller de façon rapprochée les femmes enceintes infectées. Dans ce contexte d’épidémie de SARS-Covid-2, les sociétés savantes de gynécologie-obstétrique, d’infectiologie et de néonatalogie ont proposé un protocole français de prise en charge des cas possibles et avérés de SARS-Covid-2 chez la femme enceinte. Ces propositions peuvent évoluer de façon quotidienne avec l’avancée de l’épidémie et des connaissances chez la femme enceinte. Abstract A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is spreading across all continents. Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.","Peyronnet, V.; Sibiude, J.; Deruelle, P.; Huissoud, C.; Lescure, X.; Lucet, J.-C.; Mandelbrot, L.; Nisand, I.; Vayssière, C.; Yazpandanah, Y.; Luton, D.; Picone, O.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.014,Elsevier,10.1016/j.gofs.2020.03.014,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19

Matériel et méthode Recommandations sur le modèle des conférences de consensus. Résultats En cas de patiente positive COVID-19, il convient de différer la prise en charge chirurgicale d’au moins 15jours. Pour le cancer du col, la place de la chirurgie doit être ré-évaluée par rapport à la radiothérapie et la radio-chimiothérapie-concomitante et l’intérêt des chirurgies de stadification ganglionnaire doit être revu au cas par cas. Pour les cancers de l’ovaire de stade avancé, il convient de privilégier la chimiothérapie néo-adjuvante même si la chirurgie de cytoréduction première pourrait être envisageable. Il est licite de ne pas proposer la chimiothérapie hyperthermique intra-péritonéale en période de pandémie COVID-19. Pour les cas des patientes qui doivent bénéficier d’une chirurgie d’intervalle, il est possible de poursuivre la chimiothérapie et de proposer une chirurgie de clôture après 6 cycles de chimiothérapie. Pour le cancer de l’endomètre de stade précoce, en cas de risque ESMO préopératoire faible et intermédiaire, il faut privilégier une hystérectomie totale avec annexectomie bilatérale associée à une procédure du ganglion sentinelle. Il est licite d’envisager le report de 1 à 2 mois de la chirurgie dans les cancers de l’endomètre de bas risque (stade FIGO Ia sur l’IRM et cancer endométrioïde de grade 1-2 sur la biopsie endométriale). Pour les risques ESMO élevés, il semble légitime de privilégier l’algorithme du MSKCC (associant TEP TDM et procédure du GS) afin d’omettre les lympahdénectomies pelviennes et lomboaortiques. Conclusion En période de pandémie COVID-19, il convient de ne pas faire perdre de chance aux patientes atteintes de cancer, tout en limitant les risques liés au virus. Abstract Introduction Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Material and method Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies.

1279,Recommendations for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF,"Abstract Introduction In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer. Materials and method The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery. It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles. For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended. Surgery can be postponed for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.","Akladios, Cherif; Azais, Henri; Ballester, Marcos; Bendifallah, Sofiane; Bolze, Pierre-Adrien; Bourdel, Nicolas; Bricou, Alexandre; Canlorbe, Geoffroy; Carcopino, Xavier; Chauvet, Pauline; Collinet, Pierre; Coutant, Charles; Dabi, Yohann; Dion, Ludivine; Gauthier, Tristan; Graesslin, Olivier; Huchon, Cyrille; Koskas, Martin; Kridelka, Frederic; Lavoue, Vincent; Lecointre, Lise; Mezzadri, Matthieu; Mimoun, Camille; Ouldamer, Lobna; Raimond, Emilie; Touboul, Cyril",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101729,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101729,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101729,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

1286,Chinese experts’ consensus on the Internet of Things-aided diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Abstract The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the “COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)” based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the “cloud” through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to enable different levels of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment among different doctors from different hospitals to upgrade to the national and international through the intelligent assistance of the nCapp system. In this way, we can block disease transmission, avoid physician infection, and epidemic prevention and control as soon as possible.","Bai, Li; Yang, Dawei; Wang, Xun; Tong, Lin; Zhu, Xiaodan; Zhong, Nanshan; Bai, Chunxue; Powell, Charles A.; Chen, Rongchang; Zhou, Jian; Song, Yuanlin; Zhou, Xin; Zhu, Huili; Han, Baohui; Li, Qiang; Shi, Guochao; Li, Shengqing; Wang, Changhui; Qiu, Zhongmin; Zhang, Yong; Xu, Yu; Liu, Jie; Zhang, Ding; Wu, Chaomin; Li, Jing; Yu, Jinming; Wang, Jiwei; Dong, Chunling; Wang, Yaoli; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Lichuan; Zhang, Min; Ma, Xia; Zhao, Lin; Yu, Wencheng; Xu, Tao; Jin, Yang; Wang, Xiongbiao; Wang, Yuehong; Jiang, Yan; Chen, Hong; Xiao, Kui; Zhang, Xiaoju; Song, Zhenju; Zhang, Ziqiang; Wu, Xueling; Sun, Jiayuan; Shen, Yao; Ye, Maosong; Tu, Chunlin; Jiang, Jinjun; Yu, Hai; Tan, Fei",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ceh.2020.03.001,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31
1287,"Antiviraux chez l’enfant en pratique de ville : infections herpétiques, varicelle, grippe","Résumé Les infections liées à l'herpès virus humain (HSV), au virus de la varicelle et du zona (VZV) et au virus de la grippe (Influenza A et B) sont très fréquentes en pédiatrie et sont le plus souvent bénignes avec une guérison spontanée. L'utilisation des antiviraux antigrippaux (inhibiteurs de neuraminidase) a été étudiée dans de larges essais randomisés et fait l'objet de recommandations nationales et internationales. Celle des anti-HSV et anti-VZV n’a pas fait l’objet d’études de la même ampleur et de ce fait, leur prescription est plus discutée avec des bénéfices moins bien définis et variables (à l'exception des infections néonatales et/ou neuro-méningées). L'objectif de cette mise au point est donc de proposer une synthèse des données disponibles dans la littérature concernant les indications des antiviraux en pratique de ville pour les infections liées à l'HSV (gingivostomatite, herpès récurrent, faux panaris herpétique), au VZV (varicelle, zona) et à la grippe. Abstract Human herpes virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and the flu (influenza A and B) are very common in pediatrics and most often cause mild disease with spontaneous recovery. The use of influenza antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors) has been studied in large randomized trials and is the focus of national and international recommendations. The use of anti-HSV and VZV compounds has not been the subject of large studies and is often more controversial (except for neonatal infection and/or meningoencephalitis). The objective of this review is therefore to offer an overview of the available data in the literature on the indications for antivirals for HSV-related infections (gingivostomatitis, recurrent herpes, herpetic whitlow), VZV (chickenpox, herpes zoster), and influenza in a pediatric outpatient setting.","Launay, E.; Gras Le Guen, C.; Pinquier, D.; Dommergues, M.-A.; Cohen, R.; Grimprel, E.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.perped.2020.03.009,06/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-06
1288,Deliberate release: Plague – A review,"Abstract Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001,30/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-30
1289,Engineered human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides inhibit Ebola virus infection,"Summary The 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak coupled with the most recent outbreaks in Central Africa underscore the need to develop effective treatment strategies against EBOV. While several therapeutic options have shown great potential, developing a wider breadth of countermeasures would increase our efforts to combat the highly lethal EBOV. Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most likely due to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify AMPs as a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering AMPs for improved therapeutic efficacy.","Yu, Yangsheng; Cooper, Christopher L.; Wang, Guangshun; Morwitzer, M.

1290,Colorimetric biosensors for point-of-care virus detections,"Abstract Colorimetric biosensors can be used to detect a particular analyte through color changes easily by naked eyes or simple portable optical detectors for quantitative measurement. Thus, it is highly attractive for point-of-care detections of harmful viruses to prevent potential pandemic outbreak, as antiviral medication must be administered in a timely fashion. This review paper summaries existing and emerging techniques that can be employed to detect viruses through colorimetric assay design with detailed discussion of their sensing principles, performances as well as pros and cons, with an aim to provide guideline on the selection of suitable colorimetric biosensors for detecting different species of viruses. Among the colorimetric methods for virus detections, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is more favourable for its faster detection, high efficiency, cheaper cost, and more reliable with high reproducible assay results. Nanoparticle-based colorimetric biosensors, on the other hand, are most suitable to be fabricated into lateral flow or lab-on-a-chip devices, and can be coupled with LAMP or portable PCR systems for highly sensitive on-site detection of viruses, which is very critical for early diagnosis of virus infections and to prevent outbreak in a swift and controlled manner.","Zhao, Victoria Xin Ting; Wong, Ten It; Zheng, Xin Ting; Tan, Yen Nee; Zhou, Xiaodong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mset.2019.10.002,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

1292,Facemask shortage and the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflections on public health measures,"Abstract Background A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Methods We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Findings Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million. Interpretation Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","Wu, Huai-liang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J.P.; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-Kit",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329,03/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-03
1293,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 infection,"Abstract Background The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide. In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43–63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. Interpretation In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44·1%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20·5%.

1297,"Outcome of Coronavirus spectrum infections (SARS, MERS, COVID 1 -19) during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis","ABSTRACT Objective The aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-COV-2 infection during pregnancy. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for “coronavirus” or “severe acute respiratory syndrome” or “SARS” or “Middle East respiratory syndrome” or “MERS” or “COVID-19” and “pregnancy”. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.","Di Mascio, Daniele; Khalil, Asma; Saccone, Gabriele; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Buca, Danilo; Liberati, Marco; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Nappi, Luigi; Scambia, Giovanni; Berghella, Vincenzo; D’Antonio, Francesco",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100107,25/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-25

1302,"Assessment of the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number, R 0, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy","Abstract As of March 12th Italy has the largest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Europe as well as outside China. The infections, first limited in Northern Italy, have eventually spread to all other regions. When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R 0, i.e. the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. Previous work has been limited to the assessment of R 0 analyzing data from the Wuhan region or Mainland China. In the present study the R 0 value for SARS-CoV-2 was assessed analyzing data derived from the early phase of the outbreak in Italy. In particular, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in 9 cities (those with the largest number of infections) fitting the well-established SIR-model to available data in the interval between February 25–March 12, 2020. The findings of this study suggest that R 0 values associated with the Italian outbreak may range from 2.43 to 3.10, confirming previous evidence in the literature reporting similar R 0 values for SARS-CoV-2.","D'Arienzo, Marco; Coniglio, Angela",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.03.004,02/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-02

This year was to be the “super year” for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRR-specific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to manage both disaster risks and potential health-emergencies, particularly for humanitarian coordination aspects; and the strengthening of community-level preparedness and response.","Djalante, Riyanti; Shaw, Rajib; DeWit, Andrew",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,Elsevier,10.1016/j.pdisas.2020.100080,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

1307,Preventing respiratory syncytial virus infections in hospitalized children and adults: should we do better?,"Summary Objective To compare the burden of nosocomial and community-acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly admitted to a French tertiary hospital, and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing infection control measures. Patients and methods We prospectively included all adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital (Paris) between October 2018 and February 2019 with a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and, in each group, between children and adults. Results Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients, respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients, respectively (p < 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs, those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6%, p = 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0%, p < 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting a good effectiveness of our infection control strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare personnel, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial RSV infections should be reinforced in adult wards.","Frange, Pierre; Toubiana, Julie; Parize, Perrine; Moulin, Florence; Scemla, Anne; Leruez-Ville, Marianne",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,Elsevier,10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100041,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30
1308,Mesenchymal stem cells and management of COVID-19 pneumonia,"Abstract Human coronavirus, hCoV-19, is highly pathogenic with severe pneumonia associated with rapid virus replication. Arising in Wuhan China December 2019, the current COVID-19 epidemic has rapidly grown with person-to-person infection expanding to become a global health emergency now on pandemic scale. Governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread in mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact. The scale of the problem is massive. Here I consider new approaches to improve patient's biological resistance to COVID-19 using stem cells, and how benefit might be scaled and simplified using synthetic stem cells to meet logistical needs within a short time frame.","Metcalfe, Su M.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100019,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
1309,Novel decoy cellular vaccine strategy utilizing transgenic antigen-expressing cells as immune presenter and adjuvant in vaccine prototype against SARS-CoV-2 virus,"Abstract A novel approach modifying cells to express viral markers to elicit protective immunity responses (decoy cellular vaccination) in the prevention of COVID-19 disease is currently being explored. Our approach entails utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen-expressing, non-replicating cells as carriers and presenters of immunogenic antigens, so called “I-cells”. By using irradiated cells as presenting vehicles of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens(s) in a cellular context, these presented viral proteins can be recognized by the host immune system, thus, an efficient protective immune response might be elicited. Another advantage of this strategy is that the manufacturing process is scalable and yields uniform cell products allowing for “off-the-shelf” frozen supply availability. To prevent engraftment and proliferation of the cells after administration, the cells will be irradiated post-harvesting abolishing in vivo replication potential. Specifically, immunoreactive Spike-1 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 are expressed on the surface of irradiated target I-cells. Utilizing this innovative strategy, these viral antigen-displaying decoy cells will be developed as a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease.","Ji, Henry; Yan, Ying; Ding, Beibei; Guo, Wenzhong; Brunswick, Mark; Niethammer, Andreas; SooHoo, Williams; Smith, Robin; Nahama, Alexis; Zhang, Yanliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100026,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","Nahama, Alexis; Ramachandran, Roshni; Cisternas, Alvaro Francisco; Ji, Henry",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,Elsevier,10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100033,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1314,"Effects of plane of milk-replacer nutrition on the health, behavior, and performance of high-risk Holstein bull calves from a commercial calf ranch","ABSTRACT Objective This research study aimed to determine whether preweaning plane of milk-replacer nutrition influences health, standing and oral behaviors, and performance of high-risk calves. Materials and Methods Thirty-six Holstein bull calves (1 d of age) from a commercial calf ranch were assigned to either a high plane of milk-replacer nutrition (HPN; n = 18; 20 and 28% DM lipid and protein, respectively, Cow’s Match, Land O’Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co., Shoreview, MN) or a low plane of milk-replacer nutrition (LPN; n = 18; 20% DM lipid and protein, Herd Maker, Land O’Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co.) through weaning. Total serum protein concentrations confirmed that 72 and 76% of calves had failure of passive transfer (<5.2 g/dL) in HPN and LPN, respectively. All calves were bottle fed twice daily. The LPN were fed 455 g of DM/d of milk replacer (MR) until weaning, and the HPN calves were fed 830 g of DM/d of milk replacer during the first 10 d and 1,080 g from 11 d until weaning. Calf starter and water were offered ad libitum. Calves were step-down weaned beginning at 51 d and completely weaned after 58 d when consuming 1 kg of calf starter (as-fed basis). Data are reported as HPN versus LPN throughout, respectively. Results and Discussion Risk for bloat and scouring were greater for calves fed the HPN, but there was no difference in antibiotic treatment or mortality. The HPN calves had greater performance over the preweaning period including final BW, ADG, and feed:gain (total kg of milk replacer + calf starter, kg of DM/kg of BW gain), but weaning was more stressful for HPN calves. Implications and Applications In conclusion, the high-risk calves fed a HPN had increased preweaning ADG, but there was also an increased incidence of scours. There may be differences in the health status of calves that may affect the ability to consume and use high MR levels. When feeding high-risk calves there may be a need for alternate strategies when determining the quality and quantity of MR being fed when compared with low-risk calves. Differences in gut integrity may influence the ability of high-risk calves to handle high levels of MR early in life. Potential issues with high-risk calves being fed a HPN might be reduced with increased feeding times per day, a gradual step-up method, or other nutritional strategies that improve gastrointestinal development and function.","Sharon, K.P.; Hulbert, L.E.; Davis, E.M.; Ballou, M.A.",https://www.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2019-01886,https://doi.org/10.15232/aas.2019-01886,Elsevier,10.15232/aas.2019-01886,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

1331,COVID-19: Challenges to GIS with Big Data,"Abstract The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 100,000 people infected and thousands of deaths. Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy. Currently and for a long time in the future, the development of GIS should be strengthened to form a data-driven system for rapid knowledge acquisition, which signifies that GIS should be used to reinforce the social operation parameterization of models and methods, especially when providing support for social management.","Zhou, Chenghu; Su, Fenzhen; Pei, Tao; Zhang, An; Du, Yunyan; Luo, Bin; Cao, Zhidong; Wang, Juanle; Yuan, Wen; Zhu, Yunqiang; Song, Ci; Chen, Jie; Xu, Jun; Li, Fujia; Ma, Ting; Jiang, Lili; Yan, Fengqin; Yi, Jiawei; Hu, Yunfeng; Liao, Yilan; Xiao, Han",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.geosus.2020.03.005,20/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-20
1332,COVID-19 in the Shadows of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has plagued the Middle East since it was first reported in 2012. Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named SARS-CoV-2. Most cases are in Mainland China with international spread to 25 countries. The novelty of the virus, the rapid national and international spread, and the lack of therapeutic and preventative strategies have led the WHO International Health Regulation emergency committee to declare the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. As it relates to countries with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for HCWs to deal with both coronaviruses, especially with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since both coronaviruses have similar presentation. Those patients should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the continuing wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days will be of less significance","Memish, Mazin Barry; Maha Al, Amri; Ziad, A.",https://www.doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200218.003,CZI,MA ID 2093640054,2020,NA,NA,2020
1333,Preliminary Identification of Potential Vaccine Targets for the COVID-19 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Based on SARS-CoV Immunological Studies,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","Ahmed, F. Syed; Quadeer, A. Ahmed; McKay, R.

1335,Uncertainties about the transmission routes of 2019 novel coronavirus,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (now named as SARS‐CoV‐2) caused an outbreak of SARS‐like illness in the late of December 2019. At present, the origin, susceptible population, and infection sources already have been clear.1, 2 However, the transmission routes, a key step to the epidemic control, have not yet been fully ascertained. Here, we focus on the potential transmission routes that have been investigated in the SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic recently. SARS‐CoV‐2, similar to SARS and MERS, is predominantly spread via respiratory tract with high infectivity. It is commonly recognized that droplet transmission is the main route. Spread by aerosol is suspected to be another important route of transmission but unestablished now. Epidemiological experts, as well as the WHO, consider more evidence is needed to confirm.3 Besides, there are other routes except respiratory transmission. The previous study indicated that different human coronaviruses, such as SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, can maintain infectious for a different time on inanimate surfaces.4 Meanwhile, it was reported that SARS‐CoV‐2 was also founded on the surface of the door handles, cell phones, and other items in the residential sites of confirmed cases.5 Therefore, individuals will be probably infected if they touch the nose, mouth, or eyes after contacting the contaminated items.","Han, Qingmei; Lin, Qingqing; Ni, Zuowei; You, Liangshun",https://www.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12735,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12735,CZI,MA ID 3002533591,2020,NA,NA,2020

1337,The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2,"The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.","Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Baker, Susan C.; Baric, Ralph S.; de Groot, Raoul J.; Drosten, Christian; Gulyaeva, Anastasia A.; Haagmans, Bart L.; Lauber, Chris; Leontovich, Andrey M.; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Penzar, Dmitry; Perlman, Stanley; Poon, Leo L.

Searches were limited to English language publications.Eligibility criteria for study selection Original articles describing a new multimorbidity index including more information than disease counts and not focusing on comorbidity associated with one specific disease. Studies were of adults based in the community or at population level.Results Among 7128 search results, 5560 unique titles were identified. After screening against eligibility criteria the review finally included 35 papers. As index components, 25 indices used conditions (weighted or in combination with other parameters), five used diagnostic categories, four used drug use, and one used physiological measures. Predicted outcomes included mortality (18 indices), healthcare use or costs (13), hospital admission (13), and health related quality of life (7). 29 indices considered some aspect of mental health, with most including it as a comorbidity. 12 indices are recommended for use.Conclusions 35 multimorbidity indices are available, with differing components and outcomes.

1342,"2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: Human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness","On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

1343,Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practice,"A possible threat in the ophthalmology clinic While the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown, countries have been preparing measures based on past experiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454","Seah, Ivan; Su, Xinyi; Lingam, Gopal",https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0790-7,CZI,MA ID 3005477973,2020,NA,NA,2020

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.","Pang, Junxiong; Wang, Min Xian; Ang, Ian Yi Han; Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan; Lewis, Ruth Frances; Chen, Jacinta I.

1347,Editor's Note,"A few years ago, when I wrote an editorial note, there was an unseasonable heavy snowfall,making the city of Tokyo havoc. This time the cause is the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).Infection by this novel virus had become grave news involving the whole world by the end ofJanuary. Now, as I am writing this, there is no cure, and the number of patients is also increasingday by day in Japan. Masks are out of stock throughout the city, and I have heard that people queueup for few masks in front of drug stores from early in the morning.The effectiveness of wearing a mask to prevent infection is limited. What is the cause of such asituation? As a matter of fact, in an epidemic of infection, the most serious problem is not infectionitself, but unscientific rumors and people who are easily swayed by them. Avoidance of vaccinationby insisting that vaccines have no effect or that they are harmful to the body is fundamentally thesame. The anti-vaccination movement still exists despite the evidence-based medicine, and thereare concerns about its expansion. However, even with scientific evidence, it is not easy to persuadeanti-vaccinationists, and this is the moment, when we, academia, feel powerless.Nevertheless, we should not be discouraged. The mission of academia is to conduct reliableresearch. Reliable data are obtained from such research, and scientific solution of the problemssteadily proceed. Based on the outcomes of these data and solutions, scientists themselves shouldcreate the methods of advocacy and persuasion or rely on experts in this area.However, scientists should solve the problems with science. Academic journals such as theJuntendo Medical Journal may be of marked significance in this regard.

1348,Emergence of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Need for Rapid Vaccine and Biologics Development,"Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus&rsquo;s reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Malla, Ashwini; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",https://www.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9020148,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9020148,CZI,MA ID 3003886061,2020,NA,NA,2020

Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.","Yee, Jane; Unger, Lucy; Zadravecz, Frank; Cariello, Paloma; Seibert, Allan; Johnson, Michael Austin; Fuller, Matthew Joseph",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12034,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12034,CZI,MA ID 3005586004,2020,NA,NA,2020

The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery.

This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death. Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection. In this context, both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count. Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation. Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection.

1362,"Daily Situation Report on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran; March 22, 2020","To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

1365,"Daily Situation Report on Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Iran; March 17, 2020","The main strategy of the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the control of COVID-19 is active case finding using electronic tools, taking advantage of the capacity of the national primary health care (PHC) network, and community engagement. To accomplish this, all people are asked to participate in the screening process using the MOH's self-assessment portal (salamat.gov.ir). Health workers and public volunteers actively contact suspected cases using information recorded in this portal, as well as the electronic health record (SIB portal). They actively evaluate individuals, follow-up them, and provide them with necessary information. Where needed, clients are referred to 16-hour treatment clinics, which are specifically set up for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, to the hospitals, or will be treated at home.

1366,Epidemiological and Clinical Aspects of COVID-19; a Narrative Review,"There are significant misconceptions and many obstacles in the way of illuminating the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 as a new emerging epidemic. In addition, usefulness of some evidence published in the context of the recent epidemic for decision making in clinic as well as public health is questionable. However, misinterpreting or ignoring strong evidence in clinical practice and public health probably results in less effective and somehow more harmful decisions for individuals as well as subgroups in general populations of countries in the initial stages of this epidemic. Accordingly, our narrative review appraised epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease including genetic diversity of coronavirus genus, mode of transmission, incubation period, infectivity, pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, diagnosis, surveillance, clinical case management and also successful measures for preventing its spread in some communities.","Kolifarhood, Goodarz; Aghaali, Mohammad; Mozafar Saadati, Hossein; Taherpour, Niloufar; Rahimi, Sajjad; Izadi, Neda; Hashemi Nazari, Seyed Saeed",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117787/,PMC,CORD-19 ID vwf2djd4,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

Urgent gynaecological and cancer procedures are continuing, and it is imperative all theatre staff are protected and risks of SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission reduced when operating on asymptomatic, suspected or confirmed COVID 19 patients. In particular, there are concerns relating to the transmission of COVID 19 during gynaecological laparoscopic surgery, arising from the potential generation of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated aerosols from CO(2) leakage and the creation of smoke from the use of energy devices. The aim of this paper is to review all the up to date evidence, including experiences from China and Italy, to guide the safe management of such patients when undergoing gynaecological procedures.","Mallick, R; Odejinmi, F; Clark, TJ",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117791/,PMC,CORD-19 ID wy9k0508,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
1368,Laboratory Parameters in Detection of COVID-19 Patients with Positive RT-PCR; a Diagnostic Accuracy Study,"INTRODUCTION: The role of laboratory parameters in screening of COVID-19 cases has not been definitely established. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on suspected COVID-19 patients, who presented to Behpooyan Clinic Medical center in Tehran (Iran) from 22 February to 14 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of real time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, and the accuracy of different laboratory parameters in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: Two hundred cases with the mean age of 41.3± 14.6 (range: 19-78) years were studied (0.53% male). The result of RT-PCR for COVID-19 was positive in 70 (35%) cases. Patients with positive RT-PCR had significantly higher neutrophil (NEU) count (p = 0.0001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0.0001), and Urea (p = 0.001) levels in serum. In addition, patients with positive RT-PCR had lower white blood cell (WBC) count (p = 0.0001) and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001) compared to others. ALT (AUC = 0.879), CRP (AUC = 0.870), NEU (AUC = 0.858), LDH (AUC = 0.835), and Urea (AUC = 0.835) had very good accuracy in predicting cases with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that level of LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU can be used to predict the result of COVID-19 test. They can help in detection of COVID-19 patients.","Mardani, Rajab; Ahmadi Vasmehjani, Abbas; Zali, Fatemeh; Gholami, Alireza; Mousavi Nasab, Seyed Dawood; Kaghazian, Hooman; Kaviani, Mehdi; Ahmadi, Nayebali",https://www.doi.org/nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130449/,PMC,CORD-19 ID p3g9nyl6,04/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-04

1370,Clinical features and dynamics of viral load in imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19,"Abstract Objectives To compare the clinical characteristics and the dynamics of viral load between the imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19. Design and methods Data from 51 laboratory-confirmed patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results The incubation period in the tertiary group was longer than that in the imported and secondary groups (both P < 0.05). Fever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and half of the patients had a low-grade temperature (<38.0℃) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). The CT scan showed that most patients had bilateral pneumonia in the three groups (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively). Ct values detected from the tertiary patients were similar to those from the imported and secondary groups at the time of admission (both P > 0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable for half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7, and all patients on day 14. For 1/3rd of the patients in the imported and secondary groups, the viral load remained positive on day 14 after the admission. Conclusions COVID-19 can present as pneumonia with less onset of symptoms, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease in the tertiary patients.","Xu, Tianmin; Chen, Cong; Zhu, Zhen; Cui, Manman; Chen, Chunhua; Dai, Hong; Xue, Yuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.022,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14

1372,A precision medicine approach to managing 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia,"In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible—or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.","Wang, Minjin; Zhou, Yanbing; Zong, Zhiyong; Liang, Zongan; Cao, Yu; Tang, Hong; Song, Bin; Huang, Zixing; Kang, Yan; Feng, Ping; Ying, Binwu; Li, Weimin",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa002,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107203/,PMC,MA ID 3006495046,04/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-04

The Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services and systems are a new initiative from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that seeks to provide science-based integrated urban services supporting safe, healthy and resilient cities. Various cities have already started development and implementation of such Integrated Urban Services and successfully test and use them following specific requirements of local stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS) from a set of four case study cities: Hong Kong, Toronto, Mexico City and Paris, that use different IUS configurations with good existing practice. These cities represent a range of countries, climates and geophysical settings. The aggregate main joint similarities of the IUS in these cities and synergy of the cities' experience, achievements and research findings are presented, as well as identification of existing gaps in knowledge and further research needs. A list of potential criteria for identifying and classifying IUS demonstration cities is proposed. It will aid future, more detailed analysis of the IUS experience, and selection of additional demonstration cities.","Baklanov, Alexander; Cárdenas, Beatriz; Lee, Tsz-cheung; Leroyer, Sylvie; Masson, Valery; Molina, Luisa T.; Müller, Tanya; Ren, Chao; Vogel, Felix R.; Voogt, James A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100610,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100610,Elsevier,10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100610,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow-up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cases. The follow-up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace opacification.","Diao, Kaiyue; Han, Peilun; Pang, Tong; Li, Yuan; Yang, Zhigang",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa004,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107051/,PMC,MA ID 3006467527,11/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-11

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02–1.04), length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% CI = 1.013–1.024), sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% CI = 1.778–2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.111–2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% CI = 1.152–5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered. Conclusions Our findings suggest that urinary tract infection prevalence was higher in women without evidence of organ injury and those receiving medical treatment.

1379,Interrupting COVID-19 transmission by implementing enhanced traffic control bundling: Implications for global prevention and control efforts,"Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19’s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan’s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB’s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector – the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community. Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan’s success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Schwartz, Jonathan; Chen, Shey-Ying; King, Chwan-Chuen; Yang, Guang-Yang; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.011,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14

1382,An efficient pattern growth approach for mining fault tolerant frequent itemsets,"Abstract Mining fault tolerant (FT) frequent itemsets from transactional databases are computationally more expensive than mining exact matching frequent itemsets. Previous algorithms mine FT frequent itemsets using Apriori heuristic. Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.","Bashir, Shariq",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01
1383,Liver injury in COVID-19: management and challenges,"SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% genome sequence similarity to SARS-CoV and 50% genome sequence homology to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)—all three coronaviruses are known to cause severe respiratory symptoms. Liver impairment has been reported in up to 60% of patients with SARS3 and has also been reported in patients infected with MERS-CoV.4 At least seven relatively large-scale case studies have reported the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 In this Comment, we assess how the liver is affected using the available case studies and data from The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital, Beijing, China. These data indicate that 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14–53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression (table). Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have higher rates of liver dysfunction. In a study in The Lancet by Huang and colleagues,5 elevation of AST was observed in eight (62%) of 13 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with seven (25%) of 28 patients who did not require care in the ICU. Moreover, in a large cohort including 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces or provincial municipalities, more severe patients with disease had abnormal liver aminotransferase levels than did non-severe patients with disease.1 Furthermore, in another study,8 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by CT scan while in the subclinical phase (ie, before symptom onset) had significantly lower incidence of AST abnormality than did patients diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19.","Zhang, Chao; Shi, Lei; Wang, Fu-Sheng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30057-1,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30057-1,Elsevier,MA ID 2398802113,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04
1384,Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study,"Abstract Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.","Liu, Kai; Zhang, Weitong; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Jinpeng; Li, Yunqian; Chen, Ying",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas.

1389,99mTc-radiolabeled Levofloxacin and micelles as infection and inflammation imaging agents,"Abstract Easy and early detection of infection and inflammation is essential for early and effective treatment. In this study, PEGylated micelles were designed and both micelles and Levofloxacin were radiolabeled with 99mTcO4 - to develop potential radiotracers for detection of infection/inflammation. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles were compared. The aim of this study is to formulate and compare 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles as infection and inflammation agents having different mechanisms for the accumulation at infection and inflammation site. PEGylated micelles were designed with a particle size of 80 ± 0.7 nm and proper characterization properties. High radiolabeling efficiency was achieved for 99mTc-Levofloxacin (96%) and 99mTc-micelles (87%). The radiolabeling efficiency was remained stable with some insignificant alterations for both radiotracers at 25 °C for 24 h. Although in vitro bacterial binding of 99mTc-levofloxacine was higher than 99mTc-micelles, 99mTc-micelles may also be evaluated potential agent due to long circulation and passive accumulation mechanisms at infection/inflammation site. Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view.","Silindir-Gunay, Mine; Ozer, Asuman Yekta",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jddst.2020.101571,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

1393,Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19,"Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shi, Yudong; Wang, Juan; Yang, Yating; Wang, Zhiqiang; Wang, Guoqing; Hashimoto, Kenji; Zhang, Kai; Liu, Huanzhong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
1394,Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children).1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented.2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted. Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health.3 , 4 Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness.3 , 5 Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak.","Wang, Guanghai; Zhang, Yunting; Zhao, Jin; Zhang, Jun; Jiang, Fan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30547-x,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30547-x,Elsevier,MA ID 1968779433,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04

1396,Topological data analysis to model the shape of immune responses during co-infections,"Abstract Co-infections by multiple pathogens have important implications in many aspects of health, epidemiology and evolution. However, how to disentangle the non-linear dynamics of the immune response when two infections take place at the same time is largely unexplored. Using data sets of the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection in mice, we employ here topological data analysis to simplify and visualise high dimensional data sets. We identified persistent shapes of the simplicial complexes of the data in the three infection scenarios: single viral infection, single bacterial infection, and co-infection. The immune response was found to be distinct for each of the infection scenarios and we uncovered that the immune response during the co-infection has three phases and two transition points. During the first phase, its dynamics is inherited from its response to the primary (viral) infection. The immune response has an early shift (few hours post co-infection) and then modulates its response to react against the secondary (bacterial) infection. Between 18 and 26 h post co-infection the nature of the immune response changes again and does no longer resembles either of the single infection scenarios.","Sasaki, Karin; Bruder, Dunja; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,Elsevier,10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105228,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 ≈ 2.4829 . The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization.","Khan, Muhammad Altaf; Atangana, Abdon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2020.02.033,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2020.02.033,Elsevier,10.1016/j.aej.2020.02.033,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14
1404,Clinical Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by Epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) Infection: A Hint for COVID-19 Treatment,"Abstract H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts and carry the risk of human-to-human transmission, as shown by the 2013 outbreak. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was used to treat H7N9-induced ARDS in 2013. The transplant of MSCs into patients with H7N9-induced ARDS was conducted at a single center through an open-label clinical trial. Based on the principles of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS were included as a control group, while 17 patients with H7N9-induced ARDS acted as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived MSCs. It was notable that MSC transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the experimental group, compared with the control group (17.6% died in the experimental group while 54.5% died in the control group). Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in the bodies of four of the patients who were part of the five-year follow-up period. Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve the survival rate of H7N9-induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9-induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (e.g., ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.","Chen, Jiajia; Hu, Chenxia; Chen, Lijun; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Yixin; Xu, Xiaowei; Chen, Lu; Gao, Hainv; Lu, Xiaoqing; Yu, Liang; Dai, Xiahong; Xiang, Charlie; Li, Lanjuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eng.2020.02.006,28/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-28

1414,"Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China","Summary Background Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. Results Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2–7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12–20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8–11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10–12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. Conclusions The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.","Chen, Jun; Qi, Tangkai; Liu, Li; Ling, Yun; Qian, Zhiping; Li, Tao; Li, Feng; Xu, Qingnian; Zhang, Yuyi; Xu, Shuibao; Song, Zhigang; Zeng, Yigang; Shen, Yinzhong; Shi, Yuxin; Zhu, Tongyu; Lu, Hongzhou",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004,19/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-19
1415,The signal peptide as a new target for drug design,"Abstract Many current and potential drug targets are membrane-bound or secreted proteins that are expressed and transported via the Sec61 secretory pathway. They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins. The SP may thus become a validated target for designing drugs for numerous disorders, including certain hereditary diseases.","Lumangtad, Liezel A.; Bell, Thomas W.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127115,15/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-15
1416,Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?,"Summary The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Chiew, Calvin J; Lee, Vernon J",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30129-8,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30129-8,Elsevier,MA ID 3006642361,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
1417,"Asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2): Facts and myths","Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Liu, Yen Hung; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Yen, Muh-Yen; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012,CZI,MA ID 2029688661,2020,NA,NA,2020
1418,"Étiologies virales des infections respiratoires basses chez des patients adultes hospitalisés dans un service de pneumologie à Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire","Introduction La pneumonie est une cause majeure de morbidité et une cause importante de mortalité dans le monde [1]. Les étiologies sont dominées par les causes infectieuses, parmi lesquelles les bactéries et les virus occupent une place importante. Les virus sont responsables de la forme la plus grave de l’infection [2]. L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier les causes virales des infections respiratoires basses chez les patients adultes. Méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude prospective et descriptive menée sur la base de recrutement successif de patients âgés de 15 ans et plus, admis au service de pneumologie du CHU de Cocody du 1er février 2016 au 31 octobre 2017 pour pneumopathie alvéolo-interstitielle fébrile sévère confirmée à la radiographie du thorax de face ou au scanner thoracique avec des bacilloscopies négatives et qui ont bénéficié d’une fibroscopie bronchique avec lavage broncho-alvéolaire. Résultats Nous avons inclus 33 dossiers sur 90 dossiers durant la période d’étude. Le sex-ratio était de 1,1 avec une moyenne d’âge de 39,6 ans (19–68 ans). La tranche d’âge de 30–40 ans était plus sujette aux pneumonies (48,5 %). L’inclusion des patients était plus importante pendant la saison de mars à juin (45,5 %). La détection de virus respiratoire par la réaction en chaîne de polymérase inverse multiplex en temps réel (RT-PCR) était positive dans 21,2 % des cas (7/33). Les virus retrouvés étaient : parainfluenza-3 (57,1 % 4/7), coronavirus OC43 (14,3 % 1/7), coronavirus HKUI (14,3 % 1/7) et rhinovirus humain (14,3 % 1/7).

1424,Responding to health emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region in times of conflict,"WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) is facing emergencies on a scale that is perhaps unprecedented in its history. There is armed conflict in 12 of the region's 22 countries.1 , 2 The region's 680 million people3 represent 9% of the global population, yet the EMR is home to 43% of those who need humanitarian assistance4 and is the source of 64% of the world's refugees.5 The health effects of these crises are immense. Direct health consequences include trauma-related deaths and disability, gender-based violence, and mental disorders. Disruption of health systems contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, malnutrition, obstetric complications, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.

1432,Hospital biopreparedness in the Looming Presence of SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19,"The recent analysis of 138 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and their clinical characteristics, has given credence to stronger investments into hospital biopreparedness and overall infection prevention efforts.1 Within this analysis, researchers found two pieces that are particularly relevant to healthcare preparedness: first, that 26% of patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and second, that 41% of cases were related to healthcare transmission. Patients requiring medical care in an intensive care unit inherently burden the system more, both in terms of supplies in personnel, but also because they typically have greater lengths of stay. The volume of healthcare‐associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have been observed in previous coronavirus outbreaks. Indeed, hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease transmission during these events. In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) outbreak in Toronto highlighted this very real vulnerability, where busy emergency departments, delays in isolation, and improper personal protective equipment (PPE) use fueled the spread of disease in several hospitals.2 Enhanced infection prevention measures were eventually implemented (higher level of PPE, masking when in public areas, among others), which helped bring transmission to halt. After the outbreak was believed to be over, however, directives were given to discontinue those enhanced infection prevention measures. As a result of this and staff no longer routinely wearing masks in general hospital areas, a second phase of the outbreak began. An overwhelming majority of cases in Phase II of the Toronto SARS‐CoV were related to healthcare transmission.3","Popescu, Saskia",https://www.doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.149,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7136478/,PMC,10.1002/hsr2.149,09/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-09
1433,Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer,"In December 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the Chinese province of Hubei.[1] The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition, defined coronavirus disease (COVID-19).[2] The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of February.[3] After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days, with 80% of those infected developing a mild disease, 15% a severe disease and 5% will require support in intensive care unit (ICU).[4] Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28.[4,5] SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist, thus everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.","Lombardi, Andrea; Bozzi, Giorgio; Mangioni, Davide; Muscatello, Antonio; Peri, Anna Maria; Taramasso, Lucia; Ungaro, Riccardo; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003,Elsevier,MA ID 3005788786,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06

Simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA are of great importance for early-stage diagnosis and operator protection. Herein, a magnetism and size mediated microfluidic platform was developed for point-of-care detection of multiple influenza HA. With multiplex microvalves and computer program control, the detection process showed high automation which had a great potential for avoiding the high-risk virus exposure to the operator. Taking advantage of magnetism and size mediated multiple physical fields, multiple influenza HA could be simultaneous separation and detection depended on different-size magnetic beads. Using high-luminance quantum dots as reporter, this assay achieved high sensitivity with a detection limit of 3.4 ng/mL for H7N9 HA and 4.5 ng/mL for H9N2 HA, and showed excellent specificity, anti-interference ability and good reproducibility. These results indicate that this method may propose new avenues for early detection of multiple influenza subtypes.","Wang, Shuibing; Ai, Zhao; Zhang, Zefen; Tang, Man; Zhang, Nangang; Liu, Feng; Han, Gujing; Hong, Shao-Li; Liu, Kan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,Elsevier,10.1016/j.snb.2020.127675,01/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-01

The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. In addition, under real weather conditions, the rooms in the street canyon have a high probability of experiencing a high reentry ratio based on the maximum reentry ratio of each room. This study provides authentic airflow and pollutant dispersion information in the street canyons in an urban environment. The dataset of this experiment can be used to validate further numerical simulations.","Dai, Yuwei; Mak, Cheuk Ming; Zhang, Yong; Cui, Dongjin; Hang, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,Elsevier,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106673,15/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-15

The 2019-nCoV is a novel virus so the majority of world’s population does not have prior immunity to it. It is more infectious and fatal than seasonal influenza, and definitive treatment and a vaccine are months away. Our arsenal against it are currently mainly social distancing and infection control measures.","Koh, Gerald Choon-Huat; Hoenig, Helen",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.03.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.03.003,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apmr.2020.03.003,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16

Meanwhile, we also studied the clinical characteristics of the cases, combined with CT manifestations, to provide more clues for the correct diagnosis of the disease. Six female patients (P1-P6) aged from 27 to 63 years were referred to the fever clinic of our hospital. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, malignant tumour or respiratory disease. Among the 6 cases, 5 (P1-P5) had a history of exposure to Wuhan or Hubei, and P6 had no clear epidemiological history. All the patients performed oropharyngeal swabs test and confirmed as COVID-19. Common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative. For patients’ venous blood tests at disease onset, as given in (Table 1), we found that leucocytes, lymphocytes and percentage were slightly decreased or normal, eosinophil count and percentage were slightly decreased in 4 cases and normal in 2 cases. Additionally, 4 days later, P1 reperformed the follow-up hematologic examination. Compared with the blood test at disease onset, the results showed that the eosinophil count was still below the normal range, which was even lower than the first time.","Zhu, Ying; Liu, Yang-Li; Li, Zi-Ping; Kuang, Jian-Yi; Li, Xiang-Min; Yang, You-You; Feng, Shi-Ting",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.022,Elsevier,MA ID 3005929298,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03

1456,Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Blood Safety,"Abstract With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, a new coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), aroused the attention of the entire world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections—SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012—both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by β-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas. In this review, we detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS–CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 through blood products as of February 10, 2020, and also discuss pathogen inactivation methods on coronaviruses.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Wang, Lunan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2020.02.003,Elsevier,MA ID 2892593968,21/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-21
1457,Interleukin-17 suppresses grass carp reovirus infection in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells by activating NF-κB signaling,"Abstract The grass carp accounts for a large proportion of aquacultural production in China, but the hemorrhagic disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection often causes huge economic losses to the industry. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-κB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-IκBα in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-κB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 acted as immune cytokines, exerting an antiviral effect by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.","Zhang, Yunshan; Zhang, Xing; Liang, Zi; Dai, Kun; Zhu, Min; Zhang, Mingtian; Pan, Jun; Xue, Renyu; Cao, Guangli; Tang, Jian; Song, Xuehong; Hu, Xiaolong; Gong, Chengliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,Elsevier,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.734969,15/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-15

1459,Analysis of therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of potential drugs by computational methods,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronavirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Wu, Canrong; Liu, Yang; Yang, Yueying; Zhang, Peng; Zhong, Wu; Wang, Yali; Wang, Qiqi; Xu, Yang; Li, Mingxue; Li, Xingzhou; Zheng, Mengzhu; Chen, Lixia; Li, Hua",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008,CZI,MA ID 2763848918,2020,NA,NA,2020
1460,Structure analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV,"2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.","Chen, Yun; Guo, Yao; Pan, Yihang; Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.071,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.071,CZI,MA ID 3006594788,2020,NA,NA,2020
1461,"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","Summary Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Methods The first-visit patients seeking emergency dental services before or at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic were retrieved. Their demographic characteristics and the reasons for visiting were recorded and analyzed. Results There were 2,537 patients involved in this study. Thirty-eight percent fewer patients visited the dental urgency at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic than before. The distribution of dental problems has changed significantly. The proportion of dental and oral infection raised from 51.0% of pre-COVID-19 to 71.9% during COVID-19, and dental trauma decreased from 14.2% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, the non-urgency cases reduced to three-tenths of pre-COVID-19.

1463,Enhanced nano-aerosol loading performance of multilayer PVDF nanofiber electret filters,"Abstract Aerosol loading behavior of PVDF nanofiber electret filters using neutrally charged nano- and submicron aerosols was investigated experimentally for the first time. The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm−1, which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters. The multilayer PVDF electret filters have excellent filtration performance for long-term aerosol filtration and also great potential applications in the fields of personal health care and environmental protection.","Sun, Qiangqiang; Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,Elsevier,10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606,01/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-01
1464,Clinical manifestations and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy,"Tang and colleagues, in this Journal, drew readers attention to emerging COVID19.1 We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy,2 pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. We identified all hospitalized pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between December 8, 2019, and February 25, 2020 officially reported by the central government, in areas outside Wuhan, China. Information including age, geographic location, epidemiological history, prenatal course, maternal and newborn hospital course, discharge data and outcome were obtained by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Local Health Commission. When necessary, we attempted to contact local hospital or patients by telephone to supply missing information. This investigation was part of an emergency public health outbreak investigation and therefore not subject to institutional review board. There were a total of 13 Chinese patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospitals outside of Wuhan (Table 1). There were 3 patients from Zhejiang, 3 from other cities of Hubei and 1 each from Fujian, Shanxi, Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Anhui. The maternal age ranged between 22 to 36 years.

1469,Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records,"Summary Background Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. Findings All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Interpretation The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

1471,Why is it difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 epidemic?,"Abstract Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan City in December of 2019, numerous model predictions on the COVID-19 epidemics in Wuhan and other parts of China have been reported. These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city.","Roda, Weston C.; Varughese, Marie B.; Han, Donglin; Li, Michael Y.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,Elsevier,10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

Recently, perioperative anesthetic management in patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus-2 has been reported. However, little has been reported on the anesthetic management of patients undergoing aortic dissection repair in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. During the outbreak in Wuhan, the authors’ team completed 4 cases of aortic dissection repair successfully in patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. The purpose of the present report is to summarize current knowledge and experiences on anesthetic management in this patient population and to provide clinical practice guidelines on anesthetic management and infection prevention and control in these critically ill patients.","He, Hao; Zhao, Shuai; Han, Linlin; Wang, Qi; Xia, Haifa; Huang, Xin; Yao, Shanglong; Huang, Jiapeng; Chen, Xiangdong",https://www.doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2020.03.021,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2020.03.021,Elsevier,10.1053/j.jvca.2020.03.021,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16

1474,Implications of COVID-19 for patients with pre-existing digestive diseases,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first reported in China, in December, 2019, now affects the whole world. As of March 8, 2020, more than 105 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 3500 deaths in over 100 countries had been reported. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected in a stool specimen of the first reported COVID-19 case in the USA,1 much attention has been paid to the study and reporting of gastrointestinal tract infection of SARS-CoV-2. According to a study2 including 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in China as of Jan 29, 2020, nausea or vomiting, or both, and diarrhoea were reported in 55 (5·6%) and 42 (3·8%) patients. Autopsy studies are crucial to help understand the involvement of COVID-19 in the digestive system; however, to date, there has been only one autopsy report3 for a man aged 85 years with COVID-19, which showed segmental dilatation and stenosis in the small intestine. Whether this finding is secondary to COVID-19 or a pre-existing gastrointestinal comorbidity is unknown.","Mao, Ren; Liang, Jie; Shen, Jun; Ghosh, Subrata; Zhu, Liang-Ru; Yang, Hong; Wu, Kai-Chun; Chen, Min-Hu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30076-5,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30076-5,Elsevier,10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30076-5,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

1477,On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern. Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses. Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by mutations and natural selection besides recombination. Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (∼70%) is more prevalent than the S type (∼30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure. These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Tang, Xiaolu; Wu, Changcheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Yuhe; Yao, Xinmin; Wu, Xinkai; Duan, Yuange; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Yirong; Qian, Zhaohui; Cui, Jie; Lu, Jian",https://www.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107875/,PMC,MA ID 2377437096,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03

1479,Chaos in a nonautonomous eco-epidemiological model with delay,"Abstract In this paper, we propose and analyze a nonautonomous predator-prey model with disease in prey, and a discrete time delay for the incubation period in disease transmission. Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov’s functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system’s behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasi-periodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.","Samanta, Sudip; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Alzahrani, Abdullah K.; Alshomrani, Ali Saleh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apm.2019.11.006,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1484,Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study,"Summary Background An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95 333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. Methods We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. Findings We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (R t) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of R t, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

1487,The effects of natural disasters on international tourism: A global analysis,"Tourism is shaped by a wide range of factors and forces, including exogenous ones that have no direct link with the tourism sector. Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing.","Rosselló, Jaume; Becken, Susanne; Santana-Gallego, Maria",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104080,31/08/2020,NA,NA,2020-08-31

The first case is a 57-year-old man with no relevant past medical, travel, or contact history, who presented to a regional hospital on Feb 9, 2020, with 3 days of fever and cough. He had thrombocytopenia (platelet count 140 × 109/mL) and a normal chest radiograph. He was discharged after a negative rapid test for dengue NS1, IgM, and IgG (SD Bioline Dengue Duo Kit; Abbott, South Korea). He returned to a public primary health-care clinic with persistent fever, worsening thrombocytopenia (89 × 109/mL), and new onset lymphopenia (0·43 × 109/mL). A repeat dengue rapid test was positive for dengue IgM and IgG (Dengue Combo; Wells Bio, South Korea). He was referred to hospital for dengue with worsening cough and dyspnoea. A chest radiograph led to testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in-house laboratory-developed test detecting the N and ORF1ab genes) from a nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive.

1490,EuNPs-mAb fluorescent probe based immunochromatographic strip for rapid and sensitive detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses in the pig industries. In this study, an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on a EuNPs-mAb fluorescent probe was developed and optimized for rapid detection of PEDV. The limit of detection (LOD) of the ICA was 0.218 μg/mL (2.725 × 103 TCID50/mL) and its linear detection range was 0.03125–8 μg/mL (3.91 × 102-105 TCID50/mL). The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples. 60 swine stool samples from southern China were analyzed by the ICA and RT-PCR, and the results showed that the coincidence rate of the ICA to RT-PCR was 86.67%, which was significantly higher than that of AuNPs based ICA. The ICA is sensitive and specific and can achieve on-site rapid detection of swine stool samples. Therefore, the ICA has a great potential for PED diagnosis and prevention.","Xu, Fei; Jin, Zhiyuan; Zou, Siyi; Chen, Chaoqun; Song, Qifang; Deng, Shengchao; Xiao, Wei; Zhang, Xiaoli; Jia, Aiqing; Tang, Yong",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.120865,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.120865,Elsevier,MA ID 2084580389,01/07/2020,NA,NA,2020-07-01
1491,A strategy to prevent future pandemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak,"A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world. At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.","Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J.; Li, Hongying",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.01.003,CZI,MA ID 3004767366,2020,NA,NA,2020

Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. The RT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acid test (NAT) was one of the most quickly established laboratory diagnosis method in a novel viral pandemic, just as in this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods 4880 cases that had respiratory infection symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients in hospital in Wuhan, China, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by use of quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. Positive rates were calculated in groups divided by genders or ages. Results The positive rate was about 38% for the total 4880 specimens. Male and older population had a significant higher positive rates. However, 57% was positive among the specimens from the Fever Clinics. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, not gender, was the risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fever clinics. Conclusions Therefore, we concluded that viral NAT played an important role in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Rui; Han, Huan; Liu, Fang; Lv, Zhihua; Wu, Kailang; Liu, Yingle; Feng, Yong; Zhu, Chengliang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.009,Elsevier,MA ID 2053972970,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

1497,Integrating traditional Chinese medicines into professional community pharmacy practice in China – Key stakeholder perspectives,"Abstract Introduction In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an integral part of the health system in parallel with Western medicine (WM). However, pharmacists’ duty of care at this interface has not been fully explored. This qualitative study aimed to explore key stakeholders’ perceptions about the challenges and enablers to pharmacists’ adopting a professional role in patient care associated with the concurrent use of herbal medicines (HMs). Methods Participants were recruited from the expert pool of the National Research Center for Licensed Pharmacist Development using purposive sampling and snowballing. Participants targeted included government, academics and practicing pharmacists. An interview guide was developed following a literature review and face-to-face, audiotaped interviews conducted with key stakeholders. Results Fourteen semi-structured interviews with both practicing pharmacists and key stakeholder representatives were conducted in China in 2017. Thematic analysis identified 6 main themes which focused on how TCM was integrated with WM in China. Participants agreed that pharmacists should at least assume a role in drug safety associated with concurrent use of TCM and WM. However, barriers were identified within the government, education, pharmacy, pharmacist and research sectors, indicating a lack of coordinated strategies to improve this area of healthcare. A lack of clarity in defining the pharmacists’ role in this area and a disconnect between current regulatory standards and education/training system were the prominent themes. Participants looked towards the government to facilitate actions in the development of policies that support pharmacy practice and practice guidelines, and the review of competency standards, and registration criteria as being the most important enablers. Conclusion Guiding principles that outline standards for pharmacy practice regarding HMs in an integrated healthcare system are considered a priority, requiring a joint effort from the government, professional organizations and universities.","Yao, Dongning; Hu, Hao; Harnett, Joanna E.; Ung, Carolina Oi Lam",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,Elsevier,10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101063,29/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-29
1498,First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA,"Summary Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. Findings Patient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.

1500,The deadly coronaviruses: The 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2020 novel coronavirus epidemic in China,"Abstract The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.","Yang, Yongshi; Peng, Fujun; Wang, Runsheng; Guan, Kai; Jiang, Taijiao; Xu, Guogang; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434,Elsevier,MA ID 2999409984,03/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-03
1501,The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak,"Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Rothan, Hussin A.; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433,Elsevier,MA ID 3006645647,26/02/2020,NA,NA,2020-02-26
1502,SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor,"Summary The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.","Hoffmann, Markus; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Schroeder, Simon; Krüger, Nadine; Herrler, Tanja; Erichsen, Sandra; Schiergens, Tobias S.; Herrler, Georg; Wu, Nai-Huei; Nitsche, Andreas; Müller, Marcel A.; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052,Elsevier,MA ID 3006448444,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
1503,"The Politics of Disease Epidemics: a Comparative Analysis of the SARS, Zika, and Ebola Outbreaks","Over the past few decades, disease outbreaks have become increasingly frequent and widespread. The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed, and could be linked to different economic contexts. Arguably, the responses to these outbreaks have been “political” and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations. Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings. Based on a review of the published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databases—PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science, the overall objective of this paper discuss scholars’ narratives on the “politics” of Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika virus in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting. Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature. The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature. While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts, the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited. Regardless of income setting, there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic. The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic—specifically poor communities—need to be represented in the literature. This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics.","Kapiriri, Lydia; Ross, Alison",https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y,CZI,MA ID 2890713974,2020,NA,NA,2020

1505,"Emerging infectious disease, the household built environment characteristics, and urban planning: Evidence on avian influenza in Vietnam","Abstract Recent concerns with pandemic outbreaks of human disease and their origins in animal populations have ignited concerns regarding connections between Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) and development. As disasters, health, and infectious disease become part of planning concern (Matthew & McDonald, 2007), greater focus on household infrastructure and EID disease outbreaks among poultry is warranted. Following Spencer (2013), this study examines the relationship between the mix of household-scale water supplies, sanitation systems, and construction materials, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) among poultry in a developing country: Vietnam. Findings of our multivariate logistic regressions suggest that a non-linear, Kuznets-shaped urban transition (Spencer, 2013) has an independent effect on the outbreak of HPAI, especially as it relates to household-level sanitation infrastructure. We conclude that the Kuznets-shape development of household infrastructure characteristics in Vietnam play a significant role in explaining where poultry outbreaks occur. Using secondary data from the Census of Population and Housing, and the Agricultural Census at the District and Commune levels for the country of Vietnam, we performed logistic regression to test the relationship between outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and newly-developed “coherence indices” (Spencer, 2013) of household water supply, sanitation, and construction materials that measure nonlinear, transitional development. Results show that district-scale coherence indices are negatively and independently correlated with HPAI outbreaks, especially for sanitation. Findings also suggest that community-scale coherence of urban infrastructures is a powerful tool for predicting where HPAI poultry outbreaks are likely to occur, thereby providing health planners new tools for efficient surveillance.","Spencer, James H.; Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson M.; Saksena, Sumeet; Sultana, Nargis",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,Elsevier,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103681,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31
1506,Specificity in PDZ-peptide interaction networks: Computational analysis and review,"Abstract Globular PDZ domains typically serve as protein–protein interaction modules that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions via recognition of short linear motifs (SLiMs). Often, PDZ mediated-interactions are essential components of macromolecular complexes, and disruption affects the entire scaffold. Due to their roles as linchpins in trafficking and signaling pathways, PDZ domains are attractive targets: both for controlling viral pathogens, which bind PDZ domains and hijack cellular machinery, as well as for developing therapies to combat human disease. However, successful therapeutic interventions that avoid off-target effects are a challenge, because each PDZ domain interacts with a number of cellular targets, and specific binding preferences can be difficult to decipher. Over twenty-five years of research has produced a wealth of data on the stereochemical preferences of individual PDZ proteins and their binding partners. Currently the field lacks a central repository for this information. Here, we provide this important resource and provide a manually curated, comprehensive list of the 271 human PDZ domains. We use individual domain, as well as recent genomic and proteomic, data in order to gain a holistic view of PDZ domains and interaction networks, arguing this knowledge is critical to optimize targeting selectivity and to benefit human health.","Amacher, Jeanine F.; Brooks, Lionel; Hampton, Thomas H.; Madden, Dean R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,Elsevier,10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100022,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

1508,New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?,"ABSTRACT Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials.

En Francia, la mutación más frecuente (alrededor del 80% de los casos) es la deleción del aminoácido 508 (fenilalanina), denominada F508del. La ausencia o la disfunción de la proteína CFTR provoca un defecto en el transporte de Cl– y un aumento de la reabsorción de sal y agua, en particular en el epitelio bronquial, lo que conlleva una reducción del líquido de la superficie bronquial. Esta exocrinopatía generalizada conduce a la producción de «moco viscoso» (de ahí el nombre de mucoviscidosis), que obstruye varios sitios en el cuerpo, en particular el sistema respiratorio, el tracto digestivo y sus anexos (páncreas, vías biliares e hígado). La detección neonatal se ha generalizado desde 2002. La prueba del sudor es la prueba complementaria de referencia, validada por la identificación de dos mutaciones patógenas, para la confirmación del diagnóstico. El tratamiento es multidisciplinario. Se basa ante todo en la kinesiterapia respiratoria diaria y el tratamiento de las sobreinfecciones broncopulmonares, así como en las recomendaciones nutricionales con el uso de extractos pancreáticos. Es probable que el pronóstico, todavía muy desfavorable, se modifique con la llegada de terapias proteínicas o de edición de ácido ribonucleico o de gen.","Noël, S.; Sermet-Gaudelus, I.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,Elsevier,10.1016/s1245-1789(20)43427-4,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1517,Manifestaciones neuroftalmológicas como complicación de una infección por Mycoplasma pneumoniae y desarrollo posterior de una encefalitis aguda diseminada,"Resumen El objetivo es describir dos cuadros clínicos neuroftalmológicos en niños por infección sistémica por Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). Se presentan los casos de dos niñas de 14 y 12 años que acudieron a urgencias: la primera con oftalmoplejía internuclear y la segunda con pérdida de visión y cefalea. No presentaban otra focalidad neurológica. En la imagen de resonancia magnética se evidenciaron placas hiperintensas en ambas, sugerentes de cuadro desmielinizante. Al mes, los síntomas neuroftalmológicos se resolvieron y las resonancias magnéticas de control fueron normales. El diagnóstico fue encefalitis diseminada aguda secundaria a M. pneumoniae. El diagnóstico se hace por PCR (gold standard) y/o IgM en serología. Es importante pensar en esta posible etiología ante casos sugerentes de enfermedad desmielinizante. Existe controversia sobre el papel de los antibióticos y si se contemplan los corticoides. Como conclusión, M. pneumoniae debe ser diagnóstico diferencial en afectaciones neuroftalmológicas agudas en niños. Abstract The purpose of this article is to describe two paediatric neuro-ophthalmological clinical cases caused by a systemic infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible aetiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children.","Molero-Senosiain, M.; Domingo-Gordo, B.; Fernández Cabrera, C.; Hernández-García, E.; Gómez de Liaño, R.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.oftal.2020.01.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oftal.2020.01.009,Elsevier,10.1016/j.oftal.2020.01.009,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05

Genomic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could be the possible primary reservoir. The intermediate source of origin and transfer to humans is not known, however, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. However, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been evaluated against COVID-19 in clinical trials, resulted in clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarize and comparatively analyze the emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection and previous human coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

1527,The building of social resilience in Sichuan after the Wenchuan earthquake: A perspective of the socio-government interactions,"Abstract In November 2007, China implemented its Emergency Response Law to ensure national unified leadership and collaboration when responding to emergencies. In recent years, China’s main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China’s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China’s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China’s disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform.","Wang, Chun-yuan; Guo, Jinyun; Kuo, Ming-feng",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104662,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

1529,"Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control","Abstract Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses (P < 0.001); however, no statistical difference was observed compared to the scores of non-front-line nurses (P > 0.05). Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially non-front-line nurses, and general public under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat vicarious traumatization in medical staff and general public are extremely necessary.","Li, Zhenyu; Ge, Jingwu; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Qiao, Mei; Jiang, Riyue; Bi, Jiangjiang; Zhan, Gaofeng; Xu, Xiaolin; Wang, Long; Zhou, Qin; Zhou, Chenliang; Pan, Yinbing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhang, Haiwei; Yang, Jianjun; Zhu, Bin; Hu, Yimin; Hashimoto, Kenji; Jia, Yan; Wang, Haofei; Wang, Rong; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007,10/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-10

1531,Public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in a coastal metropolis of Saudi Arabia,"Abstract Disaster risk reduction is an increasingly important policy issue, especially in developing countries that suffer most of the global human and economic losses associated with disasters. Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n = 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) = 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) = 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.","AlQahtany, Ali M.; Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101422,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30
1532,Study on the motion law of aerosols produced by human respiration under the action of thermal plume of different intensities,"Abstract Predicting influence of human thermal plume on the diffusion of respiration-produced particles is an important issue for improving indoor air quality through eliminating infectious microbes efficiently. In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.","Feng, Guohui; Bi, Yang; Zhang, Yixian; Cai, Yilin; Huang, Kailiang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,Elsevier,10.1016/j.scs.2019.101935,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

Aims The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 infection patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of sciences until February 25, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results Eight studies were included in the meta- analysis, including 46248 infected patients. The result showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91 ± 3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67 ± 7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51 ± 0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30 ± 4, 95% CI 21-40%). The most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension (17 ± 7, 95% CI 14-22%) and diabetes ( 8 ± 6, 95% CI 6-11% ), followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5 ± 4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2 ± 0, 95% CI 1-3% ). Compared with the Non-severe patient, the pooled odds ratio of hypertension, respiratory system disease, cardiovascular disease in severe patients were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively.

The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all <0.05. Interpretation The mortality of elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients, and the proportion of patients with PSI grade IV and V is significantly higher than that of young and middle-aged patients. Elderly patients with COVID-19 are more likely to progress to severe disease.","Liu, Kai; Chen, Ying; Lin, Ruzheng; Han, Kunyuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.005,27/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-27

1551,Testing the repatriated for SARS-Cov2: Should laboratory-based quarantine replace traditional quarantine?,"Abstract Background An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests). Conclusion Optimising our procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers.","Lagier, Jean Christophe; Colson, Philippe; Tissot Dupont, Hervé; Salomon, Jérôme; Doudier, Barbara; Aubry, Camille; Gouriet, Frédérique; Baron, Sophie; Dudouet, Pierre; Flores, Rémi; Ailhaud, Lucie; Gautret, Philippe; Parola, Philippe; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier; Brouqui, Philippe",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101624,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101624,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101624,14/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-14

In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.","Amirian, E.

1556,Role of vaccine efficacy in the vaccination behavior under myopic update rule on complex networks,"Abstract How to effectively prevent the diffusion of infectious disease has become an intriguing topic in the field of public hygienics. To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player’s own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.","Huang, Jiechen; Wang, Juan; Xia, Chengyi",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chaos.2019.109425,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

1558,Aetiology of Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex and Prevalence of its Pathogens in Europe,"Summary The canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is an endemic worldwide syndrome involving multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Traditionally, Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus (CHV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV) were considered the major causative agents. Lately, new pathogens have been implicated in the development of CIRDC, namely canine influenza virus (CIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. To better understand the role of the different pathogens in the development of CIRDC and their epidemiological relevance in Europe, prevalence data were collected from peer-reviewed publications and summarized. Evidence of exposure to Bb is frequently found in healthy and diseased dogs and client-owned dogs are as likely to be infected as kennelled dogs. Co-infections with viral pathogens are common. The findings confirm that Bb is an important cause of CIRDC in Europe. CAV-2 and CDV recovery rates from healthy and diseased dogs are low and the most likely explanation for this is control through vaccination. Seroconversion to CHV can be demonstrated following CIRDC outbreaks and CHV has been detected in the lower respiratory tract of diseased dogs. There is some evidence that CHV is not a primary cause of CIRDC, but opportunistically re-activates at the time of infection and exacerbates the disease. The currently available data suggest that CIV is, at present, neither a prevalent nor a significant pathogen in Europe. CPiV remains an important pathogen in CIRDC and facilitates co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens. CnPnV and CRCoV are important new elements in the aetiology of CIRDC and spread particularly well in multi-dog establishments. M. cynos is common in Europe and is more likely to occur in younger and kennelled dogs. This organism is frequently found together with other CIRDC pathogens and is significantly associated with more severe respiratory signs. S. zooepidemicus infection is not common and appears to be a particular problem in kennels. Protective immunity against respiratory diseases is rarely complete, and generally only a reduction in clinical signs and excretion of pathogen can be achieved through vaccination. However, even vaccines that only reduce and do not prevent infection carry epidemiological advantages. They reduce spread, increase herd immunity and decrease usage of antimicrobials. Recommending vaccination of dogs against pathogens of CIRDC will directly provide epidemiological advantages to the population and the individual dog.","Day, M.J.; Carey, S.; Clercx, C.; Kohn, B.; MarsilIo, F.; Thiry, E.; Freyburger, L.; Schulz, B.; Walker, D.J.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcpa.2020.02.005,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in China hardest-hit areas during COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the gender difference existing in PTSS. One month after the December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, we surveyed PTSS and sleep qualities among 285 residents in Wuhan and surrounding cities using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Hierarchical regression analysis and non-parametric test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%. Women reported significant higher PTSS in the domains of re-experiencing, negative alterations in cognition or mood, and hyper-arousal. Participants with better sleep quality or less frequency of early awakenings reported lower PTSS. Professional and effective mental health services should be designed in order to aid the psychological wellbeing of the population in affected areas, especially those living in hardest-hit areas, females and people with poor sleep quality.

1561,Coronavirus outbreak: the role of companies in preparedness and responses,"As in previous health crises, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has raised questions about preparedness and emergency responses in many countries. In this crisis, what role can companies play? Public and private companies must continue to produce or provide their services, but with consideration of the health context. Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization. Helped by their occupational practitioners, healthcare advisers, and safety professionals, companies that have a financial capacity and responsibilities (including governmental, federal, or state administrations) will thus have to prepare their business continuity planning for when cases of infected patients occur in the company. They also must be prepared for the potential psychosocial and psychological effects of outbreaks.

Given this pandemic situation, robust risk communication is urgently needed particularly in affected countries. Therefore, this study explored the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor public restlessness toward COVID-19 epidemic infection in Taiwan. Methods We retrieved GT data for the specific locations of Taiwan nationwide and subregions using defined search terms related to coronavirus, handwashing, and face masks. Results Searches related to COVID-19 and face masks in Taiwan increased rapidly, following the announcements of Taiwan’ first imported case and reached its peak as local cases were reported. However, searches for handwashing were gradually increased in period of face masks shortage. Moreover, high to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume (RSV) and COVID-19 cases were found in Taipei (lag-3), New Taipei (lag-2), Taoyuan (lag-2), Tainan (lag-1), Taichung (lag0), and Kaohsiung (lag0).

1566,Beijing's Hard and Soft Repression in Hong Kong,"Abstract Hong Kong's new Police Commissioner Chris Tang announced in Beijing on December 7, 2019, that he would use “both hard and soft approaches” to end the anti-government protests. This article argues that such “approaches” amount to physical and non-physical repression—hard power, but employed by Hong Kong, rather than mainland, forces, combined with sharp power exercised by both Beijing and the local authorities. These measures are responses to the limits on what Beijing can do under the “one country, two systems” model. As Beijing cannot send the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has subverted Hong Kong's once-respected civilian police force to act like the mainland's public security. And as Hong Kong's judiciary is relatively autonomous and many of the arrested would not be convicted or sentenced, the police have resorted to a decapacitation campaign to inflict direct violence on protesters. Moreover, as the city's freedom has allowed the public to support protesters in various ways, Beijing has launched a program of dismissal of pro-democracy individuals in both public and private sectors. To zoom in on Beijing's hard and soft repression, this article examines in closer detail the other “frontliners” at protest sites who provide professional services vital to the sustainability of protests: medics, firefighters, lawyers, journalists, and educators.","Hui, Victoria Tin-bor",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,Elsevier,10.1016/j.orbis.2020.02.010,31/12/2020,NA,NA,2020-12-31

We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5–21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients’ nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0·05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0·05). Conclusion In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.","Deng, Lisi; Li, Chunna; Zeng, Qi; Liu, Xi; Li, Xinghua; Zhang, Haitang; Hong, Zhongsi; Xia, Jinyu",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002,11/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-11

1570,Early epidemiological analysis of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak based on crowdsourced data: a population-level observational study,"Summary Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks. Methods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time. Findings We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020. Interpretation News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

1579,Active fractions of mannoproteins derived from yeast cell wall stimulate innate and acquired immunity of adult and elderly dogs,"Abstract Nutritional intervention in older dogs aims to increase lifespan and improve life quality as well as delay the development of diseases related to ageing. It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.","Kroll, F.S.A.; Putarov, T.C.; Zaine, L.; Venturini, K.S.; Aoki, C.G.; Santos, J.P.F.; Pedrinelli, V.; Vendramini, T.H.A.; Brunetto, M.A.; Carciofi, A.C.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,Elsevier,10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114392,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1581,2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak: A new challenge,"Abstract Objectives Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment. Methods The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library. Search terms included ‘novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV’ or ‘COVID-19’. Results Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8–92 years). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease. Conclusion The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities.","Lupia, Tommaso; Scabini, Silvia; Mornese Pinna, Simone; Di Perri, Giovanni; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Corcione, Silvia",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.02.021,Elsevier,MA ID 3003218364,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

A simulation for 2018–2021 demonstrates the sustained impact of this policy. The results show that the number of tourists to Taiwan from China reached its peak in 2015 at 41% and will decrease to 9% by 2021. The corresponding tourism revenue will decrease from 49% to 11% over the same period. The results also show that if the number of tourists from China remains above 836,772, the number of tourists from Japan, Hong Kong, Australasia, North America, and Europe will still increase. However, the number of tourists from South Korea and South and Southeast Asia will increase continuously regardless of tourists from China, even far below 836,772.","Liou, Je-Liang; Hsu, Pei-Chun; Wu, Pei-Ing",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,Elsevier,10.1016/j.tourman.2019.104055,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

1587,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We have read with great interest the Correspondence by Shibo Jiang and colleagues,1 in which they propose a name change for the newly emerged coronavirus,2 which was recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.3 The authors argued that the use of SARS in the virus name could confuse the public about the disease that it causes; in addition, they noted that the name SARS-CoV-2 is not consistent with the disease name chosen by WHO, coronavirus disease 2019. The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate. To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has established standardised formats for classifying viruses. Under these rules, a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on phylogeny and taxonomy.4 Through DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering-based analyses,5 the newly emerged coronavirus was deemed not sufficiently novel but is a sister virus to SARS-CoV, the primary viral isolate defining the species. The SARS-CoV species includes viruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV_PC4-227, and SARSr-CoV-btKY72. SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of this viral species. The use of SARS in naming SARS-CoV-2 does not derive from the name of the SARS disease but is a natural extension of the taxonomic practice for viruses in the SARS species. The use of SARS for viruses in this species mainly refers to their taxonomic relationship to the founding virus of this species, SARS-CoV. In other words, viruses in this species can be named SARS regardless of whether or not they cause SARS-like diseases.","Wu, Yuntao; Ho, Wenzhe; Huang, Yaowei; Jin, Dong-Yan; Li, Shiyue; Liu, Shan-Lu; Liu, Xuefeng; Qiu, Jianming; Sang, Yongming; Wang, Qiuhong; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30557-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30557-2,Elsevier,MA ID 2047323912,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

1591,In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus,"Objective In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify treatments containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 treatments were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.","Zhang, Deng-hai; Wu, Kun-lun; Zhang, Xue; Deng, Sheng-qiong; Peng, Bin",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005,CZI,MA ID 1577002143,2020,NA,NA,2020
1592,"Higher tourism specialization, better hotel industry efficiency?","Abstract This study examines the effects of both specialization in tourism and market competition on the efficiency of the hotel industry. For this purpose, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) was employed to evaluate the efficiency of the hotel industry on a provincial level in China and to analyze how it is impacted by specialization in tourism and market competition. The results confirm that tourism specialization and market competition exert a synergistic effect on hotel industry efficiency in China. This study finds that tourism development as represented by a high level of tourism specialization by a destination does not guarantee high efficiency in hotels but does enhance the negative effect of market competition on hotel industry efficiency. Significant policy and managerial implications stem from these findings.","Zhang, Dapeng; Tu, Jinghua; Zhou, Lingxu; Yu, Zhiyuan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102509,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
1593,"Trump’s “America first” energy policy, contingency and the reconfiguration of the global energy order","Abstract The global energy system is in transition to a new energy order characterized by the emergence of the United States as a net oil exporter, the shale revolution and the gradual shift towards low-carbon sources and renewables. The shale boom in the US was a game changer, as was the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trump pushed an ambitious “America first” agenda aimed at transforming the US into a global energy superpower. The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, it outlines the key pillars of the emerging global energy order. Second, it underscores the role of contingent events, a factor neglected by some previous studies because of their reliance on what A.O.Hirschman (1970) termed “paradigmatic thinking”. The recent transition in the international energy order is an outcome of two paramount, yet largely unanticipated events: the shale revolution in the US and Trump’s neomercantilist and unilateralist economic policies. While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these developments for global energy governance.","Guliyev, Farid",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,Elsevier,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111435,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31

1596,Potential role of inanimate surfaces for the spread of coronaviruses and their inactivation with disinfectant agents,"Summary The novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62% - 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Other compounds such as 0.05% - 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. An effective surface disinfection may help to ensure an early containment and prevention of further viral spread.","Kampf, Günter",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100044,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100044,CZI,MA ID 3006062275,2020,NA,NA,2020
1597,Effect of pollutant source location on air pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building,"Abstract This article investigates the dispersion of airborne pollutants emitted from different locations near a high-rise building. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design.","Keshavarzian, Erfan; Jin, Ruizhi; Dong, Kejun; Kwok, Kenny C.S.; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Ming",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,Elsevier,10.1016/j.apm.2020.01.019,31/05/2020,NA,NA,2020-05-31
1598,Taking the right measures to control COVID-19,"First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.","Xiao, Yonghong; Torok, Mili Estee",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30152-3,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30152-3,Elsevier,MA ID 3006007867,05/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-05
1599,Outbreak investigation for COVID-19 in northern Vietnam,"Two Vietnamese adults returned to their home province of Vinh Phuc in northern Vietnam on Jan 17, 2020, from Wuhan, China, where they had been living since Nov 15, 2019, for a business trip. They presented with mild respiratory symptoms to their local health facilities at 4 days and 8 days, respectively, after arrival in Vinh Phuc. Both individuals were initially placed into respiratory isolation in hospital. Case 1 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative organism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on Jan 30, 2020, and remained in isolation until recovery. Case 2 was discharged from isolation in hospital after having one negative test result on Jan 28 (11 days after returning from Wuhan). Following discharge, the patient attended a family social function. 2 days later, she was readmitted after a second nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken during her time in hospital was reported as positive. Screening of 79 individuals who had been in contact with these two patients (namely, family members in the same household and anyone who had been within 2 m of them) was initiated on Jan 31. Six individuals from the same work team, who had also travelled from Wuhan on Jan 17, were isolated, and four of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3, 4, and 8 in Vinh Phuc, and one case from another province). Five secondary cases were diagnosed within the social network of case 2. These included three household members (cases 6, 7, and 11) and two people who had attended the social function (cases 5 and 9; appendix p 1). Four of these individuals reported mild respiratory symptoms; the remaining patient was asymptomatic (case 7) at the time of diagnosis.","Thanh, Hai Nguyen; Van, Truong Nguyen; Thu, Huong Ngo Thi; Van, Binh Nghiem; Thanh, Binh Doan; Thu, Ha Phung Thi; Kieu, Anh Nguyen Thi; Viet, Nhung Nguyen; Marks, Guy B; Fox, Greg J; Nguyen, Thu-Anh",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30159-6,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30159-6,Elsevier,MA ID 2904779985,04/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-04

1601,Incidence and Impact of Community Respiratory Viral Infection (CRV) in Haploidentical and Matched Sibling Donors Receiving Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy): A CIBMTR Analysis,"There are reports of high rates of viral infections after haploidentical transplant, particularly in the setting of PTCy (HaploCy) but detailed data on incidence are lacking. We describe here the comparative incidence of community respiratory virus (CRV) infections occurring by day 180 post-transplant by donor source and their impact on outcomes including survival, relapse, chronic GVHD, and transplant related mortality (TRM) using CIBMTR registry data. The analysis included 2765 patients, all > 2 years of age, who underwent first allogeneic HCT for AML, ALL or MDS from 100 centers between 2012 and 2017 receiving either HaploCy (n=757), Matched related donor (MRD) transplant with PTCy (SibCy n= 403), and MRD transplant with calcineurin inhibitor and either MTX or MMF (SibCNI n= 1605). The cumulative incidences of CRV in the HaploCy, SibCy and SibCNI were: 3% (99% CI, 1.6-4.8), 3% (1.3-5.5) and 2.4 %(1.5-3.5) respectively at day 30 (P =0.649, NS), but notably higher at 15.5% (12.3-19), 16.2% (11.7-21.2) and 9.4 %(7.6-11.4) at 6 months (P<.001) post-transplant [Figure 1]. Identified CRV included primarily Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, and RSV accounting for approximately 70% of all CRV reported [Table 1]. Figure 2 shows the multivariable models through 2 years post-transplant for survival, relapse, TRM, and chronic GVHD with a reference group of SibCNI without CRV infection for the main effect variable of donor type and infection. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRV by day 180 had a higher risk of TRM [p=0.002] and inferior survival [p = 0.001] compared to the reference group. Older age, more advanced disease, and higher HCT-CI were all associated with increased mortality. The incidence of CRVs is higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor. This finding justifies further studies to understand long-term antiviral immune recovery in different donor sources and GVHD prophylaxis regimens. The higher overall mortality for HaploCy patients developing CRV infection warrants consideration for patient education and heightened awareness for clinicians, as well as long term follow up studies of such patients.","Taplitz, Randy; Maziarz, Richard T.; Mulroney, Carolyn; Perales, Miguel; Romee, Rizwan; Goldsmith, Scott R.; Fuchs, Ephraim J.; Bashey, Asad; Ciurea, Stefan O.; Singh, Anurag K; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Kim, Soyoung; Chen, Min; Chemaly, Roy F.; Komanduri, Krishna V.; Riches, Marcie L.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,Elsevier,10.1016/j.bbmt.2019.12.219,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31
1602,IoT PCR for pandemic disease detection and its spread monitoring,"Abstract During infectious disease outbreaks, the centers for disease control need to monitor particular areas. Considerable effort has been invested in the development of portable, user-friendly, and cost-effective systems for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, which could also create an Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare via a global network. However, at present IoT based on a functional POC instrument is not available. Here we show a fast, user-friendly, and affordable IoT system based on a miniaturized polymerase chain reaction device. We demonstrated the system’s capability by amplification of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the dengue fever virus. The resulting data were then automatically uploaded via a Bluetooth interface to an Android-based smartphone and then wirelessly sent to a global network, instantly making the test results available anywhere in the world. The IoT system presented here could become an essential tool for healthcare centers to tackle infectious disease outbreaks identified either by DNA or ribonucleic acid.","Zhu, Hanliang; Podesva, Pavel; Liu, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Haoqing; Teply, Tomas; Xu, Ying; Chang, Honglong; Qian, Airong; Lei, Yingfeng; Li, Yu; Niculescu, Andreea; Iliescu, Ciprian; Neuzil, Pavel",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,Elsevier,10.1016/j.snb.2019.127098,15/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-15

1605,Numerical investigation of gaseous pollutant cross-transmission for single-sided natural ventilation driven by buoyancy and wind,"Abstract Single-sided natural ventilation was numerically investigated to determine the impact of buoyancy and wind on the cross-transmission of pollution by considering six window types commonly found in multistory buildings. The goal of this study was to predict the gaseous pollutant transmission using computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and baseline k-ω turbulence equations. The results indicated that ventilation rates generally increased with increasing wind speeds if the effects of buoyancy and wind were not suppressed; however, the re-entry ratio representing the proportion of expelled air re-entering other floors and the corresponding risk of infection decreased. If the source of the virus was on a central floor, the risk of infection was the highest on the floors closest to the source. Different window types were also considered for determining their effectiveness in controlling cross-transmission and infection risk, depending on the source location and driving force (e.g., buoyancy and wind).","Wang, Jihong; Huo, Qiannan; Zhang, Tengfei; Wang, Shugang; Battaglia, Francine",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,Elsevier,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course. It remains unclear at this point to what extent chronic liver diseases should be considered as risk factors, due to a shortage of appropriate studies. However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention. Thus, the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritise outpatient contacts, avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers, and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention.","Boettler, Tobias; Newsome, Philip N.; Mondelli, Mario U.; Maticic, Mojca; Cordero, Elisa; Cornberg, Markus; Berg, Thomas",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jhepr.2020.100113,30/06/2020,NA,NA,2020-06-30

1618,Composition of human-specific slow codons and slow di-codons in SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are lower than other coronaviruses suggesting a faster protein synthesis rate of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV,"Abstract Translation of a genetic codon without a cognate tRNA gene is affected by both the cognate tRNA availability and the interaction with non-cognate isoacceptor tRNAs. Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.","Yang, Chu-Wen; Chen, Mei-Fang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.002,10/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-10

1622,A Sequence Homology and Bioinformatic Approach Can Predict Candidate Targets for Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2,"Summary Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it. However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.","Grifoni, Alba; Sidney, John; Zhang, Yun; Scheuermann, Richard H.; Peters, Bjoern; Sette, Alessandro",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002,Elsevier,10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.002,16/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-16

The feasibility study investigates the reliability of the state of the art heart rate measuring methods in realistic situations. Therefore, an experiment was designed and carried out on 45 subjects to investigate the effects caused by illumination, motion, skin tone, and distance variance. The experiment was conducted for two main scenarios; human-computer interaction scenario and health monitoring scenario. The human-computer scenario investigated the effects caused by illumination variance, motion variance, and skin tone variance. The health monitoring scenario investigates the feasibility of health monitoring at public spaces (i.e. airports, subways, malls). Five state of the art heart rate measuring methods were re-implemented and tested with the feasibility study database. The results were compared with ground truth to estimate the heart rate measurement error. The heart rate measurement error was analyzed using mean error, standard deviation; root means square error and Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings of this experiment inferred promising results for health monitoring of subjects standing at a distance of 500 cm.","Hassan, M.A.; Malik, A.S.; Fofi, D.; Karasfi, B.; Meriaudeau, F.",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,Elsevier,10.1016/j.measurement.2019.07.032,31/01/2020,NA,NA,2020-01-31

Methods We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. Results Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3–7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3–38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3–14, 6–8 and 7–9 days, respectively. Conclusions Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir using.

1642,Quantitative computed tomography analysis for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Abstract Purpose To examine the feasibility of using a computer tool for stratifying the severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, <1/3 involvement; 2, >1/3 and < 2/3 involvement; and 3, >2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P < 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = −0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (χ2 = 8.160, P = 0.004). Conclusions Our experiments demonstrated that the computer tool could reliably and accurately assess the severity and distribution of pneumonia on CT scans.","Shen, Cong; Yu, Nan; Cai, Shubo; Zhou, Jie; Sheng, Jiexin; Liu, Kang; Zhou, Heping; Guo, Youmin; Niu, Gang",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.004,Elsevier,MA ID 2970191042,06/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-06

1649,"Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein","Summary The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in >90,000 infections and >3,000 deaths. Coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells and are the main target of antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs. We determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","Walls, Alexandra C.; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M.

1651,A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"Abstract Purpose COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.","Cortegiani, Andrea; Ingoglia, Giulia; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Giarratano, Antonino; Einav, Sharon",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005,Elsevier,10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005,10/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-10
1652,Temporal and spatial evolution of online public sentiment on emergencies,"Abstract The transmission of online emergency information has become an active means of expressing public opinion and has vitally affected societal emergency response techniques. This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types—natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events—and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.","Li, Shiyue; Liu, Zixuan; Li, Yanling",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,Elsevier,10.1016/j.ipm.2019.102177,31/03/2020,NA,NA,2020-03-31

1658,The history of respiratory disease management,"Abstract Over the past 200 years lung diseases have shifted from infections – tuberculosis, pneumonia – to diseases of dirty air – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer. New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV infection, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, β2-adrenoceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to universal coverage in both primary and hospital care. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine. Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.","Geddes, Duncan",https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,Elsevier,10.1016/j.mpmed.2020.01.007,30/04/2020,NA,NA,2020-04-30

1660,Subunit Vaccines Against Emerging Pathogenic Human Coronaviruses,"Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far. Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated. Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.
